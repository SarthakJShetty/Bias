The role of earth observation data was recognized towards achieving international biodiversity targets by 2020. Ecosystem irreplaceability and ecosystem vulnerability are two concepts key to understanding and preparing conservation priority maps. This study presents spatial conservation prioritization analysis for forests of Ghats biodiversity Earth observation data products have been used for prioritization of areas of irreplaceability and vulnerability that are significant for conservation planning. The spatial surrogates of biodiversity in terms of very dense forest, biological richness, intactness and rarity of habitat are analyzed for evaluation of ecosystem irreplaceability. Fragmentation, forest fires, plant invasion and disturbance index are surrogates included for spatial analysis of ecosystem vulnerability. Vegetation type wise analysis indicates dry deciduous forests are under high vulnerability, followed by moist deciduous forests. The high concentration of irreplaceability is observed in Shola followed by wet evergreen forests and semi-evergreen forests. Spatial prioritization approach has identified about 18% of the forest area as irreplaceable which represents overlapped area of very dense forest, shola, intact forest and high biological richness. We observed that the overlap of forest areas of irreplaceability with vulnerability in southern Western Ghats, which needs high priority of conservation. This study is the first of its kind wherein multi-source earth observation data has been analysed to examine the quantitative criteria at regional level in Western Ghats.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'In fast-changing tropical landscapes, effective strategies for conservation must incorporate information on ecosystems and species distribution with that on landscape change. A possible methodology for conservation prioritization is developed and illustrated using a 27.5 km2 tropical landscape in the Western Ghats hill chain of southern India. Vegetation types or ecosystems within the landscape are ranked based on the ecosystem services they might provide: number of endemic species harbored, species richness, contribution to carbon uptake, economic value of produce per ha and contribution to soil renewal. For a vegetation type, the weighted average of these ranks indicates its net conservation value. Weights thus provide a means of ascribing differential importance to an ecosystem service. Information on landscape change is also summarized by a matrix depicting the likelihood of transformations between vegetation types present in the landscape, projected 5 years into the future. For each transformation between two vegetation types, information on ecosystem service and dynamics is then integrated. Implications from the perspective of conservation are assessed as the product of transformation probability and the resultant gain/loss in conservation value. Strongly positive transformations are likely to result in positive impacts on conservation value, and occur without any additional conservation effort. Strongly negative transformations are likely to occur and have a strong negative impact on conservation value. Maximum conservation effort may be directed at halting or reversing these. This study thus describes a method for conservation prioritization, which integrates information on ecosystem function and services with ecosystem dynamics.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'We assessed the distribution and abundance of 4 species of diurnal primates viz. lion-tailed macaque, bonnet macaque, Nilgiri langur and Hanuman langur, in 2 and rain forests of the Western Ghats in the state of Karnataka, India. The Nilgiri langurs in Brahmagiri-Makut and the lion-tailed macaques in Sirsi-Honnavara are the northernmost populations of the 2 species in the Western Ghats. The 2 regions represent changes in ecological zones in the Western Ghats. In Brahmagiri-Makut, Hanuman langurs and bonnet macaques occupy lower elevations whereas Nilgiri langurs live in relatively higher altitudes. Only one group of lion-tailed macaques was in Brahmagiri-Makut. In the forests of Sirsi-Honnavara, 3 species of primates viz. lion-tailed macaque, bonnet macaque and Hanuman langur were in larger numbers throughout the forest. A self-sustainable single population of 32 groups of lion-tailed macaques occurred in Sirsi-Honnavara. Few subspecies of Hanuman langurs exist in the study regions. Due to local hunting practices, the relative abundance of primates in Brahmagiri-Makut is lower than that in Sirsi-Honnavara.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Hill forts of Northern Western Ghats offer an interesting mix of man-made and natural habitats and as a result shelter a great diversity of endemic and threatened plants. Strict protection of certain areas and selective interference for strategic reasons on hill forts are responsible for maintenance of large protected populations of local endemic species. This has also created special patterns of plant distribution. In recent years, many novelties have been described from forts. Though hill forts have gained importance from the historical and archeological point of view, they are seldom considered as biodiversity conservatories. We suggest here that while prioritizing conservation areas in Northern Western Ghats, hill forts should be given a status of local biodiversity hotspots and conservation should be provided to all microhabitats that are natural as well as man-made. This will assure protection of endemic and threatened species of Western Ghats as well as local endemics of Northern Western Ghats.'\"], [\"hotspot, Tamil Nadu, India'\"], [\"Abstract: 'This study highlights spatial characterization of evergreen forests of the Western Ghats an ecological hotspot in Tamil Nadu, India using remote sensing and GIS-based analysis in conjunction with ground-based phytosociological data. The evergreen forests of Tamil Nadu are distributed in four distinct hill ranges, Nilgiri, Anamalai, Palni and Tirunelveli, having different topographic, bioclimatic and disturbance levels. The evergreen forests in these four hill ranges are characterized for their uniqueness in terms of patch characteristics and phytosociology. A vegetation type map was prepared using IRS LISS III satellite data and was used to study the patch characteristics in terms of patch size, number, shape, porosity and landcover diversity (LD). The phytosociological characteristics, namely species richness, diversity, similarity and community assemblages, were studied using ground data collected from 95 sample points of 0.1 ha size. Patch size and number revealed distinct intactness and disturbance levels in these four hill ranges. Evergreen forests in the Tirunelveli hills comprising 216.09 km2 are distributed in 306 patches, and in the Palni hills, with 285 km2, forests are distributed in 1029 patches, indicating a high level of fragmentation. LD, indicating the spatial heterogeneity of landcover, was very high in the Nilgiri hills and low in the Tirunelveli hills. The spatial analysis helped to delineate homogenous large patches of evergreen forest, which can be adopted for appropriate conservation strategies. A total of 342 tree species belonging to 4490 stems were evaluated for phytosociology. Only of similarity in terms of species distribution was found across the hill ranges. Conjunctive analysis of patch characteristics and species distribution showed high species richness in less fragmented evergreen forests and vice versa. The study identified the areas of prioritization in terms of ecorestoration and conservation based on patch and phytosociological characteristics.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Seventy one fish species belonging to 27 families and 50 genera were collected from various sampling sites spread along the upstream and downstream parts of the Chalakudy river, in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in Kerala, South India. Cyprinids were the most dominant group represented by 24 species belonging to 13 genera, followed by the catfishes of the family Bagridae (7 species from 2 genera) and loaches belonging to the family Balitoridae (5 species from 5 genera). Of the 71 species, 4 belong to the (CR) and 16 to the (EN) category. 3 of the critically endangered species are strictly endemic to the Chalakudy river system. We also collected 5 exotic species several of them categorized as potential pest. Fish species richness (FSR) showed a direct relationship with increasing stream order with maximum values observed in the downstream/low elevation regions. Considerable differences were observed in the FSR between different microhabitats with maximum values observed in bed rock and pool riffle and the lowest in regimes followed by step pools. Diversity and species richness decreased with increasing altitude and higher diversity and species richness were observed in sampling sites located between above sea level. A definite temporal partitioning was also observed with regard to FSR with higher richness during the day time and the lowest observed at dawn. Indiscriminate collection of endemic and threatened ornamental fish species for export, exploitation of endangered food fishes by forest-dwelling communities and local fisher folk, pollution, loss of riparian cover, damming and exotic species threaten the rich ichthyofaunal diversity of Chalakudy River. An urgent need exists for studying the life history traits and demography of the most important endemic and threatened fishes, as lack of information on these aspects have significantly affected conservation efforts. The implementation of strong management strategies like fixing total allowable catch (TAC), and the use of quotas are needed to reduce the overall collection pressure with regard to the trade in native ornamental species from the river.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'In order to understand the vegetative and reproductive phenological behaviour of Syzygium caryophyllatum, the knowledge of the factor influencing leaf flushing, maturation, leaf fall, flowering and fruiting of this tree species is required. The authors used field observations collected over at Neeliyarkottam sacred grove, Kannur district, Western Ghats of Kerala, India, to characterize the relationship between phenological pattern and biotic and abiotic (climatic) factors. The relationship between phenological pattern of the selected species and abiotic variables such as precipitation and temperature exhibited significant variation among the species. Flowering begins from second week of March to till May with a peak in April followed by the fruiting. Hand pollination tests indicated that most of the fruits were developed through xenogamous pollination. The breeding test results indicated S. caryophyllatum is self-incompatible and out-crossing is fertile. The foraging activities of some common pollinators on S. caryophyllatum flowers were also studied. The main flower visitors and foragers include honey bees, different varieties of butterflies, wasps, carpenter bees, small flies, bugs and ants. The flowering and fruiting exclusively occur in the dry season and are followed by germination and establishment of seedlings during the subsequent rainy season. The authors conclude that the investigations on the reproductive phenology, floral biology, breeding systems and pollinator visitation are important due to population survival of the species and its evolutionary success.'\"], [\"India'\"], [\"Abstract: ' Decalepis arayalpathra, a critically endangered plant species, has a restricted and fragmented population in Southern Western Ghats, India.

This study in a biodiversity hotspot and endemic bird area, the Western Ghats mountains of India, examined the effects of habitat structure, floristics, and adjacent habitats on bird communities in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and tropical rainforest fragments. Habitat and birds were sampled in 13 sites: six fragments (three relatively isolated and three with canopy connectivity with adjoining shade-coffee plantations and forests), six plantations differing in canopy tree species composition (five coffee and one cardamom), and one undisturbed primary rainforest control site in the Anamalai hills. Around 3300 detections of 6000 individual birds belonging to 106 species were obtained. The coffee plantations were poorer than rainforest in rainforest bird species, particularly endemic species, but the rustic cardamom plantation with diverse, native rainforest shade trees, had bird species richness and abundance comparable to primary rainforest. Plantations and fragments that adjoined habitats providing greater tree canopy connectivity supported more rainforest and fewer open-forest bird species and individuals than sites that lacked such connectivity. These effects were mediated by strong positive effects of vegetation structure, particularly woody plant variables, cane, and bamboo, on bird community structure. Bird community composition was however positively correlated only to floristic (tree species) composition of sites. The maintenance or restoration of habitat structure and (shade) tree species composition in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and rainforest fragments can aid in rainforest bird conservation in the regional landscape.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Conservation initiatives are designed to address threats to forests and biodiversity, often through partnerships with natural-resource users who are incentivized to change their land-use and livelihood practices to avoid further biodiversity loss. In particular, direct incentives programmes that provide monetary benefits are commended for being effective in achieving conservation across short timescales. In biodiversity-rich areas, outside protected areas, such as coffee agroforestry systems, direct incentives, such as certification schemes, are used to motivate coffee producers to maintain native tree species, natural vegetation, restrict wildlife hunting, and conserve soil and water, in addition to encouraging welfare of workers. However, despite these claims, there is a lack of strong evidence of the on-ground impact of such schemes. To assess the conservation importance of certification, we describe a case study in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot of India, in which coffee growers are provided price incentives to adopt Rainforest Alliance certification standards. We analyse the conservation and social outcomes of this programme by studying experiences of participating in certification. Despite high compliance and effective implementation, we find a strong case for the endorsement of as with no changes in farm management as a result of certification. We find that such as participation in certification creates grounds for diminishing credibility and local support for conservation efforts.

The forest edges are affected by anthropogenic activities including deforestation, forest fragmentation, selective logging, extraction of non-timber forest products, collection of medicinal plants, recreations, hydroelectric projects and its associated developmental activities, which alter the biodiversity. The present study intends to evaluate the edge effect on vegetation structure and species compositions in the tropical forest ecosystems at Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary in the Western Ghats. High species richness (number of species) and diversity indices were observed in the site III (completely undisturbed forest) compared to site I (adjacent to the village/ edge of the forest, which is next to the teak plantation, severely disturbed forest) and site II (in between the undisturbed forest and moderately disturbed forest) while density of tree species showed greater value in site II. Single species such as Tectona grandis (IVI of 80) and Terminalia paniculata (IVI of 112) were the dominant tree species in site I and site II, respectively, whereas, in site III Terminalia bellirica, Bishofia javanica and Syzgium gardneri shared the dominance. Perturbation leads to alien plant invasion particularly Lantana camara, Eupatorium odoratum and Ageratum conizoides. Site II is at forest transition level because the site is dominated by both natural species as well as plantation species such as Tectona grandis.

Half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 3% sugar and 1.5 mg kinetin in jam bottles facilitated storage of shoots up to 14 months without subculture which developed 25 shoots. Elimination of sugar from the above medium increased the storage period to 20 months. The shoots on this medium exhibited reduced growth and developed less than 12 shoots. Half-strength growth regulator free medium with sugar exhibited very slow growth and developed less than five shoots. This medium facilitated storage up to 20 months.

This study presents spatial conservation prioritization analysis for forests of Ghats biodiversity Earth observation data products have been used for prioritization of areas of irreplaceability and vulnerability that are significant for conservation planning. The spatial surrogates of biodiversity in terms of very dense forest, biological richness, intactness and rarity of habitat are analyzed for evaluation of ecosystem irreplaceability. Fragmentation, forest fires, plant invasion and disturbance index are surrogates included for spatial analysis of ecosystem vulnerability. Vegetation type wise analysis indicates dry deciduous forests are under high vulnerability, followed by moist deciduous forests. The high concentration of irreplaceability is observed in Shola followed by wet evergreen forests and semi-evergreen forests. Spatial prioritization approach has identified about 18% of the forest area as irreplaceable which represents overlapped area of very dense forest, shola, intact forest and high biological richness.

A possible methodology for conservation prioritization is developed and illustrated using a 27.5 km2 tropical landscape in the Western Ghats hill chain of southern India. Vegetation types or ecosystems within the landscape are ranked based on the ecosystem services they might provide: number of endemic species harbored, species richness, contribution to carbon uptake, economic value of produce per ha and contribution to soil renewal. For a vegetation type, the weighted average of these ranks indicates its net conservation value. Weights thus provide a means of ascribing differential importance to an ecosystem service. Information on landscape change is also summarized by a matrix depicting the likelihood of transformations between vegetation types present in the landscape, projected 5 years into the future. For each transformation between two vegetation types, information on ecosystem service and dynamics is then integrated. Implications from the perspective of conservation are assessed as the product of transformation probability and the resultant gain/loss in conservation value. Strongly positive transformations are likely to result in positive impacts on conservation value, and occur without any additional conservation effort. Strongly negative transformations are likely to occur and have a strong negative impact on conservation value. Maximum conservation effort may be directed at halting or reversing these.

Strict protection of certain areas and selective interference for strategic reasons on hill forts are responsible for maintenance of large protected populations of local endemic species. This has also created special patterns of plant distribution. In recent years, many novelties have been described from forts. Though hill forts have gained importance from the historical and archeological point of view, they are seldom considered as biodiversity conservatories. We suggest here that while prioritizing conservation areas in Northern Western Ghats, hill forts should be given a status of local biodiversity hotspots and conservation should be provided to all microhabitats that are natural as well as man-made.

The evergreen forests in these four hill ranges are characterized for their uniqueness in terms of patch characteristics and phytosociology. A vegetation type map was prepared using IRS LISS III satellite data and was used to study the patch characteristics in terms of patch size, number, shape, porosity and landcover diversity (LD). The phytosociological characteristics, namely species richness, diversity, similarity and community assemblages, were studied using ground data collected from 95 sample points of 0.1 ha size. Patch size and number revealed distinct intactness and disturbance levels in these four hill ranges. Evergreen forests in the Tirunelveli hills comprising 216.09 km2 are distributed in 306 patches, and in the Palni hills, with 285 km2, forests are distributed in 1029 patches, indicating a high level of fragmentation. LD, indicating the spatial heterogeneity of landcover, was very high in the Nilgiri hills and low in the Tirunelveli hills. The spatial analysis helped to delineate homogenous large patches of evergreen forest, which can be adopted for appropriate conservation strategies. A total of 342 tree species belonging to 4490 stems were evaluated for phytosociology. Only of similarity in terms of species distribution was found across the hill ranges. Conjunctive analysis of patch characteristics and species distribution showed high species richness in less fragmented evergreen forests and vice versa.

Considerable differences were observed in the FSR between different microhabitats with maximum values observed in bed rock and pool riffle and the lowest in regimes followed by step pools. Diversity and species richness decreased with increasing altitude and higher diversity and species richness were observed in sampling sites located between above sea level.

This study in a biodiversity hotspot and endemic bird area, the Western Ghats mountains of India, examined the effects of habitat structure, floristics, and adjacent habitats on bird communities in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and tropical rainforest fragments. Habitat and birds were sampled in 13 sites: six fragments (three relatively isolated and three with canopy connectivity with adjoining shade-coffee plantations and forests), six plantations differing in canopy tree species composition (five coffee and one cardamom), and one undisturbed primary rainforest control site in the Anamalai hills. Around 3300 detections of 6000 individual birds belonging to 106 species were obtained. The coffee plantations were poorer than rainforest in rainforest bird species, particularly endemic species, but the rustic cardamom plantation with diverse, native rainforest shade trees, had bird species richness and abundance comparable to primary rainforest. Plantations and fragments that adjoined habitats providing greater tree canopy connectivity supported more rainforest and fewer open-forest bird species and individuals than sites that lacked such connectivity. These effects were mediated by strong positive effects of vegetation structure, particularly woody plant variables, cane, and bamboo, on bird community structure. Bird community composition was however positively correlated only to floristic (tree species) composition of sites. The maintenance or restoration of habitat structure and (shade) tree species composition in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and rainforest fragments can aid in rainforest bird conservation in the regional landscape.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Conservation initiatives are designed to address threats to forests and biodiversity, often through partnerships with natural-resource users who are incentivized to change their land-use and livelihood practices to avoid further biodiversity loss. In particular, direct incentives programmes that provide monetary benefits are commended for being effective in achieving conservation across short timescales. In biodiversity-rich areas, outside protected areas, such as coffee agroforestry systems, direct incentives, such as certification schemes, are used to motivate coffee producers to maintain native tree species, natural vegetation, restrict wildlife hunting, and conserve soil and water, in addition to encouraging welfare of workers. However, despite these claims, there is a lack of strong evidence of the on-ground impact of such schemes. To assess the conservation importance of certification, we describe a case study in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot of India, in which coffee growers are provided price incentives to adopt Rainforest Alliance certification standards. We analyse the conservation and social outcomes of this programme by studying experiences of participating in certification. Despite high compliance and effective implementation, we find a strong case for the endorsement of as with no changes in farm management as a result of certification. We find that such as participation in certification creates grounds for diminishing credibility and local support for conservation efforts.

The forest edges are affected by anthropogenic activities including deforestation, forest fragmentation, selective logging, extraction of non-timber forest products, collection of medicinal plants, recreations, hydroelectric projects and its associated developmental activities, which alter the biodiversity. The present study intends to evaluate the edge effect on vegetation structure and species compositions in the tropical forest ecosystems at Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary in the Western Ghats. High species richness (number of species) and diversity indices were observed in the site III (completely undisturbed forest) compared to site I (adjacent to the village/ edge of the forest, which is next to the teak plantation, severely disturbed forest) and site II (in between the undisturbed forest and moderately disturbed forest) while density of tree species showed greater value in site II. Single species such as Tectona grandis (IVI of 80) and Terminalia paniculata (IVI of 112) were the dominant tree species in site I and site II, respectively, whereas, in site III Terminalia bellirica, Bishofia javanica and Syzgium gardneri shared the dominance. Perturbation leads to alien plant invasion particularly Lantana camara, Eupatorium odoratum and Ageratum conizoides. Site II is at forest transition level because the site is dominated by both natural species as well as plantation species such as Tectona grandis. This site seems to be a buffer zone on natural forest and plantations.

In this study, we show that forest fragmentation provokes surprisingly rapid and profound alterations in tropical tree community. We examine forest fragments in the tropical region using high-resolution satellite imagery taken between 1973 and 2004 in the Southern Western Ghats (India) in relation to landscape patterns and phytosociological datasets. We have distinguished fragmentation in six perforated, edge, transitional, patch, and each forested pixel. Furthermore, we have characterized each of the fragment class in the evergreen and semi-evergreen forest in terms of its species composition and richness, its species similarity and abundance, and its regeneration status. Different landscape metrics have been used to infer patterns of land-use changes. Contiguous patches of covered 90% of evergreen forest in 1973 with less porosity and minimal plantation and anthropogenic pressures; whereas in 2004, the area had 67% forest coverage and a high level of porosity, possibly due to Ochlandra spread and increased plantations which resulted in the loss of such contiguous patches. Results highlight the importance of landscape metrics in monitoring land-cover change over time. Our main conclusion was to develop an approach, which combines information regarding land cover, degree of fragmentation, and phytosociological inputs, to conserve and prioritize tropical ecosystems.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Agroforestry in the Western Ghats (WG) of peninsular India and satoyama in rural Japan are traditional land-use systems with similar evolutionary trajectories.

While agroforestry involves key productive and protective functions, and adopts the satoyama woodlands are extensively managed; understorey production is seldom a consideration. Differences in canopy architecture (multi-tiered structure of agroforestry vs. the more or less unitary canopy of satoayama) and land ownership pattern (privately owned/managed agroforestry holdings vs. community or local government or privately owned and mostly abandoned satoyamas) pose other challenges in the transfer and application of knowledge gained in one system to the other.

However, because protected areas are often targeted for the conservation of selected species, particularly charismatic animals, concerns have been raised about their effectiveness in conserving nontarget taxa and their genetic resources. In this paper, we evaluate whether protected areas can serve as refugia for genetic resources of economically important plants that are threatened due to extraction pressures. We examine the population structure and genetic diversity of an economically important rattan, Calamus thwaitesii, in the core, buffer and peripheral regions of three protected areas in the central Western Ghats, southern India. Our results indicate that in all the three protected areas, the core and buffer regions maintain a better population structure, as well as higher genetic diversity, than the peripheral regions of the protected area. Thus, despite the escalating pressures of extraction, the protected areas are effective in conserving the genetic resources of rattan. These results underscore the importance of protected areas in conservation of nontarget species and emphasize the need to further strengthen the protected-area network to offer refugia for economically important plant species.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Fragmentation leads to the loss of connectivity among forested landscapes, which is important for biological conservation and biodiversity maintenance.

Similar matrices were also developed for altitudinal difference and geographic distance between sites. A total of 30 species in four families were recorded from 3681 individuals. The hill ranges differed significantly in the composition of the stream community at both the species and family levels. Within the hill range, species turnover was correlated with altitudinal difference and not with geographic distance. Anamalai Hills had a greater species turnover than Ashambu Hills, both within and between drainage. There was also a high turnover between these two hill ranges, with only two shared species. This turnover explains the fact that only species have been reported from different hill ranges, although regional diversity is high with about 130 species. The turnover also predicts that several undetected species should occur in hill ranges and drainage that have not been surveyed.

The tree species were sampled using belt transects at 5 km intervals and the regeneration status of endemic species assessed using quadrats. A total of 128 species belonging to 47 families, and representing 1,590 individuals, was observed. Amongst them, 65% of unique species were exclusive to sacred landscapes. A rarefaction plot confirmed higher species richness for the sacred compared to the agro ecosystem landscapes, and diversity indices with more evenness in distribution were evident in sacred landscapes. A significant loss of endemic tree species in the agro ecosystem landscapes was found. Overall, this study demonstrates that an intense biotic pressure in terms of plantations and other anthropogenic activities have altered the species composition of the riparian zone in non-sacred areas.

We assessed mammal diversity within coffee agroforestry systems in Kodagu, India and investigated the impacts of the non-native shade tree species, Grevillea robusta, on mammal diversity. Twenty farms, with varying amounts of G. robusta planted within the coffee farm, were sampled throughout three rainfall zones during the 4-month study period. We captured six species of small mammals, with indirect methods yielding an additional five species, totaling species. Contrary to current ecological thought, we found that increased amounts of G. robusta did not have a negative impact on either abundance or richness of mammals. Small mammal abundances were higher at farms with greater amounts of herbaceous ground cover and larger, mature shade trees, while small mammal species richness was found to increase with an increase in tree species richness as well as greater amounts of herbaceous ground cover. Additionally, small mammal abundance was higher at coffee farms closer to forested areas. Based on these findings, we suggest the maintenance or cultivation of shade tree richness, mature shade trees, and herbaceous ground cover within coffee farms and preservation of forested areas within the landscape to enhance coffee agroforestry habitat for non-volant mammals. We hope that these habitat requirements will be incorporated into conservation strategies for the promotion of biodiversity within coffee agroforestry systems.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The composition, abundance, population structure and distribution patterns of all woody species 30 cm gbh) were investigated in an undisturbed and two adjacent human-impacted sites of a tropical wet evergreen forest in Kalakad National Park, Western Ghats, south India.

Exotic species dominated the tree diversity in lands where the tree harvesting rights are with the growers. Native trees dominated the tree diversity when growers had no ownership rights on trees. A species accumulation curve suggested that the sacred grove had higher species richness compared to other two habitats.

Western Ghats in southern India have gained attention due to high tropical biodiversity and endemism in their southern most area. We attempted to track the affinities of the pollen flora of the endemic plants of Western Ghat area within the fossil palynoflora of late Palaeocene-early Eocene Ma) sedimentary deposits of western and northeastern Indian region. The study shows striking similarity of extant pollen with twenty eight most common fossil pollen taxa of the early Palaeogene. Widespread occurrences of coal and lignite deposits during early Palaeogene provide evidence of existence of well diversified rain forest community and swampy vegetation in the coastal low lying areas all along the western and northeastern margins of the Indian subcontinent. Prevalence of excessive humid climate during this period has been seen as a result of equatorial positioning of Indian subcontinent, superimposed by a long term global warming phase (PETM and EECO) during the early Palaeogene. The study presents clear evidence that highly diversified equatorial rain forest vegetation once widespread in the Indian subcontinent during early Palaeogene times, are now restricted in a small area as a refugia in the southernmost part of the Western Ghat area. High precipitation and shorter periods of dry months seem to have provided suitable environment to sustain lineages of ancient tropical vegetation in this area of Western Ghats in spite of dramatic climatic changes subsequent to the post India-Asia collision and during the Quaternary and Recent times.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Changes in tree and understory plant diversity and community composition in two sites at different disturbance levels were studied on the Anaikatty hills, Western Ghats.

Among the two sites, species richness and diversity were highest for low disturbed stand (98 and 3.9, respectively) compared to high disturbed site (45 and 2.71, respectively). Result of cluster analysis showed that two distinct clusters were formed on the basis of disturbance of the area in concordance with our field observation. A total of 37 species were common to both sites, sixty one species exclusively found in low disturbed site and eight species were pertained to highly disturbed site. test based on Monte Carlo approximation at 95% confidence levels indicated that both populations were not entirely different. The clear difference was only observed for average basal area of trees, density of seedlings, number of species, density and diversity for shrubs and number of species and diversity for herb. The species composition were different in two stand i.e., Nothopegia neilghrrensis in low disturbed stand and Albizia racemosa in high disturbed stand. The major disturbance factors identification using spearman rank correlation indicated that the disturbance in low disturbed habitats were mostly from past logging followed by cutting and illicit felling and grazing, while in high disturbed habitats, it was human presence, past logging and lopping and fuel wood collection.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'While the conservation impacts of invasive plant species on tropical biodiversity is widely recognised, little is known of the potential for cultivated crops turning invasive in tropical forest regions. In the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, India, fragmented rainforests often adjoin coffee plantations. This study in the Anamalai hills assessed the effects of distance from edges and forest structure on the occurrence and abundance of shade-tolerant coffee (Arabica Coffea arabica and Robusta C. canephora) in four fragments using replicate line transects laid from the edges into the interiors. The coffee species cultivated in adjoining plantations was more abundant than the other coffee species inside study fragments, showing a clear decline in stem density from edge to interior suggesting the influence of propagule pressure of adjoining plantations, coupled with edge effects and seed dispersal by animals. Significant positive correlations of coffee density with canopy cover indicate the potential threat of coffee invasion even in closed canopy rainforests. Stem density of Coffea arabica was higher in more disturbed fragments, whereas Coffea canephora had spread in disturbed and undisturbed sites achieving much higher densities In addition, a negative relationship between C. canephora and native shrub density indicates its potential detrimental effects on native plants.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The main objective of this study is to integrate satellite derived forest burnt areas over a multi-decadal scale to understand fire frequencies in Silent Valley National Park, Kerala, India.

A biologically rich Tiger Reserve, located at Southern Western Ghats, India, was chosen for this study. In order to spatially delineate areas of high species richness/diversity and endemic habitat zones, we have identified evergreen habitats in conjunction with landscape metrics, species assemblage, micro-habitats like slope, topography, species endemism, and proportion of core and edge species. A total of 236 species and 2,920 individuals were recorded using systematic stratified plots of covering 47 plots. Hierarchical cluster analysis was done using method. Plot information was used to identify clusters based on species density. The analysis showed five species assemblages that are quite distinct from each other in terms of dominant species. The distribution of endemic and edge species, land cover heterogeneity, and continuity of patches in these clusters were evaluated to understand the degree of disturbance and intactness at landscape scale. Integration of species assemblages and topography brought out four major elevation-slope complexes. Information on species composition (robust field survey) with spectral (hybrid classification) properties has shown 72% overall accuracy and distinguished four evergreen sub-groups and other land cover classes.

In this study, inter-simple sequence repeat markers were used to investigate the genetic variation and population structure of seven extant populations of C. fenestratum from the central Western Ghats, India. Eight primer combination produced a total of 57 unambiguous bands, of which were polymorphic. The species exhibited a moderate to low level of intra population genetic diversity (H H (POPGENE) and H H (HICKORY)). The populations were low to moderately differentiated from one another (G and geographical distance was not significantly correlated with genetic distance, suggesting that these long-lived, geographically distant remnant populations were once connected through gene flow. There was a significant amount of genetic variation among populations The Bayesian software STRUCTURE and HICKORY were used to further reveal the genetic structure of C. fenestratum. The results revealed weak population structure with one single widespread gene pool, and indicated that gene flow and inbreeding are likely to be the major driving force in shaping current population genetic structure of C. fenestratum.

To better understand the relationship between amphibians and cardamom, a study was undertaken at these plantations, which harbor numerous threatened and range-restricted amphibians. We undertook questionnaire surveys with 298 respondents at 148 plantations across southern India. Time-activity budget and diet analysis surveys were undertaken to determine whether amphibians really consumed cardamom. The conception that amphibians eat cardamom was found to be widespread especially among small-sized plantations, leading to negative perceptions and a lack of interest in amphibian conservation. The plantation community perceives a substantial economic loss due to amphibians, even though this is non-existent as revealed by our field surveys. These perceptions would lead to a continued intolerance of amphibian presence in plantations. A suitable outreach initiative re-affirming facts and spreading awareness on the positive role of amphibians would need to be conducted to negate this age-old myth.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Rural people in developing countries including India continue to access a number of types of to meet specific needs such as fuelwood, fodder, food, non-timber forest produce and timber for both subsistence and income generation. While a plethora of terms exist to describe the types of forests that rural people as farm forests, social forests, community forests and small-scale expression domestic forest has recently been proposed. Domestic forest is a term aimed at capturing the diversity of forests transformed and managed by rural communities and a way to introduce a new scientific domain that recognises that production and conservation can be reconciled and that local communities can be effective managers. This paper argues in the context of the central Western Ghats of south India that while the domestic forest concept is a useful umbrella term to capture the diversity of forests used by rural people, these domestic forests are often not autonomous local forests but sites of contestation between local actors and the state forest bureaucracy. Hence, a paradigm shift within the forest bureaucracy will only occur if the scientific forestry community questions its own normative views on forest management and sees forest policy as a means to recognise local claims and support existing practices of forest dependent communities.'\"], [\"Abstract: ' Summary.

Path analysis and spatial multiple regression analysis are employed to measure the relative impacts of different climatic variables on the richness of tree species. Four climatic predictors, annual mean temperature (TEM), annual mean precipitation (PREC), annual evapotranspiration (AET), and elevation range (TOPO), are used to represent different perspectives of climatic variability. TEM represents temperature tolerance, PREC water availability, AET energy and TOPO habitat heterogeneity. Results show that, without removing spatial autocorrelation, AET is the most influential variable. However, the effect of AET was detected to be an artifact of spatial autocorrelation and after controlling such a misleading effect using simultaneous autoregressive models, the effects of other variables became evident and important in explaining the richness of endemic trees. All the statistical models consistently identified that TOPO and PREC are the equally influential variables for structuring richness patterns of endemic trees in Western Ghats.

We assessed the nature and distribution of genetic variation among 11 populations ofO. malampuzhaensis using random amplified polymorphic DNA markers. The analysis revealed low genetic variation inO. malampuzhaensis. Cluster analysis of pairwise genetic distances of populations revealed three distinct clusters and the grouping of populations largely corresponded to their geographical proximity. Restricted gene flow and a geography-dependent differentiation were evident among populations. The altitude-influenced differences in ecological factors among the natural habitats of the populations seem to be the cause of the geography-dependent differentiation. Genetically isolated smaller populations and a narrow genetic base inO. malampuzhaensis point to its vulnerability to genetic drift and genetic depauperation. ThusO. malampuzhaensis appears to be under the threat of extinction and needs to be conserved by use of suitable methods.

Wild edible fruits were rich in minerals, vitamins, carbohydrates, proteins, fats and fiber. In recent years there has been a decline in numbers of wild fruit trees due to changes in land use from uncultivated private wooded area to cardamom and coffee cultivation.

When genetic variation was compared between seedlings and adults across locations, significant differences were detected in allelic richness, observed heterozygosity, fixation index (F IS), and relatedness Reduced genetic diversity and increased relatedness at the seedling stage might be due to fragmentation and disturbance. There was no FSGS at the adult stage and FSGS was limited to shorter distance classes at the seedling stage.

A comparison of the distributions of size classes in the four locations with published data from a more southern area, showed that large trees (diameter at breast height, DBH, are present in the southern sacred forests but not in the northern forest reserves.

A morphometric analysis was carried out to evaluate the drainage characteristics of two adjoining, mountain river basins of the southern Western Ghats, India, Muthirapuzha River Basin (MRB) in the western slopes and Pambar River Basin (PRB) in the eastern slopes. The basins, forming a part of the Proterozoic, high-grade, Southern Granulite Terrain of the Peninsular India, are carved out of a terrain dominantly made of granite- and hornblende-biotite gneisses. The Western Ghats, forming the basin divide, significantly influences the regional climate (i.e., humid climate in MRB, while semi-arid in PRB). The Survey of India topographic maps (1:50,000) and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission digital elevation data were used as the base for delineation and analysis. Both river basins are of 6th order and comparable in basin geometry. The drainage patterns and linear alignment of the drainage networks suggest the influence of structural elements. The Rb of either basins failed to highlight the structural controls on drainage organization, which might be a result of the elongated basin shape. The irregular trends in Rb between various stream orders suggest the influence of geology and relief on drainage branching. The Dd values designate the basins as moderate- to well-drained with lower infiltration rates. The overall increasing trend of Rl between successive stream orders suggests a geomorphic maturity of either basins and confirmed by the characteristic I hyp values. The Re values imply an elongate shape for both MRB and PRB and subsequently lower vulnerability to flash floods and hence, easier flood management. The relatively higher Rr of PRB is an indicative of comparatively steeply sloping terrain and consequently higher intensity of erosion processes. Further, the derivatives of digital elevation data (slope, aspect, topographic wetness index, and stream power index), showing significant differences between MRB and PRB, are useful in soil conservation plans.

This confirms the morphological examinations, as Hypocrea is the teleomorph stage of Trichoderma sp. This study signifies the first work pertaining to the taxonomy of the fungal endophytic community of D. arayalpathra, and the results reported in this work may help to ascertain the cause of root rot disease often perceived in D. arayalpathra. Also, it could be useful to identify the promising endophytic communities against the root rot diseases occurring in D. arayalpathra.'\"], [\"Abstract: ' Vateria indica is a critically-endangered and economically-important tree endemic to the Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot in India. Due to extreme local endemism and anthropogenic destructive harvesting of resin, the species is categorized as critically endangered. The present study investigated the biotic limiting factors of recruitment of V. inidica in its natural populations, and studied the pattern of anthropogenic harvest of nuts of V. indica in the recent past. Seed predation and seedling herbivory particularly by insects were assessed. The sustainability of the nut harvest was assessed by conducting pre- and post-harvest censuses of nuts on forest floors. Over of the fruits of V. indica were infested by the insects, but, only about of the infested fruits were seed-predated. Seedling herbivores included a leaf miner, ants of two species, and larvae of a lymantrid moth. Seedling mortality due to herbivores was moderate Pre- and post-harvest censuses showed that only of the fruits that were naturally-fallen on the forest floor were spared after the harvest had taken place. Sringeri has exported 820 metric tons of nuts in the study year, which was an all-time high estimate. The study concludes that the anthropogenic nut collection can hamper the population structure of V. indica locally. Since V. indica has an alternate-year major flowering cycle, the seed loss as seen in the present study is critical. Raising plantations of V. indica as an afforestation program can contribute to the conservation of the species and the development of local communities.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The objective of the present work is to study the chemical variation in Calophyllum inophyllum growing along the Western Ghats of India.

The single-minded pursuit of the development of the water resources of the rivers of the Western Ghats shows many examples of this view, particularly in the unnecessary destruction of the dwindling forest resources. This destruction may be caused by (i) problems o f rehabilitation, e.g. the Ramanagar settlement of the Kalinadi project (ii) the impact of labourers, e.g. the destruction of evergreen sholas on the Upper Nilgiri plateau (iii) the access to encroachers and poachers, e.g. Panshet and Kalinadi (iv) faulty planning, e.g. Linganamakki and Kalinadi. This destruction of forest cover has had a number of deleterious consequences in (i) worsening the shortages of forest resources, (ii) hastening the siltation of the reservoirs, (iii) ecological imbalances as in the rapid spread ofEupatorium in the Kalinadi project area and (iv) the decimation of biological diversity, as in the great reduction of evergreen forests in the Western Ghats, threatening the survival of lion-tailed macaque and the extinction of grass species,Hubbardia heptaneuron. It is stressed that the only sustainable and therefore true development is environmentally sound development. The interests of the weaker sections of the society often provide a good index of the soundness of the development from an environmental point of view. The planning of the development process with this perspective is a great scientific and technological challenge that must be taken up.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Herbaceous vascular epiphytes were screened in a total sample of 13 445 trees (in 153 species) and 348 lianas (in 30 species) cm girth at breast height in a 30 ha plot of tropical evergreen forest at Varagalaiar, Indian Western Ghats. Of these, 4.3% of trees and 3.7% of lianas were infested with epiphytes. Epiphyte diversity totaled 26 species in 19 genera and 10 families. Sixteen species were angiosperms in three families (Orchidaceae 54%; Piperaceae and Araceae 8%) and 10 species (38%) were pteridophytes in seven families. The orchid, Pholidota pallida was most abundant and occurred on 178 (29.6%) stems. Asplenium nidus occurred on the maximum of 62 host species.

(Black Pepper), one of the highly valued spice crops is reported to be from India. Black pepper is naturally distributed in India in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot and is the only known existing source of its wild germplasm in the world. We used ecological niche models to predict the potential distribution of wild P. nigrum in the present and two future climate change scenarios viz (A1B) and (A2A) for the year 2080. Three topographic and nine uncorrelated bioclim variables were used to develop the niche models. The environmental variables influencing the distribution of wild P. nigrum across different climate change scenarios were identified. We also assessed the direction and magnitude of the niche centroid shift and the change in niche breadth to estimate the impact of projected climate change on the distribution of P. nigrum. The study shows a niche centroid shift in the future climate scenarios. Both the projected future climate scenarios predicted a reduction in the habitat of P. nigrum in Southern Western Ghats, which harbors many wild accessions of P. nigrum. Our results highlight the impact of future climate change on P. nigrum and provide useful information for designing sound germplasm conservation strategies for P. nigrum.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Plants diversity and phenological pattern of the trees were monitored in a montane wet temperate forest (shola) in the Kukkal Forest, Palni hills of the southern Western Ghats, India. Twelve random plots were selected for sampling the vegetation. For phenological studies, twenty-three fleshy fruit trees were identified in the study area and 10 individuals of each species were selected to record the phenological events fortnightly between April 2002 and April 2004. The phenological events were divided into vegetative and reproductive phases. A total of 2279 individuals were inventoried which belong to 83 species, 68 genera and 40 families. About 30% of the species were endemic to the Western Ghats. The most dominant species 1 cm dbh) was Psychotria nilgiriensis var. astephana (Rubiaceae), which accounted for 12% of the total sampled individuals. Lauraceae was the dominant family accounting for 20% of the individuals. Fruiting peak occurred in July 2003 and least in June 2002. During the peak period, fruits of 85 individuals of six species were observed. Syzygium tamilnadensis, Ilex wightiana and Beilschmiedia wightii fruited only once during the two years of study. The number of fruiting species showed no correlation with rainfall (r = 0.26, p = 0.2), while a correlation was found with fruit abundance (r = 0.40, p < 0.05).

Here, molecular methods were used for assessment of 246 barcodes belonging to 81 fish species from northern Western Ghats of India, using, Barcode gap analysis, barcode index number, automatic barcode gap discovery, Poisson tree processes and general mixed Yule-coalescent, these methods had their potential to discriminate 97.53%, 93.90% 95.06%, 93.82% and 92.59% of species respectively. But, some of them tended to estimate the inconsistent number of species leading to discrepancies between the morphological concept and inference from molecular phylogenetic reconstructions. So, we took a standard approach to recognize those methods that produced consistent results, three of five such methods were identified that revealed three hidden cryptic species complexes in Monopterus indicus, Parambassis ranga and Systomus sarana. Further, to validate these three genetically diverged species, we used diagnostic character based approach along with nine unidentified species through BLOG and WEKAs SMO classifier. Those methods were unable to identify these species, which might be due to the limited number of specimens used for the analysis. This is the first effort to generate the DNA barcode reference library of freshwater fishes from northern Western Ghats of India, one of the biodiversity hotspots.

We examined demographic parameters of 9 lion-tailed macaque groups in 8 rain forest fragments with reference to fragment area, tree density, canopy cover, tree height, and total basal area of food trees. Group size ranged from 7 to 90 individuals but was not related to habitat variables. Birth and growth rates of groups did not differ significantly between small and large fragments. Tree density, canopy cover, and total basal of food trees all show strong positive correlations with fragment area. Growth rate correlates with tree density, but there are no other significant relationships between birth or growth rate and habitat variables. The percentage of immature individuals in the group is significantly positively associated with the total basal area of food trees, but not with any other habitat variable. Comparison of our data from this study with data available for the same population in 1996 indicates a slight decline in birth rate but an increase in total number of individuals, from 154 to 242. Of the 5 small fragment groups, 3 have increased in size since 1996 while the sizes of the other 2 groups have remained the same. Based on this study, we advocate that to manage the fragile lion-tailed macaque groups the following steps need to be taken: 1) create dispersal corridors between the fragments using fruit trees to facilitate male dispersal, 2) construct canopy bridges across the prevailing roads, 3) protect the fragments from further degradation, and 4) periodically monitor these populations for long-term conservation.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Frogs in the genus Indirana are endemic to Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot.

However, land use changes continue to impact on assemblages of soil biota and the ecosystem services they provide. The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of land use intensification on the distribution and abundance of soil invertebrate communities in the Nilgiri, a human-dominated biosphere reserve of international importance. Soil invertebrates were sampled in 15 land use practices ranging from simple and intensively managed annual crop fields and monoculture tree plantations through less intensively managed agroforestry and pristine forest ecosystems. The lowest taxonomic richness was found in annual crops and coconut monoculture plantations, while the highest was in moist-deciduous and semi-evergreen forests. With 21 ant species, agroforestry systems had the highest diversity of ants followed by forest ecosystems (12 species). Earthworms and millipedes were significantly more abundant in agroforestry systems, plantations and forest ecosystems than in annual crop fields. Ants, termites, beetles, centipedes, crickets and spiders were more abundant in forest ecosystems than in other ecosystems. It is concluded that annual cropping systems have lower diversity and abundance of soil invertebrates than agroforestry and natural forest ecosystems. These results and the literature from other regions highlight the potential role that agroforestry practices can play in biodiversity conservation in an era of ever-increasing land use intensification and habitat loss.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Contrary to expectations, some human-modified landscapes are considered to sustain both human activities and biodiversity over the long-term. Agroforestry systems are among these landscapes where crops are planted under native shade trees. In this context, ancient agroforestry systems can provide insight into how farmers managed the landscape over time. Such insight can help to quantify the extent to which tropical forests (especially habitat-specialist trees) are responding to local and landscape-level management. Here, we extracted fossil pollen (indicator of past vegetation changes) and macroscopic charcoal (indicator of biomass burning) from four forest sedimentary sequences in an ancient agroforestry system in Western Ghats, India. We used a mixed-modelling approach and a principal components analysis (PCA) to determine past trajectories of forest change and species composition dynamics for the last In addition, we reconstructed the long-term forest canopy dynamics and examined the persistence of habitat-specialist trees over time. Our results show that the four sites diverged to a surprising degree in both taxa composition and dynamics.

Values for the Simpson diversity index ranged between 0.764 and 0.964, and for evenness index between 0.00 and 0.036 for neighbourhoods within populations. This myrmecophyte was found to combine sexual recruitment (66.7%) and clonal production (33.3%) as methods of reproduction. Moderate amounts of genetic diversity at the species level were observed, with 52.63% polymorphism, and moderate values of diversity index (0.1895) as well as of gene diversity (0.1186).

Some neighbourhoods within each population showed spatial genetic structure even at small spatial scales of <5 m. A combination of clonality and short-distance pollen movement by small pollinating bees (Braunsapis puangensis) coupled with primary ballistic seed dispersal, and possible secondary seed dispersal by rodents, may contribute to spatial genetic structure at such small scales.

Demographic characteristics, a consequence of life history traits, indicate the reproductive output per individual in group-living species. Both phylogenetic and ecological factors influence demographic traits.

S. hypoleucos and S. priam are genetically closer to each other than to S. johnii. We sampled a total of 193 groups of the three species of langurs. The group size was smaller in the two wet forest-dwelling species, S. johnii and S. hypoleucos (nine), than in the dry forest-dwelling species, S. priam (18). The number of adult females per group was higher in S. priam (seven) and S. johnii (six) than in S. hypoleucos (four). On the other hand, the adult female:immature ratio, indicating reproductive output and life history, was highest in S. johnii (1:0.33) followed by S. hypoleucos (1:1) and S. priam (1:1.09). Our results suggest that reproductive output is lowest in the arboreal wet forest species and increases as the species become somewhat dry deciduous forest dwellers, or almost facultative dry forest dwellers, and relatively more terrestrial.

Upstream--downstream trends in species richness and diversity as well as changes in stream characteristics were studied using univariate correlation analyses. Preliminary analyses on changes in species composition and feeding guilds showed the presence of a gradual species turnover along the stream gradient. There were associated changes in the major feeding guild compositions, with a higher proportion of insectivore and algivore/herbivore composition in the upper reaches shifting to a predominance of omnivores and carnivores downstream. product--moment correlation analyses along with stepwise multiple regression analyses identified stream depth and altitude as the important parameters determining species richness. Canonical correspondence analysis was performed to study species associations with environmental parameters. The analysis showed a strong species environmental correlation to the CCA axes, a high significance for the CCA axis 1 as well as for the overall test. The plots of the species and site scores on the CCA axes showed a clear segregation of species based on their relations with environmental and stream properties.

Forest fire regimes in a predominantly dry forest in India, the Nilgiri landscape, and a predominantly savanna ecosystem in the Sathyamangalam landscape, were examined. Remote sensing data were applied to delineate burned areas, determine fire size characteristics, and to estimate fire-rotation intervals. Belt transects (0.5 ha) were used to estimate forest structure, diversity, and fuel loads. Mean area burned, mean number of fires, and mean fire size per year were substantially higher in the Nilgiri landscape compared to the Sathyamangalam landscape. Mean fire-rotational interval was 7.1 yr in the Nilgiri landscape and 44.1 yr in the Sathyamangalam landscape. Tree cm diameter at breast height) species diversity, tree density, and basal area were significantly higher in the Nilgiri landscape compared to the Sathyamangalam landscape. Total fuel loads were significantly higher in tropical dry and moist deciduous forests in the Nilgiri landscape, but total fuel loads were higher in the tropical dry thorn forests of the Sathyamangalam landscape. Thus, the two landscapes revealed contrasting fire regimes and forest characteristics, with more and four-fold larger fires in the Nilgiri landscape. The dry forests and savannas could be maintained by a combination of factors, such as fire, grazing pressures, and herbivore populations. Understanding the factors maintaining these two ecosystems will be critical for their conservation.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The availability of refuges from predators and high quality food are thought to determine habitat use in small ungulates. We tested this hypothesis on habitat use by the Indian chevrotain in a tropical rainforest in the Western Ghats, using pellet-groups to infer habitat use. Between December 2009 and April 2010, we sampled 204 grids of with four spatial replicates in each, using occupancy framework. We quantified refuges such as fallen logs and boulders, understorey complexity, and noted the presence of fruiting trees in the grid. Detection probability, p, of pellet-groups was estimated at 0.61. The naive estimate of occupancy was 0.52, which increased to 0.73 when p was accounted for. Out of eight candidate models compared using AICC, the one with the number of refuges and understorey complexity was the best model. Both covariates had non-zero positive slopes. Fruiting trees occurred very infrequently and did not influence habitat use, perhaps because the chevrotain fed more on buds, shoots and young leaves during the dry period covered by this study. The strong influence of understorey complexity on habitat use was perhaps also due to the abundance of these food items. These results highlight the need to control human use that adversely impacts the availability of refuges and understorey complexity such as removal of fallen logs and rattans. This study also demonstrates the application of the occupancy approach in the study of small and elusive ungulates.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'A long-standing view of Indian biodiversity is that while rich in species, there are few endemics or in-situ radiations within the subcontinent.

Based on this premise, endophytes have been regarded as a focal group for estimating fungal numbers because their possible hyperdiverse nature would reflect significantly global fungal diversity. We present our consolidated ten-year work on 75 dicotyledonous tree hosts belonging to 33 families and growing in three different types of tropical forests of the NBR in the Western Ghats, southern India. We conclude that endophyte diversity in these forests is limited due to loose host affiliations among endophytes. Some endophytes have a wide host range and colonize taxonomically disparate hosts suggesting adaptations in them to counter a variety of defense chemicals in their hosts. Furthermore, such polyphagous endophytes dominate the endophyte assemblages of different tree hosts. Individual leaves may be densely colonized but only by a few endophyte species. It appears that the environment (the type of forest in this case) has a larger role in determining the endophyte assemblage of a plant host than the taxonomy of the host plant. Thus, different tropical plant communities have to be studied for their endophyte diversity to test the generalization that endophytes are hyperdiverse in the tropics, estimate their true species richness, and use them as a predictor group for more accurate assessment of global fungal diversity.'\"], [\"seeds and axenic seedling-derived rhizomes'\"], [\"Abstract: 'An efficient protocol has been devised for the propagation and field establishment of Eulophia cullenii (Wight) Bl., a terrestrial orchid having ornamental potentialities, and is critically endangered in Western Ghats, India. Seeds extracted from capsules germinated in MS, MS, Knudson C, or Mitra liquid medium developed into protocorms in Supplementation of organic additives like coconut water, peptone, yeast extract, and casein acid hydrolysate (CH) significantly enhanced protocorm growth. Upon subculture onto agar-gelled Mitra medium fortified with 0.05% CH, 56% of protocorms regenerated into shoots through the formation of linear mini-rhizomes. The regenerated shoots grew vigorously in MS, producing new rhizomes. Mature rhizomes from axenic seedlings produced maximum shoots/whole rhizome in MS fortified with 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), in Horizontal and longitudinal halves of the rhizome also gave multiple shoots in the presence of BAP. Shoots or shoot clumps sub-cultured onto MS basal medium produced roots followed by rhizomes in Seedlings with mature rhizomes showed 70% establishment in the nursery and added a new rhizome at the end of one growth cycle. An average of 70.6% of the rhizomes originating from seedlings during the second growth cycle sprouted to produce new shoots, when planted in the native localities. Asymbiotic germination and cloning through rhizomes thus can provide a large number of vigorous plants of E. cullenii for ornamental exploitation as well as eco-restoration, if rhizome as storage organ is ensured in the propagule.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Macro and microhabitat analyses were applied to characterise the fish assemblage structure in 10 streams of the Western Ghat mountains of Peninsular India. Macrohabitat features, such as channel gradient, stream depth, stream width, riparian cover, instream cover, habitat types and substrates, were used. Microhabitat requirements of the abundant cyprinids (35 species) were also analysed. Macrohabitat assessment indicated that a high habitat diversity was associated with a high species diversity, and that habitat volume was a major determining factor for species diversity and abundance. In all streams, cyprinids were the dominant group in the assemblage and almost all cyprinids were confined to pools with a varied habitat diversity. Riffle dwelling species included ancient forms such as Glyptothorax madraspatnum, G. trewasae and Homaloptera santhamparaiensis. Suitable microhabitats for dominant cyprinid species were pools and riffle edges. Big-sized barbs and mahseers such as Hypselobarbus dobsoni, H. curmuca, H. dubius, Labeo calbasu, Puntius sarana, Tor khudree and Tor khudree malabaricus were confined to deep pools with a large area. Smaller Puntius species like P. fasciatus, P. melanampyx, P. narayani, P. sophore, P. ticto and P. vittatus lived in shallow backwater pools and pools with low flow. Species like P. arulius tambiraparniei, P. amphibius, P. bimaculatus and P. filamentosus were found towards shallow pools with moderate flow. Surface-dwelling species such as Danio aequipinnatus, Rasbora daniconius, Salmostoma spp. and Barilius spp. preferred deepwater habitats with high flow.

After further drying to MC 21% germination was reduced to 16%. Complete loss in viability resulted when seed moisture was reduced to 18%. The seeds stored at and (open lab condition) lost their viability within 10 days. Seeds stored in sealed polythene bags and moist sand retained viability for more days than did seeds stored under all other storage conditions.

The mechanism behind these relationships are poorly understood due to the lack of insights into the interacting local factors and insufficient baseline data in ecological parasitology of wildlife. Here, we studied the gastrointestinal parasites of nonhuman mammalian hosts living in 10 rainforest patches of the Anamalai Tiger Reserve, India. We examined 349 faecal samples of 17 mammalian species and successfully identified 24 gastrointestinal parasite taxa including 1 protozoan, 2 trematode, 3 cestode and 18 nematode taxa. Twenty of these parasites are known parasites of humans. We also found that as much as 73% of all infected samples were infected by multiple parasites. In addition, the smallest and most fragmented forest patches recorded the highest parasite richness; the pattern across fragments, however, seemed to be less straightforward, suggesting potential interplay of local factors.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Phenological studies help to analyze resource abundance and feeding ecology of some herbivorous primate species. The rainforest between the rivers Aghnashini and Sharavathy in Karnataka, India, is one of the richest primate habitats in the country.

More than 800 trees of 71 species were considered for phenology sampling, and the tree species used by primates for consumption of leaves, flowers and fruits were selected for availability monitoring. Flush leaves were available throughout the year. The availability of mature leaves and flowers was highest in pre-summer Unripe and ripe fruits were mostly available in summer The availability of these resources showed significant seasonal variation.

Four 2-ha contiguous permanent plots were erected, one each in Perumakkai shola (site PS), Vengodai shola (VS), Kuzhivalavu shola (KS) and Mottukkadu shola (MS) at 1000, 1050, 1200 and 1250 m elevation, with increasing human disturbance, to evaluate the difference in tree species composition, stand structure and dynamics. This paper discusses the results of the first survey. A total of 3825 individuals and 78 species from 61 genera and 36 families were enumerated in the 8 ha area. Among the four 2-ha sites, species richness was greatest (58) in the undisturbed site PS and lowest (39) in the highly disturbed site MS. Shannon, Simpson, Hill diversity and evenness indexes revealed a progressive reduction in diversity with increasing disturbance. The asymptote species-area curves imply adequate site sampling. Tree density (1151 to 651 trees and basal area (106 to 46.6 m2 decreased from undisturbed to disturbed site, due to selective felling. Single species, Memecylon umbellatum dominated sites MS (39%) and VS (26%), while Nothopegia heyneana, Memecylon umbellatum and Diospyros ovalifolia were dominant in PS, and Meliosma simplicifolia, Myristica dactyloides and Phoebe wightii in KS. Based on species abundance, we classify the study area as association with Neolitsea and Myristica as codominants. Tree population structure revealed a step-wise decline in girth frequencies with increasing size class in undisturbed site PS, whereas tree density fell sharp (>50%) in medium girth class in the disturbed site MS. Population of the dominant species varied widely. The diversity values of this inventory are compared with similar studies in India and other tropical forests.

Spiders are one such group of invertebrate predators that are known to be sensitive indicators of environmental change in tropical ecosystems. The present study assesses the spider community structure and responses to rainforest fragmentation and degradation and conversion to shade-coffee plantations in the Anamalai hills, southern Western Ghats, India. Ten rainforest fragments ranging in size from to under varying levels of degradation within the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary and private lands of the Valparai plateau, and two shade-coffee plantation sites were sampled for spiders using visual searches along time-constrained belt transects between January and May 2005. Within a total sampled area of 4,565 individual spiders (4,300 detections) belonging to 156 morphospecies within 21 families and 8 functional groups were recorded. The estimated total number of understorey spider species in the study area was 192 species, representing around 13% of the total number of spider species so far described from India. Overall spider density, species richness, and species density showed no trend in relation to fragment area across all sites. Specific comparisons among undisturbed sites indicated however that high altitude sites had fewer species than mid-altitude sites and fragments had fewer species than relatively larger continuous forest sites. In contrast to the lack of trend in overall species richness and abundance, species composition changed substantially in relation to habitat alteration and altitude. Cluster analysis of Bray-Curtis similarities among sites in spider species composition revealed four distinct clusters: high altitude undisturbed sites, mid-altitude disturbed sites with an undisturbed mid altitude site, mid-altitude highly disturbed sites with a disturbed site, and shade-coffee plantation sites. Spider species, such as Psechrus torvus and Tylorida culta, that contributed significantly to the dissimilarity between undisturbed and disturbed rainforest sites, and rainforest and shade-coffee sites were identified that serve as useful indicators of habitat alteration.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Regulation of streamflow by a reservoir creates a flow regime much different from the pre-impoundment period flow regime. Hydro-Electric Projects (HEPs) commissioned in the Western Ghat regions of the Kerala State, India during the last four decades caused considerable changes in the flow regimes of the rivers of the Kerala State in southwest India. In this paper, the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) approach proposed by Richter et al. (1996) is used to analyze flow regime changes in the Periyar and Muvattupuzha Rivers, due to the construction of the Idukki (1976), Idamalayar (1987) and Lower Periyar (1997) HEPs in the high ranges of the Western Ghats. Normal rainfall years (annual rainfall values within mean 0.75 standard deviation limits) are only considered in the analysis to focus on hydrologic alterations due to human activities. The mean hydrologic alteration in the Periyar River (deviation from the pre-development hydrologic indicator values) after commissioning of three HEPs is 35%. Inter-basin water transfer after power generation from the Idukki HEP resulted in a higher discharge in the adjacent Muvattupuzha River, leading to considerable changes in the hydro-environment (mean hydrologic alterations varying between 57 to 63%). IHA parameters showing hydrologic alterations above the 67th Percentile were further analyzed. For each of the pre-construction hydrologic parameters 1 standard deviation from the mean is set as the upper and lower management target limits. The values of each IHA parameter beyond these targets are considered as non-attainment. Considerable hydrologic alterations are observed, especially for low flows in both basins. Inter-basin transfer induced larger changes in flow parameters compared to intra-basin regulations. The study shows that under a proper water release and diversion scheme, the non-attainment of IHA parameters (values fall beyond the target limits) can be reduced. The findings of the study will be greatly beneficial to regional water management and restoration of an eco-environmental system in the humid tropical region.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Vigna khandalensis (Santapau) Raghavan et Wadhwa, is an endemic legume belonging to subgenus Ceratotropis (Asian Vigna), genus Vigna of the family Fabaceae.

A quantitative assessment of ecosystem service is used here to evaluate the PAs of India in terms of storage and spatial distribution of carbon stocks. The area selected for the study was Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR), in the Southern Western Ghats, a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site. Carbon storage on a land parcel largely depends on the amount of five carbon pools: aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, dead wood, litter, and soil organic matter. The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model uses land cover types and data on the stocks in the five carbon pools to estimate the amount of carbon stored in a landscape. The InVEST model is multiservice and has a modular design that provides an effective tool for exploring the likely outcomes of alternative management and climate scenarios and for evaluating trade-offs among sectors and services.

This proposed ROC is based on: (1) multiple-resolutions, (2) soft classification, (3) sampling without replacement, and 4) explicit separation of factors of quantity versus location of land-use change. We illustrate the method with a case study in Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot, where we have maps of cumulative forest disturbance for 1920 and 1990. We use a predictive modeling approach similar to GEOMOD in which we calibrate the model with the map of 1920, then predict the map of 1990, at which point we subject the model to validation. We show that the fit of calibration tends to be much larger than the fit of validation.

Anurans exhibit a diverse array of parental care behaviors, but studies examining their adaptive significance in an evolutionary context are limited. The critically endangered bush frog, Raorchestes chalazodes (Rhacophoridae), only breeds inside hollow internodes of the endemic bamboo (Ochlandra travancorica) in the southern Western Ghats of India from June through October. From systematic surveys, we established that adult males are sole caregivers exhibiting egg attendance and egg guarding behavior. Predation was the main cause of egg mortality in the absence of an attending male; the majority of predation events were caused by conspecific males. The results highlight the role of regional and microhabitat-specific selection pressures such as strong seasonality, limited resources, and competition for oviposition sites. Oviposition sites are in high demand, but in short supply and by consuming unattended eggs, the conspecific male may benefit from nutritional gains as well as mating opportunities at the oviposition site.

Plants grown in the presence of AM fungi generally showed an increase in growth and biomass over those grown in the absence of AM fungal inoculation. It was observed that a consortium of AM fungi without organic manure was found to be the best treatment to enhance plant biomass.

The quantity and quality of fecal pellets differed between millipedes and their habitats (forest and plantation). Organic carbon content in manure was lower in plantations than in forests, while nitrogen content was elevated in plantations. The carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of manure was lower in plantations compared to forests. The phosphorus content in manure was elevated in plantations in all except for A. dalyi. Calcium content of manure was increased in plantations than in forests. The contents of magnesium, potassium and phenolics in manure showed varied results. The mass of fecal pellets was correlated only with volume in forests (r=0.882; p < 0.01) and pH in plantations (r=0.616; p < 0.05), while the volume of fecal pellets was correlated with nitrogen content in forests (r=0.751; p < 0.01) and calcium in plantations p < 0.05). The conductivity was positively correlated with phosphorus and potassium, while magnesium was negatively correlated in forests as well as plantations. Potassium and magnesium were negatively correlated in forests p < 0.001) and plantations (r=0.692; p < 0.05). Overall, the physicochemical characteristics and nutrient composition of fecal pelets differed between millipedes as well as habitats. The low carbon to nitrogen ratio and the increased nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium content in the manure of millipedes inhabiting in plantations indicates possibilities for successfully employing them for in situ composting of forest or plantation residues.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The Western Ghats (India) is a region of high biological diversity and endemicity of terrestrial fauna, but very little is known about its freshwater species distributions. Four rivers, Sharavati, Aghanashini, Bedti and Kali, of the central Western Ghats were studied for their fish diversity and composition. A total species richness of 92 species (and an endemicity of 25%) was reported. A comparison of expected species richness (SR) estimates using different statistical estimators was made these showed the expected SR to be in the range of species. Many of the species were found to be shared with those belonging to the southern Western Ghats, but the study also unearthed new findings in terms of description of a new species and extension of the known distribution range of some of the species. The study at varying spatial and temporal scales also showed that while the rivers are very similar to each other in terms of the SR values, they do vary with respect to the species composition. Species compositions across upper (or lower) reaches of these rivers were found to be more similar to one another than the upstream and downstream reaches in the same river. Temporal patterns, with regard to diurnal activity of fishes were studied. These showed that of the 72 species collected at night, 29 were exclusive to night sampling. Though much of the information of the feeding and habitat preferences of the fishes in this region is lacking, it is speculated that the differences in their activity patterns could be related to feeding and predator avoidance.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Diurnal periodicity of abundance (total, male and female) and behavior (resting, feeding and croaking) of the frogs Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis, E. hexadactylus and Hoplobatrachus tigerinus inhabiting in ponds of the Western Ghats at different altitudes (high, mid and foothill) have been investigated during three seasons (monsoon, post-monsoon and summer). Irrespective of seasons, the air and water temperatures were significantly lower during night than day in all locations and the humidity was significantly higher in high-altitude than other locations. Total abundance was significantly high only during night in mid-altitude inhabiting frog E. hexadactylus The resting behavior was significantly lower during night than day in all frogs, while it was opposite for croaking behavior. The feeding behavior was significantly higher during day than night in E. cyanophlyctis Total abundance was significantly correlated with abundance of females. Three hourly observations up to revealed consistently high total as well as female abundance during monsoon than other seasons. The resting and feeding behaviors of frogs gradually decreased from day towards night, while croaking behavior gradually increased from onwards and reached a peak at and decreased further.

Stridulation is a classical communication signal in males as well as females for mate selection. Conglobation (or volvation) is a mechanism of defence to protect from disturbance or avoid predation. If male touches female or vice versa they conglobate. To avoid disparity among individuals of the same species, volvating pill-millipedes evolved stridulation behaviour for communication. The male broadcasts appropriate signal to female through stridulation to advertise its interest in mating. The females test the fitness by conglobation and suitable male uncoils the partner through stridulation signals. Male with its pygidium successfully uncoils the female and attains suitable orientation for courtship. Male pairs with female contact in opposite direction to deposit sperm into the vulva of female. The duration of mating varies from species to species and usually a lapse from 3 to Vibration generated by stridulation is species-specific and its perception mechanism in pill-millipedes is yet to be clearly understood. Present study emphasized the structure of stridulatory organs, mechanism of stridulation and pattern of mating behaviour in four species of pill-millipedes.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The changes in species composition, abundance and forest stand structure were analyzed across altitudinal regimes in tropical forests of Eastern Ghats of northern Andhra Pradesh, India. Three 1-ha plots were established with one each in low, medium and high altitudes. A total of 153 species, 2129 stems (709 stems of cm girth were enumerated. Species richness and diversity pattern varied along altitudinal gradient and increased with the altitude. Species richness varied from 52 to 110 and stand density from 639 to 836 with average basal area of 34.39 Shannon-Wiener index ranged from 4.55 to 5.17.

In this study we report the patterns of discovery of eight taxa birds, butterflies, frogs, tiger beetles, grasses, asters, ferns and orchids in the Western Ghats, a megadiversity centre in India. Our results indicate that the discovery curves for birds and butterflies have been saturated while those for frogs and grasses continue to increase. Within each taxon, the major drivers of discovery were commonness of the species and their size. The average years taken for discovery across taxa were directly related to the per cent endemicity and species richness of the taxa. We discuss the trajectories of discovery with respect to rarity or endemicity of the species and life history features, and the implications these might have for strategizing the discovery process in India.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Caecilians are legless amphibians quite characteristic of the Western Ghats. Fourteen out of 16 Indian species occur in the Western Ghats and all are endemic. The present paper deals with the biology of caecilians with reference to external morphology and general breeding behaviour. It consolidates information on 26 morphological parameters which are used in caecilian identification. Metric multidimensional scaling of 16 species of caecilians using pair-wise euclidian distances calculated on the basis of 11 important morphometric parameters clearly depicts morphological distances between different species and more so the genera, thereby validating the classification. A field guide has been developed for the identification of caecilians based on a survey made all over the Western Ghats, observation of holotypes at the Natural History Museum, London and review of the literature. The study also reveals the microhabitat requirements of the caecilians. Further, the localities of caecilian distribution in the Western Ghats are mapped.

The present study compared the changes in soil biological and microbiological attributes along with coffee quality under different levels of shade and elevation for coffee in India. Significantly higher bulk density was observed in low elevation with open patch/no shade (LEOP) as compared to high elevation with thick shade (HETS). Low elevation with thick shade (LETS) recorded significantly higher water holding capacity as compared to high elevation with open patch (HEOP) Significantly higher organic carbon was observed in samples from shaded area as compared to no shade As compared to low elevation, higher available nitrogen available phosphorus and exchangeable potassium content was found to be significantly higher in samples of high elevation. Significantly higher soil respiration rate and urease activity was observed in the treatment LEOP, whereas higher dehydrogenase and fluorescein diacetate activity were indicated in HETS and HEOP treatments respectively. High elevation with thick or no shade treatments indicated significantly higher soil micro and macro-fauna population as compared to low elevation with thick or no shade. Significantly higher microbial population was recorded in HETS followed by LETS, whereas Shannon diversity index dominance index (D), and Shannon evenness (SE) were found to be similar for HETS, HEOP, and LETS treatments.

We analyzed the distribution of plant species with respect to the satellite derived vegetation indices. The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer derived vegetation products, i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), leaf area index (LAI), and surface reflectance (SR-645nm and SR-858nm) were fitted to suitable regression curves with respect to plant species richness where NDVI demonstrated the best fit while fPAR showed better relation with woody species richness. We observed positive but weak correlation for all the biophysiological proxies with species richness in the forests of Western Ghats. The annual pattern of correlation faired than seasonal (i.e., post-monsoon) between biophysical variables and species richness, while the woody subset of the species richness demonstrated marginally better relation at annual scale. The range of each biophysical proxy varied from medium to high, indicating higher vegetation strength. The species richness trend increased linearly for NDVI and EVI. The positive correlation showed by fPAR and LAI could be due to varied canopy architecture of the Western Ghats forests. Utility of fine resolution spatio-temporal data could render better understanding of species richness pattern using biophysical proxies, and thereby, help in long-term biodiversity monitoring.'\"], [\"Abstract: ' A survey of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) status of plants growing in the Western Ghats region of Southern India was undertaken.

This study attempts to understand the water and carbon cycles in two humid tropical river basins with its streams originating at higher altitudes of the Western Ghats, India. Water and suspended particulate matter (SPM) were collected on a monthly scale during summer monsoon season (June-September) from Swarna and Nethravati rivers draining into the Arabian Sea. For the source apportionment, samples have been measured for stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water and stable isotopes of carbon in particulate organic matter (POM) at spatial scale from tributaries and main channel of rivers, and runoff water from agricultural land (dominant paddy field) and forest in the downstream region. The association between and deuterium-excess in river water and rain water shows that water in these tropical basins depicts rainout effect of marine source moisture during the onset of summer monsoon. As the monsoon intensifies, the fresher rain water replenishes older water stored previously in sub surface soil layer leading to its flushing into the river during summer monsoon season. Stable carbon isotope ratio and elemental ratio of POM = -27.1 0.4 and C/N = 8.1 1.7) in two humid tropical river water during summer monsoon season is an admixture of suspended particulates from runoff water of forest = - 27.82 0.4 and agricultural land = -26.29 0.4 It is found that shows minimal variability with SPM content and C/N ratio within the same organic carbon pool.

The phenogram constructed using Euclidean distances for the eleven morphological characters showed that the populations were not grouped according to their geographical origin. The test for pairwise correlation between Euclidean distances of different morphological variables and genetic distances from AFLP data revealed that only petiole character (r =0.269; p =0.046) and height of tree (r =0.200; p =0.001) were significantly correlated with that of AFLP data matrix. The nine populations in this study covered a geographic area of about 1000 km stretch along the Western Ghat of South India. A test of correlation between genetic and geographic distance matrices revealed a significant positive correlation (r =0.475; p =0.009). The lack of perfect congruence between morphological and molecular data except for geographic distance, tree height and petiole character suggested that the morphological system might be useful for the morphotypes management but not appropriate to study the genetic structure of the teak populations.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'A population of the Western Ghats squirrel,Funamhulus tristriatus Waterhouse, was studied for some group attributes.

The slope of both watersheds varied from to and to respectively. Moreover, the slope variation is chiefly controlled by the local geology and erosion cycles. Each watershed was classified as a fifth-order drainage basin. The stream order of the basin was predominantly controlled by physiographic and structural conditions. The increase in stream length ratio from lower to higher order suggests that the study area has reached a mature geomorphic stage. The development of stream segments is affected by rainfall and local lithology of the watersheds.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'This article reports the structure of dominance and its relationship with social grooming in wild lion-tailed macaque females. The strength of dominance hierarchy was 0.79 on a scale of 0 to 1 indicating a moderate linearity in the ranking system. Dominance scores were converted into an ordinal as well as an interval scale. Grooming scores were also converted into interval scales using standard scores. Grooming received and grooming given correlated positively and negatively respectively with dominance ranks indicating that high ranking females received more and gave less grooming. Grooming was also positively related to encounter rates for dyads of females. More grooming among adjacent ranks, and grooming being more reciprocal, occurred only in the case of dominant females. The grooming patterns, therefore, appeared to be more of despotic than egalitarian nature. While ranking macaques into different Grades of social systems ranging from despotic to egalitarian, Thierry (2004) has placed lion-tailed macaques in Grade 3 corresponding to the social system. Our results indicate that the grooming and dominance relationships in this species are more despotic, and hence, the Grade for this species requires to be shifted toward 2 or 1.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The study was conducted in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, in the Western Ghats to understand the effect of a single fire event on tree diversity and regeneration status.

The majority of these present day landforms evolved in response to the tectonic activity that the Western Ghats witnessed during the Tertiary period. The major structural features together with the geomorphic units have predominant role in the occurrence of cataclysmic landslides which the windward slope of Western Ghats witness during the peak monsoon season. The Kerala and Periyar lineaments, which are the sites of minor earthquakes, pass through the study area. Escarpments and structural hill systems are the vulnerable landforms for landslide occurrence. Due to the predominant role of these tectonic and geomorphic features in the capricious change of landforms, a study was carried out in this hilly terrain based on geomorphology. The study of soil, slope morphometry, relative relief, land use/land cover and hydrogeological conditions together with a multidimensional analysis in a GIS environment resulted in classifying the entire area into different landslide susceptible zones based on Bureau of Indian Standards.

Antler phenology of chital (Axis axis) and sambar (Rusa unicolor) were studied in a deciduous habitat of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, Western Ghats, using vehicle transects for 2 successive years. Apparent breeding seasonality occurred with the majority of adult stags in hard antlers from May to mid October in chital and October to May in sambar Adult hard antler in chital correlated with mean group size, while sambar showed a weak correlation between adult hard antler and group size. Chitals prefer forming large groups at forest edges and open habitats while sambars prefer dense vegetation cover. Adult hard antlers in chital and sambar showed a weak relation to fawning since most adult females were in oestrus during the peak rutting season. Adult hard antlers in chital associated positively with rainfall and day length while sambar responded weakly to rainfall.

Water samples from 44 different sites during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons were collected for the analysis. During the pre-monsoon period, the faecal coliform count ranged from 230 to 110,000 while there was a variation from 200 to 4600 during the post-monsoon period. When the faecal streptococci count was analysed, it ranged from 140 to 110,000 during the pre-monsoon and 70 to 4600 during the post-monsoon seasons, respectively. All the samples collected were found to have total viable count (TVC) higher than those prescribed by Bureau of Indian Standards (ISI 1991). Total viable counts were found in the range of to in the pre-monsoon and to in the post-monsoon. The presence of faecal indicator bacteria, Escherichia coli and potentially pathogenic bacteria, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Salmonella enterica in the Meenachil River indicates that the bacteriological quality of the Meenachil River is poor. Moreover, it sheds light to the fact that raw sewage is being dumped into the Meenachil River. Urban runoffs and effluents of rubber factories appear to be the important sources of faecal contamination in the river.

The LULC for 2030 is projected using the land change modeller with the assumption of normal growth. The sensitivity analysis, model calibration, and validation indicated that the SWAT model could reasonably simulate streamflow and sediment yield in the river basin. The results showed that the spatial extent of the LULC classes of urban agriculture and water bodies increased, whereas that of forest grassland and bare land decreased from 1972 to 2030. The streamflow increased steadily (7.88%) with changes in LULC, whereas the average annual sediment yield decreased (0.028%) between 1972 and 1991 and increased later (0.029%) until 2012.

It may be estimated by methods involving growth ring counts, or by methods involving field measurements of growth rates. Direct methods are considered more accurate, but it is not clear if they are appropriate for all species, notably from the humid tropics. In this paper we assess the occurrence of annual growth rings and their utility for age estimation in three tropical tree species, Acrocarpus fraxinifolius, Dalbergia latifolia (Fabaceae) and Syzygium cumini (Myrtaceae), growing in traditional shade coffee plantations of the southern Western Ghats, India. These species previously were described as having or growth rings. We used anatomical studies, field measurements and computational methods to characterise growth rings and assess similarities between directly and indirectly estimated tree ages. Our study revealed that annual growth rings were characterised by different sets of anatomical features per species and were most distinct in the fast-growing deciduous A. fraxinifolius. Growth rates measured in the field showed annual periodicity in all three species, and reflected annual rainfall-drought cycles in D. latifolia and S. cumini. Direct age estimates were most similar to indirect estimates in D. latifolia, and least so in S. cumini. The results of direct age estimation by counting rings are consistent with them being annual in nature in tropical species with distinct and reliable annual growth ring formation. However, for species with poorly defined growth rings, indirect age estimation methods might be more useful.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The Western Ghats plays a pivotal role in determining the hydrological and hydroclimatic regime of Peninsular India. The mountainous catchments of the Ghats are the primary contributors of flow in the rivers that sustains the life and agricultural productivity in the area. Although many studies have been conducted in the past decades to understand long term trends in the meteorological and hydrological variables of major river basins, not much attention have been made to unfold the relationship existing among rainfall and river hydrology of natural drainages on either side of the Western Ghats which host one of the unique biodiversity hotspots across the world. Therefore, an attempt has been made in this paper to examine the short term (last three decades) changes in the rainfall pattern and its influence on the hydrological characteristics of some of the important rivers draining the southern Western Ghats as a case study. The short term, annual and seasonal trends in the rainfall, and its variability and discharge were analyzed using Mann-Kendall test and estimator of slope. The study showed a decreasing trend in rainfall in the southwest monsoon while a reverse trend is noticed in northeast monsoon. Correspondingly, the discharge of the west and east flowing rivers also showed a declining trend in the southwest monsoon season. The runoff coefficient also followed the trends in the discharge. The runoff coefficient of the Periyar river showed a decreasing trend, whereas the Cauvery river exhibited an increasing trend. A high-resolution analysis of rainfall data revealed that the number of moderate rainfall events showed a decreasing trend throughout the southern Western Ghats, whereas the high intensity rainfall events showed an opposite trend. The decline in groundwater level in the areas which recorded an increase in high intensity rainfall events and decrease in moderate rainfall events showed that the groundwater recharge process is significantly affected by changes in the rainfall pattern of the area.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The present study has generated spatial databases on the vegetation type with plant biodiversity, forest fragmentation and disturbance regimes in Tamilnadu parts of Eastern Ghats (EG), India.

The anthropogenic activities such as power generation (burning of fossil fuels), agriculture (livestock, farming, rice cultivation and burning of crop residues), polluting water bodies, and industry and urban activities (transport, mismanagement of solid, liquid waste, etc.) have risen substantially CO2 concentrations to 72% among GHGs. Emissions and sequestration of carbon need to be in balance to sustain ecosystem functions and maintain the environmental conditions. Forests are the major carbon sinks to mitigate global warming. The current research focusses on the carbon budgeting through quantification of emissions and sinks in the Uttara Kannada district, central Western Ghats, Karnataka. This would help in evolving appropriate mitigation strategies towards sustainable management of forests. The study reveals that total carbon stored in vegetation and soils are and respectively. The annual carbon increment in forests is about Carbon uptake by the natural forest is about and by the forest plantations is amounting to the total of Sector-wise carbon emissions are (livestock), (paddy cultivation), (fuel wood consumption), and (vehicular transport), respectively. The analysis highlights that forest ecosystems in Uttara Kannada are playing a significant role in the mitigation of regional as well as global carbon emissions. Hence, the premium should be on conservation of the remaining native forests, which are vital for the water security (perennial streams) and food security (sustenance of biodiversity) and mitigation of global warming through carbon sequestration.

Especially in regions with water scarcity, high climate sensitivity, and dynamic socioeconomic development, an adaptation of water management strategies is needed. Our study aims at (i) testing a new downscaling approach to utilize climate model results in a meso-scale hydrologic model and at (ii) analyzing the impact of climate change on the water balance components in the Mula and Mutha Rivers catchment upstream of the city of Pune, India. The new downscaling approach relies on the inherent consistency of both, the climate model and the measured data. It allows to derive a representation of a future climate scenario by rearranging past measurements We found a good agreement of the monthly statistics of the rearranged and the original measured data in the baseline period. However, the downscaling method is limited by the range of measured values provided in the baseline period, which results in an underestimation of temperatures in the last of the scenario period. The downscaled weather data for IPCC emission scenario A1B were used in a hydrologic impact assessment with SWAT. The scenario resulted in higher evapotranspiration, particularly in the first months of the dry season and in repeated low water storages in the reservoirs at the end of rainy season.

In rhizosphere, amongst Alphaproteobacteria members, Bradyrhizobium formed the significant proportion, whereas in non-rhizosphere, members of subdivision-6 of phylum Acidobacteria were abundant. The diversity analysis of P. patula soil libraries showed that the phylotypes (16S rRNA gene similarity cutoff, of Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes were relatively predominant and diverse followed by Alphaproteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. The diversity indices estimated higher richness and abundance of bacteria in P. patula soil clone libraries than the pine forest clone libraries retrieved from previous studies. The tools like principal co-ordinate analysis and Jackknife cluster analysis, which were under UniFrac analysis indicated that variations in soil bacterial communities were attributed to their respective geographical locations due to the phylogenetic divergence amongst the clone libraries. Overall, the P. patula rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere clone libraries were found significantly unique in composition, evenly distributed and highly rich in phylotypes, amongst the biogeographically distant clone libraries.

The bat capture rate was the highest in the moist deciduous forest describing higher bat populations compared with the places of human habitation. Utilities of 21 climate, three physiographic and two disturbance variables and species distribution modelling could reveal that the north-eastern part was more suitable for bat distributions than the southern part of the region. The climate, physiographic and disturbance variables were crucial in their distributions, where elevation and potential evapotranspiration were highly significant. Unlike other species, Taphozous melanopogon showed negative correlation with these variables. The mean diurnal temperature and precipitation seasonality have positive influence on bat distributions, indicating their resilience to seasonal precipitation changes and day time temperature fluctuations. The negative effect of temperature seasonality on the distribution of Pteropus giganteus could attribute to its vulnerability to climate change effects.

The sanctuary appears susceptible to continuing disturbances under the current management regime but at lower rates than in surrounding unprotected areas.

Landscape ecology plays an important role in integrating the different scales of biodiversity from habitat patch to biome level. Satellite remote sensing technology with multi-sensor capabilities offers multi-scale information on landscape composition and configuration. Advances in geospatial analytical tools and spatial statistics have improved the capability to quantify spatial heterogeneity. Globally, landscape level characterization of biodiversity has become an important discipline of science. Considering the vast extent, heterogeneity, and ecological and economic importance of forest landscapes, significant efforts have been made in India during the past decade to strengthen landscape level biodiversity characterization. The generic frame work of studies comprises preparation of national databases providing information on composition and configuration of different landscapes using multi-scale remote sensing techniques, understanding the landscape patterns using geospatial models to elicit disturbance and diversity patterns and application of this information for bioprospecting and conservation purposes. Studies on hierarchical linkage of multi-scale information to study the processes of change, landscape function, dynamics of habitat fragmentation, invasion, development of network of conservation areas based on the understanding of multi-species responses to landscape mosaics, macro-ecological studies to understand environment and species richness, habitat and species transitions and losses, landscape level solutions to adaptation and mitigation strategies to climate change are a few of the future challenges.

We also visited 107 temples/tourist spots to determine the presence of primates. Bonnet macaques and Hanuman langurs were widely distributed, whereas rhesus macaques were not found in the state. However, bonnet macaques were absent in a few districts in the northern plains and Hanuman langurs were absent in some districts of the southern plains. A total of 205 groups of bonnet macaques and 139 groups of Hanuman langurs were sighted. The relative encounter rate of both species differed across biogeographic zones. Bonnet macaques were largely encountered in the Western Ghats and the Southern Plateau whereas Hanuman langurs were abundant in the Western Ghats and Northern Plains. We found that bonnet macaques have been eliminated from about 48% temples/tourist spots where they occurred in the recent past. The Hanuman langur population of Road was assessed during April 2003, and we found that the present population size was about 38% of a previous survey in 1961. Habitat change, hunting/trapping and translocation were the major factors causing a decline in the langur population.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Sacred groves are patches of forests preserved for their spiritual and religious significance. The practice gained relevance with the spread of agriculture that caused large-scale deforestation affecting biodiversity and watersheds. Sacred groves may lose their prominence nowadays, but are still relevant in Indian rural landscapes inhabited by traditional communities. The recent rise of interest in this tradition encouraged scientific study that despite its pan-Indian distribution, focused on northeast, Western Ghats and east coast either for their global/importance or unique ecosystems. Most studies focused on flora, mainly angiosperms, and the faunal studies concentrated on vertebrates while lower life forms were grossly neglected. Studies on ecosystem functioning are few although observations are available. Most studies attributed watershed protection values to sacred groves but hardly highlighted hydrological process or water yield in comparison with other land use types. The grove studies require diversification from a stereotyped path and must move towards creating credible scientific foundations for conservation. Documentation should continue in unexplored areas but more work is needed on basic ecological functions and ecosystem dynamics to strengthen planning for scientifically sound sacred grove management.'\"], ['Abstract: Abstract not available'], [\"Abstract: 'Director of environmental studies at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Human Ecology, Environmental and Population Studies at the University of Rajasthan.

Species diversity, dominance, species richness and evenness indices of plant communities and also population structure of woody plants were enumerated. A total of 244 species (183 genera and 76 families) were recorded. Species richness (number of species) were 82,142 and 96 species per 0.3 ha respectively for the study areas of low-elevation forest (LEF), mid-elevation forest (MEF) and high elevation forest (HEF). Species diversity indices were greater in MEF compared to the other two forests except juveniles. In contrast, greater dominance value indices were recorded in LEF than other forests. Density and basal area of the MEF were twice greater than the LEF, while HEF showed greater tree density and low basal area when compared to LEF. The stem density and species richness (number of species) decreased with increased size classes of trees observed in the present study indicated good regeneration status. Population structure of juveniles and seedlings also reflects good regeneration status. Terminalia paniculata (IVI of 99.9) and Hopea parviflora (IVI of 103.8) were dominant tree species respectively in LEF and MEF whereas in HEF Agrostistachys meeboldii (63.65), Cullenia excelsa (63.67) and Drypetes oblongifolia (39.67) share the dominance. Past damage (anthropogenic perturbation) may be one of the reasons for single species dominance in LEF and MEF.

The species, however, differed in other plant, flower, pod and seed characteristics. Within species variation was higher in V. mungo var. silvestris populations and three distinct clusters could be identified in multivariate analysis. V. umbellata showed more similarity to V. dalzelliana than V. bourneae and V. minima in the angularis-umbellata (azuki bean) group. Within species variations was higher in V. umbellata than other species in the group. In the aconitifolia-trilobata (mothbean), V. trilobata populations, were more diverse than V. aconitifolia.

It is essential to have a spatial framework by creating the indicator using existing remote sensing-based data. In this work, conservation principles were integrated at the ecosystem level covering irreplaceability and vulnerability along with representativeness. Forest persistence, ecosystem rarity, forest intactness, landscape-level ecosystem, biomass carbon stocks, and biological richness were among the biological criteria used to analyze ecosystem irreplaceability. The proxies used for ecosystem vulnerability are high fragmentation, fire hotspots and proximity to disturbance factors. A unique value is assigned to each individual pixel in the prioritization map. Overall representation of habitat coverage in protected area network of South Asian countries indicates under-representation of several forest types with less than 17% coverage.

Temporal analysis of landuse dynamics reveals the changing pattern of the studied landscape. There is fast reduction of forest cover in last to meet up the demand of agricultural land and plantation programs. A thorough survey and assessment of woody endemic species distribution in the study area documented presence of 19 endemic species. The distribution of these species is highly skewed towards the culturally protected patches in comparison to other land use elements. It is found that, among the 19 woody endemic species, those with greater ecological amplitude are widely distributed in the studied landscape in groves as well as other land use forms whereas, natural population of the sensitive endemics are very much restricted in the sacred grove fragments. The recent degradation in the sacred grove system is perhaps, due to weakening of traditional belief systems and associated laxity in grove protection leading to biotic disturbances.

In case of shrubs, dominance index significantly (P<0.007) increased along the disturbance gradient, whereas evenness index significantly (P<0.005) decreased with an increasing level of disturbance. Shannon-Weiner diversity index for herbs significantly (P<0.016) increased with increasing disturbance whereas, dominance index was significantly (P<0.013) declined along the disturbance gradient. Results revealed that cm dbh classes constituted the highest stem density, and highest basal area was recorded in the >100 cm dbh class in all three sites. Density of the matured trees decreased with increasing DBH whereas, tree basal area tended to increase with increasing DBH in all three sites. Tree species richness was highest in the lower DBH classes. 62.07% of the total tree species regenerated in the largely undisturbed site followed by 50% in the mildly disturbed and 26.32% in the highly disturbed site. The overall regeneration condition was found to be good in the largely undisturbed site. Mildly disturbed site exhibited fair regeneration and so was in the highly disturbed site. Discernable variations in species composition, diversity, regeneration and tree population structure revealed the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on rainforest vegetation dynamics. Higher degree of disturbance was furtherly found not only affecting species diversity but also promoting the growth of invasive weed species. Dominance of Hydnocarpus kurzii and Crypteronia paniculata in the highly disturbed site also indicated that these less-valued timber species may benefit from the vegetation mosaic produced by the disturbance; so differences in abundance of these species may be useful for bio-indication.

These deposits were formed due to wide spread tectonothermal events associated with the evolution of Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt (EGMB). The graphite deposits of East Godavari district are epigenetic, rhombohedral fluid deposited type and are one of the four deposits of such type reported so far from Srilanka, Spain and England. The graphite deposits were formed due to granodioritic intrusion into the Narsipatnam shear zone, which caused migmatisation of khondalites along with mobilisation and concentration of graphite, as veins and lenses, into the graphite gneisses. The graphite gneisses were subsequently intruded by quartz rich pegmatites that were laden with tungsten mineralisation. The tungsten mineralisation occurs as thin bands, lenses, stringers and vein lets within the quartz matrix and also dispersed in the graphite gneisses. Inclusions of tungsten in graphite indicate that tungsten mineralisation succeeded graphite mineralisation. However, the low P-T phenomenon of tungsten (wolframite-ferberite) mineralisation resulted in low tenor of tungsten ore deposits (WO3: 0.10%). Rare earth elements (REE) are associated with tungsten mineralisation in these areas. During the present study, these graphite-tungsten deposits have been re-examined, in the backdrop of shelving graphite-tungsten projects in these areas. The feed for mineral beneficiation tests was decided on the basis of dispersion of tungsten in quartz and graphite rich fractions of the ore zone. The feed (ROM material) on beneficiation gave recovery of +75% graphite concentrate, tungsten concentrate of consistent chemical grade, besides recovery of sizeable REE concentrate. It also rendered use of unutilised graphite tailing dumps at beneficiation plants, thereby effecting conservation. Thus, the association of tungsten and REE with the entire graphite deposits along with their value addition during beneficiation, as by-product, revived opportunities to restart graphite mining in the Burugubanda, Pydiputta and Tapasikonda areas in particular and East Godavari district, in general, as an economically viable venture.

Relatively high genetic diversity was measured in the temperate populations (Ht = 0.21; Nm = 1.13) than tropical Rhododendrons. The hierarchical analysis of molecular variance showed that among the total variance, 25% is residing within populations while 63% of variance is among regions apparently revealing that disjunct distribution has structured genetic differentiation pattern in this species. Grouping of samples was in conformity with their spatial distribution, which was confirmed by UPGMA cluster analysis and PCA scatter plot. The taxon with its unique distribution pattern and wide cross compatibility between sub-species is however threatened by low genetic variation and gene flow that catalyses shifting towards genetic drift and hence long-term conservation strategies need to be formulated particularly for the tropical Rhododendron sub-species.

This paper also describes impacts of human interventions (such as plantations of exotic forest species to restore degraded landscapes) on the water balance components in diverse hydro-geo-environmental conditions in the Indian sub-continent. We focus on identifying the research areas which require immediate attention to develop tools to assist planners and policy makers in assessing and managing the water resources in these complex environments.

Local farmers appreciate native biodiversity, but plantation economics and public policies drive them to gradually replace the original diversified cover with exotic shade trees such as Grevillea robusta, which grows fast and can be easily traded as timber. In order to identify and recommend native timber trees with fast growth rates, we compared the growth performance of four common native species against that of G. robusta, by fitting steel dendrometer bands on 332 shade trees. Results showed that in general G. robusta had the fastest growth rates, but large trees of the native Acrocarpus fraxinifolius had faster growth in the wet western side of the district. Computer projections of long term performance showed that most species were influenced by bioclimatic zone. Species-specific local environmental effects also occurred, including competition from coffee bushes for A. fraxinifolius, influence of aspect for G. robusta, and management block effects for Lagerstroemia microcarpa. Our results show that native species  potentially could produce timber at rates equivalent to those of exotic species. However, as in many tropical countries, data on growth rates of native trees within mixed-cover plantations are scarce and this study underlines the urgent need to screen for fast-growing species. Such information provides a strong basis for recommending appropriate changes in public policies that would improve tree tenure security and encourage farmers to grow more native species.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Tree species diversity and population structure at different community types were described and analyzed for primary and secondary lowland moist deciduous forests in Tripura. Overall 10,957 individual trees belonging to 46 family, 103 genera and 144 species were counted at cm DBH (diameter at breast height) using 28 permanent belt transects with a size of 1 ha (10 m 1000 m). Four different tree communities were identified. The primary forests was dominated by Shorea robusta (mean density 464.77 105 species) and Schima wallichii (336.25 82 species), while the secondary forests was dominated by Tectona grandis (333.88 105 species) and Hevea brasiliensis (299.67 82 species). Overall mean basal area in this study was the maximum value was recorded in primary Shorea forest (26.21 Mean density and diversity indices were differed significantly within four different communities. No significant differences were observed in number of species, genera, family and tree basal cover area. Significant relationships were found between the species richness and different tree population groups across the communities. Results revealed that species diversity and density were increased in those forests due to past disturbances which resulted in slow accumulation of native oligarchic small tree species. Seventeen species were recorded with <2 individuals of which Saraca asoka (Roxb.) de Wilde and Entada phaseoloides (L.) Merr. etc. extensively used in local ethno-medicinal formulations. The present S. robusta Gaertn dominated forest was recorded richer (105 species) than other reported studies. Moraceae was found more speciose family instead of Papilionaceae and Euphorbiaceae than other Indian moist deciduous forests. Seasonal phenological gap in such moist deciduous forests influenced the population of Trachypithecus pileatus and capped langur. The analysis of FIV suggested a slow trend of shifting the population of Lamiaceae group by Moraceae species in secondary T. grandis L. dominated community.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Molecular techniques are gaining importance in biodiversity conservation in India.

Hence, it is indispensable to determine the response of watersheds to hydrological processes for water resource management. Thus, the hydrological response-based watershed prioritization study has been undertaken for eight sub-watersheds from semiarid, basaltic region of Western Ghats of India. Intent to this, a novel index has been parameterized using thematic layers such as drainage density, geology, soil, slope, landform classification, land use/land cover, rainfall and runoff (DGSLR). This study evaluates the performance of DGSLR index using three models, namely analytical hierarchy process (AHP), frequency ratio (FR) and fuzzy logic for sub-watershed-wise prioritization. The FR ratio showed the highest value for very high drainage density (8.73) indicating most probability for a high hydrological response. According to AHP weight, most influencing factors to hydrological processes are precipitation (25%), slope (19%) and land use/land cover (14%) followed by landform classification (11%). These three area into four classes, i.e., very high, high, moderate and low using area-weighted average method. These models showed that very high-priority area lies near the outlet of the watershed as well as the upper part of the watershed in high to very high priority in all three models. It covers 33.12% of the total area having a high average slope with high drainage density in sub-watersheds 1, 3, 7 and 8. The predictive capability of DGSLR index was computed by the area under the curve (AUC) and receiver operating method, revealed average accuracy for FR method better than AHP method and fuzzy logic This novel index could be used by the water resources researchers and planners in any terrain to understand the hydrological response.'\"], [\"leaf harvest in South India'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Many economically important non-timber forest products (NTFPs) come from widespread and common plant species.

J. D. Hook., an endemic and endangered orchid of the Western Ghats of Kerala, and its reintroduction to the natural habitat were accomplished. Rhizome segments of Ipsea cultured on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 6.97 kinetin induced the highest number of shoots, at the rate of four shoots per explant within 50 d. Transfer of the isolated shoots increased the rate of shoot multiplication to more than 10 shoots. Subsequent culture enhanced the number of shoots. No decline of shoot multiplication was observed up to the 10th subculture. Shoots developed bulbs during culture which developed into rhizomes. Sucrose at reduced the time for the development of bulbs and rhizomes. Roots were developed from the base of the developed shoots as well as from the bulbs. Isolation and culture of bulbs also developed shoots within 50 d. Encapsulated in vitro-formed bulbs cultured either on hormone-free halfstrength MS or 6.97 kinetin-supplemented medium facilitated 100% conversion. As a step to conservation in situ, 50 plantlets were reintroduced into their natural habitat, i.e. at Vellarimala (at 1300 m height) of the Western Ghats of Kerala, and flowered normally. Development of more than 40 000 plantlets starting from a single explant is possible within 250 d. This threatened endemic orchid stands to benefit greatly from the established protocol and will hopefully curtail the threat of extinction.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Global conservation efforts have traditionally focused on biodiversity hotspots and other priority landscapes. However, large areas outside priority sites have high conservation value and are referred to as neglected landscapes. The Eastern Ghats of India is an unexplored forest landscape of high conservation value with several endemic and threatened species reported, and is also home to many indigenous forest-dwelling communities. However, it remains a neglected area for conservation and only 3.53% of this landscape is protected. Here, we examine the effectiveness of protected areas in neglected landscapes in preventing forest degradation, and how community perceptions can be used to understand satellite-based landscape change analyses at village level. This study was conducted in Papikonda National park (PNP) and its unprotected buffers in Eastern Ghats. Forest degradation was higher in the buffer (32%) than inside PNP (12%) between 1991 and 2014. Communities attributed shifting cultivation, plantations and over-extraction of forest resources as being the major drivers of forest degradation. Community observations of change were not significantly correlated with spatial measures of change. Forest degradation was higher outside the PA at a landscape level and inside the PA at the village level, therefore the PA was effective in reducing degradation at the landscape level but not at the village level inside the PA. We further discuss the role of community observations in interpreting forest degradation in neglected forest landscapes.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Landslide is one of the devastating natural phenomenon that threatens human life and property. Every year a number of persons lost their lives due to the landslides. Therefore, a better understanding and characterization of landslide is very essential for adopting mitigation strategies to contain the adversities of this natural hazard. Information on landslides from different climatic setup are very essential for better understanding of the influence of weathering, rainfall, or topography on landslide generation. Weathering is one of the important causative factor for landslide generation in the moderate topography or inactive mountainous terrain. The Western Ghats including the Deccan Traps, an inactive mountain range, receives torrential rainfall. Intense rainfall in these areas enhances the weathering processes and fabricates thick soil covers. Mahabaleshwar area, Maharashtra was chosen as a case study, where high elevated part is covered by lateritic layer and each lava flow unit is separated by a thin weathered bed of red bole. The area experiences series of landslides during the summer monsoon months. Mainly two types of landslides have been identified in the area confined with the red bole bed and powdery lateritic soil. The first type of landslides occur at higher elevations where horizontal beds of permeable laterites underlined by impermeable thick basalt beds. The rain water infiltrates down and spread laterally within the permeable lateritic beds. It finally spouts at lower plateau elevations and triggers mainly debris flows. The other category of landslides occurs where the weathered red bole bed separates two successive lava flows. The percolating water from the secondary porosities (joints and inter connected vugs) comes out from the contact zones of basalt and red bole bed in the form of seepages. It erodes the red bole bed and as a result the overlying masses hang and consequently lead to rock fall. The Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) of the representative samples from landslide locations indicates significant weathering. The CIA values for the fine lateritic soil are up to 98% whereas for the red bole bed it varies from 77 to 85%. This suggests a high chemical weathering and higher erodibility. The association of active landslide locations with the red bole bed and fine lateritic soil suggests a close relation between weathering and landslide occurrences in the area.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'India is home to thousands of community-protected forests, called sacred groves. Sacred forests or groves are sites that have cultural or spiritual significance to the people who live around them. These areas may also be key reservoirs of biodiversity. In India, most sacred groves are managed by a community group, not by a government agency. They are often private or community land, not formal protected areas or parks. This poses an interesting challenge in terms of future management and possible policy relating to the sacred groves. On the international level, organizations such as the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and UNESCO have created guidelines for management of sacred sites. On the national level, past Forest Acts and recent Forest Rights Act have relevance to the sacred groves. Local differences in land tenure also affect the groves. Ethnographic research conducted in 2009 and 2010 in the states of Meghalaya and Karnataka, India, evaluated the historic and current management and beliefs associated with sacred forests. Cultural change and pressure to use natural resources within the groves is leading to reduction of these forest areas. In the future, a creative combination of policy approaches to conserve groves that respects their spiritual values is recommended.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'For any conservation strategy to be effective, it must be preceded by knowledge of how diversity is configured within the area of interest. Here, data from 40 savanna-grassland sites were used to examine how plant biodiversity and species composition varied across spatial scales at the Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (KMTR), south India. Grasslands surveyed contained 278 plant species, and were characterized by high spatial variability in species association patterns. Fourteen distinct community assemblages were identified, organized primarily along an elevation gradient in the reserve. Overall, grasslands at KMTR were characterized by the dominance of a few, widespread species. The bulk of species richness, however, resulted from subordinate species with fairly restricted distributions. At low elevations, grasslands had high species richness and species composition differed greatly between sites. Mid-elevation grasslands contained about half the number of species present at low elevations, but sites were more similar in species composition. Richness of high-elevation grasslands was a third of that found at low elevations, but different sites harbored unique sets of species. Herbivore use of grasslands varied between communities and showed patterns that coincided with elevation. Herbivore use of low-elevation communities was high albeit variable, of mid-elevation sites was consistently low, and increased at higher elevations. Tall grass communities were the least utilized by herbivores at all elevations. Most species surveyed were rare and restricted in their distribution suggesting that conservation efforts must, perforce, encompass the entire reserve. However, differences in the structuring of diversity across elevations, and in herbivore use of grasslands, suggest that conservation efforts can be partitioned differentially across locations, specifically targeting low and high elevation grasslands in the reserve.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The sal (Shorea robusta) forest vegetation of Sohagibarawa Wildlife Sanctuary, Gorakhpur, India was analysed to assess plant diversity, regeneration pattern and the status of species conservation. A total of 208 plant species representing 165 genera and 72 families were recorded. Species richness, mean density and basal area of individuals in the observed forest were compared with those of other sal-dominated forests of India. The sal forest was rich in Papilionaceae (23 species), which contributed maximally to the total number of individuals of <30 cm girth. After sal, density was maximal for a leguminous shrub, Moghania chappar. In addition to the usual recruitment by seed, a number of species also showed non-seed regeneration through storage roots, sprouts or ramet proliferation. The individuals regenerating as sprouts from underground stem or storage organs contributed significantly to the sum total of individuals/ha. As much as 45.5% of the total individuals were of ramet origin and shared 10.6% of the total species richness of the forest. In stands facing moderate to low disturbance, thickets of dense entangled mass of vegetation, predominantly composed of thorny lianas, were identified that usually contained less common and rare species like Rauwolfia serpentina, Desmodium latifolium, Crotalaria alata and Gloriosa superba in addition to the frequent ones. These thickets help to conserve the special habitat conditions and provide protection for natural regeneration of several infrequent and rare plant species and thus contribute towards the maintenance and in situ conservation of overall diversity of recurrently disturbed forest vegetation.'\"], [\"Abstract: ' Curculigo orchioides Gaertn. (family Hypoxidaceae) is an endangered anticarcinogenic and aphrodisiac herb, native of India. This study reports the effect of three arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal inocula on post-transplanting performance of raised C. orchioides plantlets. The three AM fungal inocula consisted of two monospecific cultures of Glomus geosporum and G. microcarpum and one crude consortium of AM fungal spores isolated from rhizosphere soil of C. orchioides growing in natural habitat. Complete plantlets of C. orchioides were raised by direct organogenesis of leaf explants on half strength Murashige and medium devoid of any growth hormone. C. orchioides plantlets responded significantly different to all three mycorrhizal treatments. Mycorrhization enhanced the survival rate of C. orchioides plantlets to 100%. The inoculated plantlets fared significantly better than the uninoculated ones in terms of biomass production and number of leaves and roots per plant. Mycorrhizal plantlets exhibited higher concentrations of photosynthetic pigments as well as minerals P, Mg, Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe in both shoots and roots. Among the three inocula tested, plantlets inoculated with the mixed consortium of AM fungi consistently performed better in terms of the parameters evaluated. The study suggests use of mixed consortium of AM fungi over monospecific cultures for the sustainable cultivation and conservation of endangered medicinal plant: Curculigo orchioides.'\"], [\"Abstract: summarize the research on Asian Sun catfish, Horabagrus brachysoma an endemic and threatened freshwater catfish from Western Ghats of India, and provide a comprehensive review of its taxonomy, distribution, biology, population, conservation and aquaculture. Although described in 1864, the taxonomy of H. brachysoma, particularly its familial affinities, continues to be in flux. The species, originally described from the erstwhile of in present day Kerala State, India, has a current distribution ranging from southern Kerala to southern Maharashtra where they are found in lowland westward-flowing rivers, as well as natural freshwater lakes and backwaters. As a much relished food fish, H. brachysoma is exploited throughout its range, predominantly through an unmanaged artisanal fishery. Although there are no scientific estimates of either the status or trends in overall population of this endemic catfish, anecdotal evidence and fisher-knowledge suggests drastic declines of several local populations. The fishery for H. brachysoma in the Periyar and Achenkovil rivers in the State of Kerala has been documented to be unsustainable. As a result of an overall population decline of due to overharvest and habitat loss, H. brachysoma is assessed as on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Primary research on various aspects of feeding, reproductive biology and demography has generated a wealth of information on the species, but this knowledge is yet to be utilized for the development and implementation of in situ conservation or management plans. In view of its high consumer demand, efficient biological and eco-physiological characteristics, as well as the availability of a captive breeding technology, H. brachysoma is considered an emerging species for small-scale aquaculture. Priorities for scientific research to address knowledge-gaps, as well as strategies for effective conservation of this threatened freshwater catfish are discussed.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Corridors (variably called landscape linkages, connectors, and gateways) are expanses of a landscape that facilitate the flow or movement of individuals, genes, and ecological processes. Protected areas with their buffer zones and the corridors that connect them are cornerstones of modern conservation actions to maintain the biodiversity we have and restore what we have lost. Policy and governance to guide the establishment and management of protected areas and supporting buffer zones is well established in the Central Indian Highlands. A policy and governance structure to create the context and enabling conditions for corridor maintenance, creation, and recovery is emerging but is constrained by the reigning land-management paradigm that separates conservation from development rather than mainstreaming species and habitat conservation into the rural development agenda. Well-nourished, healthy human populations and healthy ecosystems are inextricably linked. The worsening ecological conditions in the Central Indian Highlands can trigger the emergence of a common agenda for an inclusive, caring, and environment-friendly mode of development. The alternative is the business-as-usual scenario: a continuation of worsening ecological conditions. Entry points through the biodiversity, agriculture production, resource extraction, and economic/social sectors to enable integrated sustainable landscape management are identified. These include deepening what it means to successfully conserve a species combined with explicit threat analysis for at-risk tigers and the landscapes that supports them; landscape scenario modeling to advance communication by synthesizing diverse forms of research and articulating and evaluating alternative socio-economic futures; and the use of the smart green infrastructure process as an approach to development rather than only as a way to mitigate environmental damage. Models are presented to scale up from isolated conservation interventions to collective impact that unites supportive government partners with individuals, NGOs, and economic interests to achieve viable long-term relationships in human and natural systems to value, maintain, and recover landscape connectivity.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'This study sought to reconstruct the history of Lantana invasion and spread in India by considering two questions; (a) from where, by who, and when were Lantana species introduced into India? and (b) given its long history in the country, is it still spreading or more or less stable? We critically evaluated the archival and historical information on plant imports by the European powers into India during the period before and after British colonization. We then reconstructed the path of spread by analyzing the spatio-temporal patterns of occurrence and distribution of Lantana in India at both the national and local scale using a GIS platform. The spread of Lantana across the globe started as early as the 1690s. The European colonial powers moved the plants from Latin America to Europe and to their colonial countries in the early 1800s. Lantana species were introduced in India from 1807 onwards and thereafter the colonial powers moved this plant across the country. Following its introduction into India, the spread of Lantana across the country, either through subsequent multiple introductions from Europe to different British cantonments, or through moving the plants between cantonments within India, were reasonably rapid spanning only a few decades. In the absence of a rigorous control program, the spread of Lantana has gone on unabated and thereby impacting both wildlife and biodiversity.'\"], ['Abstract: Abstract not available'], [\"Abstract: 'We make an assessment of the impact of projected climate change on forest ecosystems in India. This assessment is based on climate projections of the Regional Climate Model of the Hadley Centre (HadRM3) and the dynamic global vegetation model IBIS for A2 and B2 scenarios. According to the model projections, 39% of forest grids are likely to undergo vegetation type change under the A2 scenario and 34% under the B2 scenario by the end of this century. However, in many forest dominant states such as Chattisgarh, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh up to 73%, 67% and 62% of forested grids are projected to undergo change. Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is projected to increase by 68.8% and 51.2% under the A2 and B2 scenarios, respectively, and soil organic carbon (SOC) by 37.5% for A2 and 30.2% for B2 scenario. Based on the dynamic global vegetation modeling, we present a forest vulnerability index for India which is based on the observed datasets of forest density, forest biodiversity as well as model predicted vegetation type shift estimates for forested grids. The vulnerability index suggests that upper Himalayas, northern and central parts of Western Ghats and parts of central India are most vulnerable to projected impacts of climate change, while Northeastern forests are more resilient.

The results showed that there was a net decrease of 475.7 km2 forest cover (rate of deforestation = 2.34) from 1973 to 1990 and 402.3 km2 (rate of deforestation = 2.27) from 1990 to 2004. Forest cover has changed over time depending on a few factors such as large-scale deforestation, shifting cultivation, dam and road construction, unregulated management actions, and social pressure. A significant increase of 1222.8 km2 agriculture area clearly indicated the conversion of forest cover to agricultural land. These alterations had resulted in significant environmental consequences, including decline in forest cover, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity. There is an urgent need for rational management of the remaining forest for it to be able to survive beyond next decades. Particular attention must be paid to tropical forests, which are rapidly being deforested.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Flying squirrels are capable of gliding and one of the least known mammals of the world. Work on these animals is less and sporadic due to their crepuscular and cryptic habits. At the present scenario, a complete pilot study is in an urgent need to formulate conservation strategies and policies to conserve them in India. Therefore, a thorough review on biology and conservation status of flying squirrels in India is provided here. A total of 13 species of flying squirrels present in India i.e., Belomys pearsonii, Biswamoyopterus biswasi, Eupetaurus cinereus, Eoglaucomys fimbriatus, Hylopetes alboniger, Petaurista elegans, P. mishmiensis, P. magnificus, P. mechukaensis, P. nobilis, P. petaurista, P. philippensis and Petinomys fuscocapillus, wherein three are endemic to the country. P. philippensis has broader distribution and is found to be more studied than others. Eastern part of the country contains the highest species number follows three in northern part, two in southern part and one in western part subsequently. All species are facing threat to their population due to native habitat loss, degradation and hunting. Harmonization, alliances and partnership between various stakeholders along with better application of standard techniques would be strengthen to develop conservation strategies and implementing their coordinated actions could preserve flying future in the country landscape.'\"], [\"Abstract: ' Gonoproktopterus curmuca is an endangered red tailed barb found in Southern part of Western Ghat, India. As a part of stock-specific, propagation assisted rehabilitation and management program, polymorphic microsatellites markers were used to study the genetic diversity and population structure of this species from the three River systems of Southern Western Ghats, such as Periyar River, the Chalakkudy River, and the Chaliyar River. From selected eight polymorphic microsatellite markers, the number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 8, and the average number of alleles among 3 populations ranged from 5.0 to 5.75. The mean observed (Hob) and expected (Hex) heterozygosity ranged from 0.5148 to 0.5360 and from 0.5996 to 0.6067, respectively. Significant deviations from Equilibrium expectation were found at majority of the loci (except Gcur MFW72 and Gcur MFW19) and in all three populations in which heterozygote deficits were apparent. The analysis of molecular variance indicates that the percent of variance among populations and within populations were 6.73 and 93.27, respectively. The pairwise FST values between populations indicate that there were significant deviations in genetic differentiations for the red-tailed barb populations from these three Rivers of the Western Ghats, India. The microsatellites methods reported a low degree of gene diversity and lack of genetic heterogeneity in the population of G. curmuca, which strongly emphasize the need of fishery management, conservation and rehabilitation of G. curmuca.'\"], ['Abstract: \"Reducing carbon Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) is of central importance to combat climate change.

Despite the fact that these forests are located in relatively inaccessible areas, they are still under anthropogenic pressure leading to continued habitat degradation and loss of biomass and biodiversity. A case study was conducted in Mananvan shola, the largest shola forest in Kerala of Western Ghats, to recognize the impact of disturbance on vegetation structure, composition and regeneration pattern, to identify the socio-economic reasons for disturbance and to evolve strategies for its management. In the disturbed part of the forest, dominance of light demanding species in tree, shrub and herb communities has been recorded. Here even the dominance of exotic species in tree seedling, shrub and herb communities is prominent. Skewed girth class distribution of tree community with poor representation by the individuals of girth class 30.1 to 90.0 cm, is also an indication of the collection of small wood and poles from the forest. The RISQ (Ramakrishnan Index of Stand Quality) in the disturbed area of the forest is above 2.0 as against near to 1.0 in relatively undisturbed forest stands suggesting that the disturbance is intensive and thus natural recovery process would be slow. Socioeconomic analysis in villages located near the shola forest revealed the fact that the people depended heavily on this forest for their livelihood. Thus, the crux and the success of future management and conservation strategy depend on how one can reduce the dependency of people on the shola vegetation. Enrichment planting in disturbed parts of shola, enhancement of firewood by raising energy plantations, as well as development of lemongrass and firewood based agroforestry systems and reduction of grazing pressure by developing silvopastoral systems are the major strategies for the conservation of these shola forests.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Species richness and density of understory plants were investigated in eight plots, distributed one each in undisturbed and disturbed tropical evergreen, semi-evergreen, deciduous and littoral forests of Little Andaman island, India, which falls under one of the eight hottest hotspots of Biodiversity in the world viz. the Indo-Burma. One hundred quadrats were established in each plot, in which all the understory plants (that include herbs, undershrubs, shrubs and herbaceous climbers) were enumerated. The total density of understory plants was 6,812 individuals and species richness was 108 species, representing 104 genera and 50 families. Across the four forest types and eight study plots, the species richness ranged from 10 to All the disturbed sites harbored greater number of species than their undisturbed counterparts. Herbs dominated by species (63%) and density (4,259 individuals). The grass Eragrostis tenella (1,860 individuals; IVI 40), the invasive climber Mikania cordata (803; IVI 20) and the shrub Anaxagorea luzonensis (481; IVI 17.5) were the most abundant species. Poaceae, Asteraceae, Acanthaceae, Orchidaceae and Euphorbiaceae constituted the species-rich families represented by 6 species each. The species-area curves attained an asymptote at level except in sites DD and DL, indicating plot is not sufficient to capture all the understory species in disturbed forests. The alien weeds formed about one-fourth of the species richness (31 species; 28%) and density (1,926 individuals; 28.3%) in the study sites, indicating the extent of weed invasion and the attention required for effective conservation of the native biodiversity of the fragile island forest ecosystem.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The last four decades have seen an increasing integration of phylogenetics and biogeography. However, a dearth of phylogenetic studies has precluded such biogeographic analyses in South Asia until recently. Noting the increase in phylogenetic research and interest in phylogenetic biogeography in the region, we outline an integrative framework for studying taxon distribution patterns. While doing so, we pay particular attention to challenges posed by the complex geological and ecological history of the region, and the differences in distribution across taxonomic groups. We outline and compare three widely used phylogenetic biogeographic approaches: topology-based methods (TBMs), pattern-based methods (PBMs) and event-based methods (EBMs). TBMs lack a quantitative framework and utilize only part of the available phylogenetic information. Hence, they are mainly suited for preliminary enquiries. Both PBMs and EBMs have a quantitative framework, but we consider the latter to be particularly suited to the South Asian context since they consider multiple biogeographic processes explicitly, and can accommodate a reticulated history of areas. As an illustration, we present a biogeographic analysis of endemic Sri Lankan agamid lizards. The results provide insights into the relative importance of multiple processes and specific zones in the radiation of two speciose lizard clades.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The members of the genus Muntiacus are of particular interest to evolutionary biologists due to their extreme chromosomal rearrangements and the ongoing discussions about the number of living species.

Landslide database was generated using IRS-1C satellite LISS III data and aerial photographs accompanied by field investigations using differential global positioning system to generate a landslide inventory map. Topographical, spatial, and field data were processed to construct the spatial thematic layers using image processing and GIS environment. Twelve landslide-inducing factors were used for landslide vulnerability analysis: elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, proximity to road, drainage and lineament, land use/land cover, geology, geomorphology, and run-off. The first five factors were derived from digital elevation model, and other thematic layers were prepared from spatial database. Frequency ratio of each factor was computed using the above thematic factors with past landslide locations. Landslide vulnerability map was produced using raster analysis. The landslide vulnerability map was classified into five zones: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The model is validated using the relative landslide density index (R-index method).

The habitat linkage is crucial for large ranging animals such as elephants, which use these forest corridors for migration. Livestock grazing, a major biotic interference in forest corridors, originates from seven settlements of the Masinagudi group of villages on the eastern and the southeastern fringes of the sanctuary. Construction of a series of hydroelectric power stations, numbering about three at Singara, Marvakandy (Masinagudi) and Moyar, around the Masinagudi villages caused a rapid growth in human population (143% between 1961 and 1991), particularly the landless labourers and livestock. Free grazing by about 15 000 resident as well as migratory livestock every year in and around the forest corridors, coupled with removal of cattle dung from the forest floor, have adversely affected the forest regeneration and helped proliferation of weed species such as Lantana camara, Casia tora, C. occidentalis, Opuntia dillenii, and Ageratum conyzoides. The annual fodder production from the corridor forest could meet the demand of about two-thirds of the resident population, while the crop residues from the marginal agriculture could not support the remaining one-third livestock population. In view of such a situation, measures have been suggested to reduce livestock population and implement the ecodevelopment packages in order to ensure the corridor connectivity for the long-term conservation of the elephant population.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'India, a mega-diverse country, possesses a wide range of climate and vegetation types along with a varied topography.

Given the increase in the prevalence of isolated forest patches in the part of this hotspot, evaluation is necessary on how size of the remnant forest patches and on-going disturbances affects structure and diversity of remaining habitats including the population of some globally threatened tree species. Quantitative vegetation inventory by 500 m long and 10 m wide (0.5 ha) line transects were randomly set in nine fragmented tropical semi-evergreen forest patches in Tripura, Northeast India. The studied forests patches grouped into small, medium and large based on their respected sizes. Spatial variability was analysed in woody species diversity and structure along the patch size gradients and their response to both patch size and anthropogenic disturbances. Out of 167 species, 13 identified as red-listed species by IUCN under the present inventory. Most of the diversity and structural parameters showed statistically significant positive response with the forest patch size, except for stand dominance, disturbance, sapling density and number of aggregated distribution pattern decreased when patch size increased. In addition, most of the diversity and structural attributes showed negative response with disturbances. Present baseline data would serve as an effective tool for management and protection of this important forest type.

On the basis of canopy cover and frequency of disturbances (%), the studied forests were divided into highly disturbed (HD), moderately disturbed (MD) and least disturbed (LD) categories. The HD forests had the lowest canopy cover, lowest density and lowest TBC and the LD had the highest canopy cover, highest density and highest TBC. The MD forests occupied the intermediate position with respect to these parameters. Species richness was least in HD forests, highest in one of the MD forests while LD forest occupied an intermediate position. The percentage of regenerating species was lowest (54%) in HD and highest (72%) in MD. The density of seedlings and saplings was higher in one of the MD forests as compared to HD and LD. We concluded that the moderate disturbances do not affect the vegetation adversely; however the increased degree of disturbance causes loss in plant diversity; affects regeneration and changes community characteristics. Construction of hydroelectric projects at various places in the study area was found to be one of the most important sources of anthropogenic disturbances in addition to the routine anthropogenic disturbances like grazing, fuelwood collection and fodder extraction. If all proposed dams in the Indian Himalaya are constructed combined with weak national environmental impact assessment and implementation, it will result in a significant loss of species. Therefore, various agents of disturbances should be evaluated in cumulative manner and any developmental activities such as hydropower projects, which trigger various natural and anthropogenic disturbances, should be combined with proper cumulative environmental impact assessment and effective implementation to minimise the anticipated loss of vegetation.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The key aspect in planning and management of water resources is to analyze the runoff potential and erosion status of the river basin.

Cluster analyses using morphological features segregated species based mainly on their body shape and feeding parameters while habitat parameters segregated species according to their position along the water column and preference to runs or pool habitats. Principal component analyses showed that body size, head dimensions, mouth position and eye diameter were important characters for species segregation in morphological space while run or pool habitat type and the position of the fish in the water column best explained segregation of species in habitat space. Consistencies in some of the species clusters obtained from analyses on morphological characteristics and habitat preferences warrant closer examination of the relationships between them.

Apart from limiting the local livelihood options, the anticipated ecological consequences are not encouraging as exotic species are dominating the vegetation dynamics of the many native plant species. The fact is that the inextricable link between nature and society needs an integrated science-policy research approach for biodiversity conservation in the hotspots, particularly in the developing countries where human and ecosystem interactions are much more complex and closely interwoven with each other.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The Indian gene centre possesses a rich legume species comprising cultivated, underutilized edible and forage legumes. Majority of the underutilized food legumes are widely distributed as wild species in various agro-ecological regions of peninsular India. Indian legume species (62%) contribute to the food and health security of ethnic communities. A total of 66,546 accessions of legume gene resources including underutilized species are conserved in the National Gene Bank. Collection, characterization and conservation efforts regarding the diversity of these beans are described. The importance of genetic variation in legumes and their wild relatives as a source of desirable resistance to pests and diseases in a changing climate scenario is discussed. Information on legumes used in Indian and modern systems of medicine and ethno-botany as well as the scope for bio-prospecting are presented. Advanced biotechnological applications in legume research for sustainable utilization of these resources are highlighted.

The shoots initiated were subcultured to fresh media of the same composition for shoot multiplication and multiplied shoots were transferred to half strength MS hormone-free media for shoot elongation. The elongated shoots were then re-cultured to the media supplemented with 3.0 mg/L indole-3-butyric acid/4.0 mg/L NAA to raise plantlets which were subsequently analysed for genetic fidelity using inter simple sequence repeat markers. Out of 183 bands scored, 178 bands were monomorphic indicating 97.2% similarity. The observed low level of polymorphism between genotypes supports genetic consistency of these micro-clones that are likely to be genetically true to their parental origin. The clones thus obtained were hardened in the specially fabricated mist house at 29 and relative humidity for 3 months followed by shifting to green house for another 3 months of nursery establishment. The established plants when reintroduced to the selected forest segments of the Western Ghats, Kerala (India) showed 79.3% survival rate after 2 years of field transfer. The viable and highly reproducible in vitro cloning protocol demonstrated here for the first time can be used for the production of elite female clones for aforestation activities and sustained delivery of high quality raw materials to cane processing units for strengthening cane industry.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Liana diversity was inventoried in four tropical dry evergreen forest sites that are characterized by numerous trees, of short stature and small diameter, and a varying degree of anthropogenic disturbance, on the Coromandel coast of south India. A 1-ha plot was established in each of the four sites and was subdivided into 100 quadrats of 10 10 m. All lianas cm diameter at breast height (dbh) rooted within the plot were enumerated. The species richness and density of lianas, with respect to site disturbance and forest stature, varied across the sites. Liana density totaled 3307 individuals (range individuals and species richness totaled 39 species (range species representing 34 genera and 24 families. Combretaceae, Asclepiadaceae, Capparaceae and Vitaceae were the well-represented families. The top five species Strychnos minor, Combretum albidum, Derris ovalifolia, Jasminum angustifolium and Reissantia indica contributed 55% of total density. The slopes of the curves were different for each of the four sites and the curve stabilized in only one site. Of the four climbing modes recognized among the total 39 species, 18 were twiners (56% of the total density). Eight species (24% of density) were tendril climbers and 12 species (16% of density) were scramblers. Hugonia mystax was the only hook climber. All the 39 species and 88% of liana density were encountered within a category of 6 cm dbh or less, and a similar pattern prevailed in the individual sites. Of the three diaspore dispersal modes found among the 39 liana species, animal (64%) and wind (23%) dispersal were predominant over the autochorous mode (13%). Liana diversity and distribution in dry forest communities appear to be influenced by forest stature and site disturbance levels. In the light of the extent of liana diversity and sacred grove status of the study sites, the need for forest conservation, involving local people, is emphasized.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'This review deals with the forest vegetation of the Himalaya with emphasis on: paleoecological, phytogeographical, and phytosociological aspects of vegetation; structural and functional features of forest ecosystem; and relationship between man and forests.'\"], [\"Abstract: '1.

Natural forests and cardamom (planted under forest canopy) have been widely replaced by small-holder cultivation. Settlers plant cassava and other annuals in the initial years following clearing of the forest canopy. These crops are gradually replaced by black pepper, the dominant crop years after clearing. Finally, other perennial crops, planted during the period when pepper was dominant, mature. A highly mixed cropping phase is most common on sites years after the forest canopy was removed. Soil erosion on sites cleared years previously averaged 120 t/ha in the 1988 monsoon season. Over the same period, soil erosion under mature cardamom, pepper and mixed cultivation averaged 0.65, 3.5, and 1.45 t/ha respectively. Erosion levels appear to be related to cover at ground and intermediate m) heights above the surface. Soil organic matter is high in the cardamom areas, declines rapidly when the forest canopy is cleared, remains low in pepper, and appears to rebuild to levels as more mixed agroforestry systems become established. Overall, there appears to be a succession in which high erosion and declining organic matter levels are temporary features associated with the conversion of sites from forests and cardamom to other phases.'\"], ['Abstract: \"People\\'s participation is usually regarded as a sine qua non for the success and sustainability of development projects.

The plant biodiversity and population structure of woody plants (>20 cm girth at breast height; gbh) in two such groves, Oorani and Olagapuram, occurring on the north-west of Pondicherry have been analyzed. A total of 169 angiosperms have been enumerated from both sites. The Oorani grove (3.2 ha) had 74 flowering plant species distributed in 71 genera and 41 families; 30 of them are woody species, 8 are lianas and 4 are parasites. The Olagapuram grove (2.8 ha) was more species-rich with 136 species in 121 genera of 58 families; woody species were fewer (21) while 9 lianas and 3 parasites occurred. The vegetation structure indicates that the Oorani grove is a relic of tropical dry evergreen forest, whereas Olagapuram is reduced to a thorny woodland. The latter is heavily degraded as it has lost the status of a sacred grove because of its conversion to Eucalyptus plantations. The Oorani grove has an Amman temple in the centre.

A survey was conducted to assess the status of a reportedly unexplored B. monosperma forest in a narrow strip of land along the northeastern region of Pakistan in order to conserve the remaining remnants. A preliminary reconnaissance survey on the basis of land use divides the narrow stretch of land, with concentration of remnants into four zones. The remnants were further evaluated for in situ conservation by a scoring system based on vegetation analysis and quality of habitat. Low value was assigned to those criteria which had negative impact and high to those which had positive impact on performance of B. monosperma and its long-term survival. Additional information, pertaining to decline, trends of change in the land use, and the underlying socioeconomic processes, was also made. Information from the study area indicated that, in the past two decades, the decline and conversion of the remaining B. monosperma forest to agriculture and forestry has been intensified. The vegetation analysis revealed that all remnants are broadly B. vasica, bispecies association. The scoring system ranked the remnants into four classes. Two forests from the intact remnant class and one from the mildly degraded class were recommended for in situ conservation. Keeping in view the deteriorating status of the highly ranked remnants across the landscape and the degree of alteration it is undergoing, they were assigned the conservation status category of An approach suggested for their immediate conservation was to fence them, with open access to the local people for sustainable resource use.

Exploitation of the tubers and poor regeneration from seed has narrowed distribution and propagation of the species. There is a need to develop in vitro propagation methods for C. karulensis to alleviate these problems. Here, we optimized callus induction, somatic embryogenesis and microtuberization from different seedling explants viz. cotyledonary leaf and root. The environmental scanning electron microscopy was used to observe somatic embryonic origin and their developmental stages. Highest callus proliferation was recorded with 6-benzylaminopurine and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Somatic embryos derived from cotyledonary leaf explants were more proliferative than root explants. The combination of 6-benzylaminopurine, naphthalene acetic acid and 7% sucrose in MS media resulted in highest microtuberization. Further, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based metabolic profiling was carried out from native wild plants and in vitro callus tissues which identified various phytochemicals such as alkaloids, fatty acids, esters alcohols, etc. Multivariate analysis revealed the chemical disparities, where considerable variations were observed between native wild type and in vitro tissues, but no significant differences were found among in vitro callus from both root and cotyledonary explants.

We examined whether these factors influenced DPL and home range use in a group of endemic lion-tailed macaques (Macaca silenus) in the selectively logged forests of Sirsi-Honnavara in the central Western Ghats Mountains of south India. We predicted that monthly rainfall, fruit tree density, number of plant species eaten, intergroup encounters, and terrestriality would correlate with DPL, and fruit tree density, overall tree density, and richness of fruiting tree species would correlate with home range use. We collected data on feeding ecology from scan sampling, and DPL and home range use by recording the geo-coordinates of the focal group with a handheld GPS during daily follows. We obtained 1230 h of observations over 24 mo between 2008 and 2011. We collected data on the density of food species and of all trees using the point-centered quarter method in 1-ha grid cells overlaid on the home range of the study group. Results showed that the mean monthly DPL correlated positively with the number of trees fruiting in a month and negatively with rainfall. Overall tree density and fruit tree density correlated positively with habitat use. These findings support the hypothesis that primary food resources are a major determinant of primate ranging patterns.

In a bubble chamber incubation of leaf litter, 16 and 9 species were recovered from Kaiga stream and Kadra dam with high spore output (1122 versus 324 spores per mg dry mass) and high Shannon diversity in Kaiga stream. Both direct and indirect methods of examination of fecal pellets of fishes revealed more species in Kaiga stream than Kadra dam versus species). The spore release in leaf litter incubated with fecal pellets ranged from 2.3 to 98 with the highest Aplocheilus lineatus in Kaiga stream; while in Kadra dam, it was from 0.02 to 22.9 with the highest in Puntius filamentosus. The Shannon diversity of aquatic hyphomycetes was high in fecal pellets of Aplocheilus lineatus of Kaiga stream and Rasbora daniconius of Kadra dam. The top-ranked five species of aquatic hyphomycetes differed in water, leaf litter, and fish fecal pellets; however, Triscelophorus konajensis was common for all.

East of the Indian mainland (the Eastern coast, EC) are the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (AN, about away at the shortest distance), which exhibit a great plant diversity, with 848 unique species. West of the Indian mainland (the Western Ghats, WG) are another group of islands, the Lakshadweep Islands (LD, about away at the shortest distance), which exhibit less diversity (102 unique species) than do the AN. We compared these two pairs which exhibit different insular isolation conditions, to understand the plant dispersal mechanisms and their determining predictors (plant richness, geographic area, perimeter, elevation, and shortest distance). We found epizoochory (adherence to an animal surface), ornithochory (birds), and hydrochory (water) to be the dominant dispersers of both the pairs. Additionally, the plant dispersal in the pair is predominantly driven by anemochory (wind), possibly denoting the effects of the northeasterly trade winds. The major role of biotic dispersers in the pair may be explained as resulting from plant dispersal to more remote islands through biotic dispersers being more rapid and efficient. The plant commonality was found to be positively correlated with the plant richness, geographic area, and perimeter; whereas it was negatively correlated with the shortest distance and elevation of the selected pairs. Both linear and non-linear regression with maximum accuracy found island plant richness, geographic area, and shortest distance to the nearest mainland pool to be the determinants in explaining plant-dispersal mechanisms. These predictors are important to maintain the habitat suitability and connectivity and thereby support more newly dispersed plants.

However, several major rivers and their tributaries arise in the Himalayan ranges and are fed by thousands of glaciers. Huge sediment loads carried by these rivers result in important deltas at their mouths. The climatic and physiographic diversity have endowed the region with many kinds of wetlands. Of these, the peatswamps of southeast Asia constitute about 56% of the tropical peatlands, and more than 42% of the mangroves occur in South and southeast Asia. Among other wetlands, riverine swamps are rather restricted whereas the seasonal marshes are a dominant feature. Another characteristic feature of tropical Asia are the innumerable human-made and intensively managed wetlands of which the paddy fields and aquaculture ponds are the most extensive. Throughout tropical Asia, wetlands have been a part of the socio-cultural ethos of the people and many communities have lived in wetlands. However, the pressures of high population and the economic development have extensively impacted upon wetlands which have been transformed for paddy cultivation and aquaculture, drained and converted to other land uses for economic gains (e.g., conversion to oil palm), and degraded by discharge of domestic and industrial wastes. Invasive plant and animal species have also played a significant role. The climate change is already being felt in the rapid retreat of Himalayan glaciers, increased temperature and variability in precipitation as well as the frequency of extreme events. Sea level rise is seen as a major threat to the coastal wetlands, particularly the mangroves. Increasing droughts have caused frequent fires in Indonesian peat swamps that have further feedback impacts on regional climate. However, the actual threat to wetlands in this region arises from the extensive hydrological alterations being caused by storage, abstraction and diversion of river flows for agriculture, industry and hydropower. Currently, the state of our understanding wetlands in general, and the efforts and infrastructure for research and training in wetlands are very poor. Although a few wetlands have been designated as Ramsar sites, the policies aimed at wetland conservation are either non-existent or very weak. Human responses to greater uncertainty and variability in the available water resources in different parts of Asia will be crucial to the conservation of wetlands in the future.'\"], ['Abstract: Abstract not available'], [\"southern India'\"], [\"Abstract: 'With growing human and, possibly, elephant populations and a drastic increase in anthropogenic activities, conflict in Asia has been on the rise. The Alur area in Karnataka state, southern India, is one such case in point, which has witnessed increasing levels of conflict over the last two decades. The tiny, moderately protected habitat available for elephants in this human-dominated landscape does not appear to be able to support elephants over the long term. Options to deal with the escalating conflict include translocation of elephants, bringing elephants into captivity, and culling. We carried out a molecular genetic study of elephants in the Alur area to estimate the minimum number of elephants using the area, the sex ratio, genetic relatedness between individuals, and genetic structure with regard to the larger population in the landscape, so that informed management decisions could be made. Fresh dung samples were collected from the field and genotyped using 12 microsatellite loci. We found 29 unique individuals in the population, comprising 17 females and 12 males of different age classes. Relatedness between females suggested independent colonisations by discrete, small groups rather than by one cohesive clan of related females. This obviates the need for a single solution for dealing with all the females in the area in order to maintain social integrity, and has implications in terms how these elephants can be dealt with. We demonstrate how social organization inferred through molecular data from non-invasive sampling can inform management decisions.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Extensive surveys were conducted to explore the diversity of fishes, distribution patterns, abundance, threat, and habitat status in the upper, middle, and lower stretch of river Gomti, a tributary of river Ganga.

The present study provides the first detailed and comprehensive ecological data on the Siberut macaque (Macaca siberu), a primate species living exclusively on the island of Siberut off the west coast of Sumatra. Our results show that M. siberu is ecologically similar to its closest relative M. nemestrina occurring on the mainland, both species being semi-terrestrial, mainly frugivorous (75-76%), exhibit a large daily travel distance for their group size and spend more time on traveling than any other macaque species. The habitat of Siberut macaques was floristically very diverse index D=0.97), although somewhat impoverished in tree species richness, and had a lower tree basal area and a lower rattan density compared to other forests in Malesia (both rattan and palm tree fruit being an important food resource for Macaca siberu due to their long fruiting periods). These factors may lead to a lower diversity and abundance of fruit resources, and coupled with a high degree of frugivory of Siberut macaques, may explain the large amount of traveling observed in this species. The large home range requirements and strong dependence on fruit are important factors that need to be considered when developing conservation measures for this IUCN-listed (Category Vulnerable) species.'\"], [\"and species composition'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Sustainable extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has recently gained considerable attention as a means to enhance rural incomes and conserve tropical forests. However, there is little information on the amounts of products collected per unit area and the impact of extraction on forest structure and composition. In this paper we estimate the quantities of selected products gathered by the Soligas, the indigenous people in the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) sanctuary in Karnataka, India, and examine the effect of extraction on forest structure and composition. Two sites, distant (DS) and proximal (PS), were identified based on the proximity to a Soliga settlement. The frequency of different size classes indicates that regeneration overall is poor in the area. The two sites show differences in species richness, basal area, and tree mortality. Furthermore, non-timber forest product species show a greater deficit of small size classes than the timber forest species, suggesting that regeneration is affected by collection of seeds and fruits from non-timber forest product species. Regeneration, however, may also be affected by other anthropogenic pressures such as fire, grazing and competition with weeds.'\"], [\"Abstract: ''\"], [\"Abstract: 'In the present study, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method namely inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) was employed to assess genetic stability in tissue culture-derived Dictyospermum ovalifolium plantlets.

A total of 51 clear and reproducible bands ranging from 200 bp to 2.1 kb were scored corresponding to an average of 3.64 bands per primer. Two of the 51 bands were polymorphic (3.92 %) among 14 individuals, thus indicating the occurrence of low level genomic variation in the micropropagated plants. Cluster analysis indicates that genetic similarity values were 0.978 which allows classification of the plants to distinct groups.

A total of distributed over five, 3-ha permanent plots in five sites, differing in degree of disturbance, were used to enumerate and measure the tree species. A total of 65 species with 136,983 individuals were enumerated in the total 15-ha area for stems height. The number of species and number of stems ranged from 12 to 50 and 3-ha area. The number of species and stems for trees ranged from 3 to 28 species, with a mean value of 16 species and from 16 to 477 stems, with a mean value of 256 stems respectively. The adult based PCA ordination indicated uniqueness of sites in terms of species composition and habitat characteristics. PCA ordination also showed uniqueness of sites in terms of seedling composition, but the seedling and adult distributions were not spatially associated. The distinct species composition at the different sites and at the two life-cycle stages on the same site is indicative of marked spatio-temporal dynamics of the dry tropical forest. The semi-logarithmic curves ranged from a near linear to an overall concave appearance with a limited plateau in the mid-diameter ranges. The and its components decreased with increasing disturbance intensity, reflecting enhanced utilization pressure with increasing disturbance. The site-wise and species-wise regression analyses of the number of individuals in different stages of the species revealed that both the level of disturbance and the nature of species strongly affect the regeneration. In conclusion, although the forest is relatively species-poor, the differential species composition on different sites and the temporal dynamics lend a unique level of diversity to the tropical dry deciduous forest.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'A potentially diagnostic 18S rDNA (ribosomal DNA) gene was amplified reliably from red-listed ethnomedicinal species of Myristica and its wild and related genera. Individuals from nine species of Myristicaceae were utilized for the study. The sequences ranged from 1,767 to 1,794 nucleotide (nt) in length. The GC content (%) varied from 52.77 to 51.04. The frequencies (%) of nt were A (23.31), T (23.82), C (24.48) and G (28.39). The alignment of all sequences produced 195/1,516 variable sites and 1,257/1,516 conserved sites. Total numbers of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites found in the alignment were 146/1,516. Knema andamanica (Warb.) W.J. de Wilde was the most distinct that included 18 variable regions and 15 InDel with 27 SNP sites, specific to this species. The identified regions from nine species of Myristica and its wild and closely related genera were deposited in the GenBank Database (Accession numbers JN228257-JN228265). Comparison of morphological identifications and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the specimens were correctly assigned on the basis of a short stretch of 18S rDNA making this a potentially useful marker for the rapid molecular assignment of an unknown related species also. Significant sequence homology ranging from 72 to was observed on comparison with 18S rDNA genes of other plants in the public domain. A comparison of intraspecific data information of nine 18S with that of 73 matK and 86 rbcL sequences from GenBank revealed that polymorphism, divergence and conservation is higher in 18S locus for Myristicaceae. Hence these markers may be utilized for phylogenetic analysis, evaluation of species richness during ecological surveys or for environmental assessments. These molecular markers are especially important due to the fact that the species studied are mostly vulnerable and red-listed with limited availability in endangered ecological niches.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The process of forest fragmentation, a common phenomenon occurring in tropical forests, not only results into continuously forest getting fragmented but also brings about several physical and biological changes in the environment of forests. Consequently, there is a loss of biodiversity due to change in habitat conditions. These remnant fragments provide the last hope for biodiversity conservation. The present study deals with the impact of decreasing patch size of a fragmented forest on the diversity of the tropical dry deciduous forests in Vindhyan highlands, India. There is considerable change in the vegetation cover of this region owing to rapid industrialization and urbanization, which has also contributed to forest fragmentation. In the present study, remotely sensed data has been used to describe the changes brought about in vegetated areas over a period of as a result of fragmentation and its impact on biodiversity was assessed. Further, in order to assess the loss of species with respect to the reduction in patch size, species area curves for various change areas were analysed. It was observed that the rate of decrease in the number of species is faster in the case of negative change areas as compared to the positive change areas of the region. Various diversity indices also support this observation.

Conservation efforts that focus on poverty alleviation, work on the premise that an increase in household wealth decreases use of forest resources. We surveyed 1222 households across four tiger reserves to test the paradigm that an increase in assets leads to reduced forest use and we also assess the effects of other socio-economic factors. We find that increase in assets may reduce Non-timber Forest Product (NTFP) collection, but may not necessarily reduce livestock numbers or use of wood as a cooking fuel. Households that faced more economic setbacks were more likely to state that they wanted more livestock in the future. Education is positively associated with choosing Liquefied Petroleum Gas as a cooking fuel in the future. We find site and resource-specific variation. Fifty percent of all households (range across sites: want to collect NTFP while 91% (range: want to retain or own more livestock over the next Understanding current and future resource use will help plan context-specific conservation efforts that are better aligned with reducing specific pressures around protected areas.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Whereas much attention is paid to the conservation and management of threatened species of primates, little work is reported on the species that are at lower risk.

The population has suffered an overall decline of 21.3% (at an intrinsic rate (r) of with Dry Cultivation habitat alone recording over 41% decline in 14 years. The Dry Cultivation habitat has also shown increased population fragmentation due to increased distance among groups, and decreased numbers of individuals per subpopulation. In Dry Cultivation areas, the number of small groups has been increasing, whereas the number of medium and large groups has been decreasing. We discuss such trends in the context of human-monkey conflict for shared resources. We propose that effective conservation strategies for lower risk species, especially if they are by-and-large commensal, must be planned now before they become threatened. We further propose that Scrub Forests with places of worship, and with the least human-monkey conflict but otherwise close to intensively used human habitats, are the most suitable and stable habitats for conservation of bonnet macaques.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Focal species are valuable tools for evaluating management practices for biodiversity conservation. Butterfly gardening through the creation of appropriate habitats can be a primary conservation tool to increase species abundance and richness and gene flow among the populations in fragmented landscapes. In this context, the role of butterfly gardens in the conservation of butterfly populations and the seasonal population trends of swallowtail butterflies (family Papilionidae) sighted in the Butterfly Safari Park at Thenmala were studied.

Demographic parameters were estimated for 11 groups in 8 rain forest fragments, during January to May 1996. Area, tree density, canopy cover, canopy height, and tree basal area were estimated for these fragments. As fragment area decreased, there was a decline in birth rate and proportion of immatures in the group, and an increase in the number of adult males, and the variability in group size and adult sex ratios. A similar pattern was also observed with decreasing values of other habitat variables. Differences in the founder population size and age structure, demographic randomness, and history of poaching have caused greater variability in group size and adult sex ratios in the small fragments.

The fewest species (11) were seen at a degraded mangrove site near the river mouth, and the greatest number (150) in the rich semi-evergreen forest on Tungar Hill. For all sites there were 141 tree, 25 shrub and 15 liana species, a total of 181 species. Excluding the mangrove site, which had no species in common with the other 14 sites, we analyzed the species distributions in detail. These sites ranged in area from 4 to 30 km2 each, had woody floras of 89 6 species, and varied in intensity of human impact. Despite a history of exploitation and substantial reduction in biomass from firewood collecting, set fires and illicit tree felling, considerable plant diversity remains in the area. We found a modest increase in species richness in transects away from two villages. We observed the exploitation of the forest by the principal users, primarily of the Warli Tribe. They exploited a wide variety of forest resources (92 species), for medicines, foods, construction materials, household goods, manure and other purposes. They collected 15 items for sale. By far the single most important item collected was firewood, which dramatically reduced forest biomass within 2 km of villages. The species distributions in these forest remnants are strongly nested, mostly due to varying degrees of disturbance at individual sites. The high species diversity on Tungar Hill is most likely a relict of the earlier character of forests throughout much of the valley.

In that perspective, the present study documents the global diversity of a component of the soil macrofauna, the land planarians, and concerns an exploratory analysis of their possible role as indicators of biodiversity.

The biodiversity measures of species richness and range-size rarity show a great correspondence in the identification of hotspots of diversity; both measures identify the following seven areas as the most biodiverse for land planarians: Sao Paulo, Florianopolis, western Java, Tasmania, Sri Lanka, North Island/New Zealand, and Sydney. It is discussed to what extent the results for the land planarians correspond with those obtained in other studies that assessed biodiversity hotspots for taxa on a global scale. It is noteworthy that land planarians identify a few global hotspots of diversity that generally do not feature, or only have low rankings, in other studies: New Zealand, southeastern Australia, and Tasmania.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The use of paddock trees by birds was assessed in a grazinglandscape in southern New South Wales, Australia.

Several site and landscapevariables were measured at each site. These included tree species, atree size index, a measure of the crown cover density around the site,and proximity to the nearest woodland patch. During formal surveys, 31bird species, including several woodland species, were observed usingpaddock trees. Data from bird surveys in woodland patches that wereobtained in a separate study in November 1999 were used to comparewhether there was a relationship between the abundance of a given birdspecies in woodland patches and paddock trees. Many birds commonlydetected in woodland patches were also common in paddock trees. However,some birds with special habitat requirements were absent from paddocktrees although they were common in woodland patches.

Nectarivores appeared to bemore likely to be detected at sites more than 200 m fromwoodland, although this result was marginally non-significant(P = 0.08). The probability of detecting granivoreswas higher at sites with a low tree size index.

Species that are on the brink of extinction because of the rapid loss of genetic diversity and habitat come mainly from resource-poor areas of the world and from global biodiversity hotspots and island countries. These species are unique because they are endemic, and only a few small populations or sometimes only a few individuals remain in the wild. Therefore, the challenges to support conservation by in vitro measures are many and varied. The editors of this invited issue solicited papers from experts from Asia, Africa, Europe, Australia, and North and South America.

The prevalence of T. procumbens in central regions of India could demonstrate its greater dependencies on precipitation seasonality and radiation than that on temperature. These discrepancies in climatic dependencies allowed both for a harmonious distribution, i.e., inhabiting in regions not utilised by other. Both are likely to reduce their potential distribution areas in the future climate, where moisture availability is a key factor for their range expansion. The capacity to tolerate a wide range of temperature and solar radiation allowed T. procumbens to manage climate change impacts more efficiently, compared with C. odorata. The present study reveals harmony in their distributions and suggests distinct conservation protocols for each of them to control their invasion risks.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'A primary need in conserving species and their habitats is defining distinct genetic entities that range from individuals to species to ecosystems and beyond.

At least 100 of them have been subjected to scientific studies. Habitat variables responsible for a reservoir\\'s productivity can be summed up into climatic, morphometric and hydro-edaphic factors. The peninsular reservoirs are characterized by a narrow range of fluctuations in water and air temperature across seasons, a phenomenon which prevents the formation of thermal stratification. Many reservoirs in the upper peninsula show thermal stratification during summer. Wind-induced turbulence facilitates the return of nutrients to the trophogenic zone. Most reservoirs on the mountain slopes of Western Ghats, Himalayas and the other highlands are deeper, with steeper basin walls, compared to irrigation impoundments. Mean depth does not show any direct correlation with productivity, either at primary or fish level. A high shoreline development index gives a better indication of productivity. Plankton, benthos and periphyton pulses of Indian reservoirs coincide with the months of least level fluctuations. Oligotrophic tendencies shown by some reservoirs are mainly due to poor nutrient status and other chemical deficiencies. In most cases, poor water quality is accountable to poor catchment soil. Low levels of phosphate and nitrate are not indicative of low productivity due to quick recycling of these nutrients. Specific conductivity reflects the production propensities of reservoirs satisfactorily. Almost all productive reservoirs have a klinograde oxygen curve and a vertical stratification of chemical variables such as pH, carbon dioxide, total alkalinity and specific conductivity. High seasonal rainfall and discharge of water during monsoon result in high flushing rates, which do not favour colonization by macrophytic communities. Similarly, inadequate availability of suitable substrata retards the growth of periphyton. Plankton constitutes the major link in the trophic structure. A rich plankton community with well-marked succession is the hallmark of Indian reservoirs with blue-green algae as the major component. The main factors that retard the growth of benthos are a rocky bottom, frequent water level fluctuation and rapid deposition of silt and other suspended particles. Large reservoirs, on average, harbour 60 species of fishes, of which at least 40 contribute to the commercial fisheries. Fast-growing Indian major carps are the prominent commercial fishes. Dam construction has adversely affected populations of many other species such as Tenualosa ilisha, Torspp. and Cirrhinus spp. Formulae for estimating fish yield potential and stocking density are described. While culture-based fisheries have been successfully practiced in many small reservoirs, the management norm followed in medium and large reservoirs is primarily on capture fishery. In large and medium reservoirs, stocking was successful only when stocked fishes bred. Indian experience on species enhancement and introductions is described. Environmental enhancement of small reservoirs has been attempted in some reservoirs of Tamil Nadu. Modeling, using standard population parameters, such as the density-dependent growth, size dependent mortalityand relationshipis discussed. Two exotic fishes viz., Oreochromis mossambicus and Cyprinus carpio have been introduced into Indian reservoir with discouraging results. Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, after an accidental introduction, has performed well in Gobindsagar, a reservoir with a distinct cold water regime.

All the tree species examined had AM association. AM and DSE colonization is reported for the first time in 20 and 14 species respectively. Cooccurrence of AM and DSE was observed in 14 (40%) tree species. The extent of DSE colonization was inversely related to the extent of AM fungal colonization. Six tree species had Arum-type, 18 had intermediatetype and 11 had typical Paris-type AM morphology. AM fungal spore morphotypes belonging to 11 species in two genera were isolated from the rhizosphere soil. AM fungal spore numbers were not related to the extent of AM colonization and Glomus dominated spore diversity. AM association individually and along with DSE were found respectively in the 63% and 44% of the economically important tree species.

It is imperative to understand how species are distributed spatially and temporally in and outside reserves, and what factors influence their occurrence. This study surveyed landscape surrounding five reserves in the Western Ghats to examine patterns of occurrence of five herbivores: elephant, gaur, sambar, chital, and pig. Species distributions are modeled spatio-temporally using an occupancy approach. Trained field teams conducted 3860 interview-based occupancy surveys in a 10-km buffer surrounding these five reserves in 2012. I found gaur and wild pig to be the least and most wide-ranging species, respectively. Elephant and chital exhibit seasonal differences in spatial distribution unlike the other three species. As predicted, distance to reserve, the reserve itself, and forest cover were associated with higher occupancy of all species, and higher densities of people negatively influenced occurrence of all species. Park management, species protection, and conflict mitigation efforts in this landscape need to incorporate temporal and spatial understanding of species distributions. All species are known crop raiders and conflict prone locations with resources (such as water and forage) have to be monitored and managed carefully. Wildlife reserves and adjacent areas are critical for long-term persistence and habitat use for all five herbivores and must be monitored to ensure wildlife can move freely. Such a large-scale approach to map and monitor species distributions can be adapted to other landscapes to identify and monitor critical habitats shared by people and wildlife.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The diversity of Indian lichen flora has undergone a considerable decline in the last five decades. Among the various anthropogenic activities, overexploitation and selective removal of economically important lichens have become major threats to the lichen flora of the country.

The western Himalayas proved to be the main area for lichen collection, while some lichen species also come from the central and Western Ghats. Local traders coordinate the lichen collection and then sell the material to traders in the foothills, and from there it is processed and distributed to other parts of the country and abroad.

Results indicate the species relationship between Bird species richness (BSR) and elevation sections (forest habitats) was not decline simultaneously along elevation; it shows hump shaped. BSR varied considerably along elevational gradient (43 to 62 species), was highest (62 species) at mid elevation (Mixed pine forest, m asl) and decreased (20 species) at high elevation (Conifer forest, m asl). It seems that mid altitude bulge is not caused by the presence of a group of mid altitude specialists but rather that there is an overlap in the distribution of low land and high elevation specialists at this altitude. A checklist of 79 avian species has also produced of Nainital district forest habitats.

Two dominant haplotypes were distributed over the entire range of this species in India and several private haplotypes were found. Low genetic diversity within population, high differentiation, number of population specific haplotypes and deviation from neutral evolution characterized the present populations of S. laurina. An analysis of molecular variance indicated the presence of geographic structure within the haplotype distribution. The occurrence of S. laurina preglaciation in India is the most parsimonious explanation for the current geographic structure observed.

The land use land cover (LULC) map of of river stretch for buffer radii of in Varanasi revealed that riparian vegetation is negligible in the district. The hierarchical cluster analysis of LULC data suggested that there are two major land use categories, viz., urban and agriculture. The land use wise principal component analysis (PCA) suggested that urbanized areas are major contributor of metals, whereas agricultural land contributes organic matter into the river. The Spearman correlation study revealed that with rising urbanization, the pollutant load into the river increased compared to that from agricultural land use.

There is a more realistic hope of reaching agreement on the number of recognizable subspecies. The latter objective is more urgent because in order to reliably assess generic and specific numbers, it is essential that effective conservation measures are implemented for as many subspecies as possible. This cannot be comprehensively accomplished until their validity is assessed and they are satisfactorily established and defined. The Asian primate classification that we present is the outcome of electronic communication among the co-authors after a workshop, which was especially convened to attempt to determine the number of recognizable primate subspecies and to identify potentially recognizable subspecies. The generic and specific arrangement is a compromise that does not necessarily reflect the individual views of the co-authors: 183 subspecies in 77 species in 16 genera.

The Dipterocarpaceae is a dominant Southeast Asian family of tree species of global significance for the tropical timber industry. Very little information exists about how effective human modified landscapes are for conserving genetic diversity in dipterocarp species. This study provides a baseline for understanding how fragmented agro-forest landscapes in India sustain forest genetic resources in an endemic dipterocarp tree. We compare genetic diversity and fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) in the threatened tree species Vateria indica within an isolated and a continuous forest site in the Western Ghats, South India. We place these results in the context of dipterocarps from both the Seychelles and Borneo. Parentage analysis of 694 progeny using twelve nuclear microsatellite markers is applied to estimate pollen and seed dispersal. Using a nursery trial we evaluate effects of inbreeding on growth performance. Our results show that levels of FSGS, and gene dispersal are comparable between a small isolated and a large continuous site of V. indica. Realized long-distance pollen flow into the isolated patch appears to help maintaining genetic diversity. The nursery experiment suggests that selection favours outbred progeny. Individuals of V. indica in close proximity appear less related to each other than in another highly fragmented and endangered dipterocarp species from the Seychelles, but more related than in three dipterocarp species studied in continuous forest in Borneo.

These statistical relations are estimated based on historical observations at the finer resolutions and used for future projections. The implicit assumption is that the SD relations, extracted from data are stationary or remain unaltered, despite non-stationary change in climate. The validity of this assumption relates directly to the credibility of SD. Falsifiability of climate projections is a challenging proposition. Calibration and verification, while necessary for SD, are unlikely to be able to reproduce the full range of behavior that could manifest at decadal to century scale lead times. We propose a design-of-experiments (DOE) strategy to assess SD performance under nonstationary climate and evaluate the strategy via a transfer-function based SD approach. The strategy relies on selection of calibration and validation periods such that they represent contrasting climatic conditions like hot-versus-cold and ENSO-versus-non-ENSO years. The underlying assumption is that conditions such as warming or predominance of El may be more prevalent under climate change. In addition, two different historical time periods are identified, which resemble pre-industrial and the most severe future emissions scenarios. The ability of the empirical relations to generalize under these proxy conditions is considered an indicator of their performance under future nonstationarity. Case studies over two climatologically disjoint study regions, specifically India and Northeast United States, reveal robustness of DOE in identifying the locations where nonstationarity prevails as well as the role of effective predictor selection under nonstationarity.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'A morphometric evaluation of Tamiraparani subbasin was carried out to determine the drainage characteristics using GIS model technique.

The developed model reveals that the drainage area of this subbasin is and shows subdendritic to dendritic drainage pattern. The basin includes seventh order stream and mostly dominated by lower stream order. The slope of the study area varies from in the east to towards west. The presence of Western Ghats is the chief controlling factor for slope variation. Moreover, the slope variation is controlled by the local lithology and erosion cycles.

Historically, species were considered as varieties bound together by reproduction. After over 200 years of uncertainty, Mayr attempted to bring coherence to the definition of species through the biological species concept (BSC). This has, however, received much criticism, and the last half century has spawned at least 20 other concepts. A central philosophical problem is that concepts treat species as while the criteria for categorization treats them as While not getting away from this problem entirely, the GLC attempts to provide a framework where lineage divergence is influenced by a number of different factors (and correlated to different traits) which relate to the different species concepts. We also introduce an probabilistic approach for understanding and delimiting species. Finally, we provide a Wallacean (geography related) approach to the Linnaean problem of identifying and delimiting species, particularly for cases of allopatric divergence, and map this to the GLC. Going one step further, we take a morphometric terrain approach to visualizing and understanding differences between lineages. In summary, we argue that while generalized frameworks may work well for concepts of what species are, plurality and probabilistic approaches may work best for delimitation.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'This article focuses on the relationship between priority-setting in conservation and in taxonomy.

A totalof 70 paddock tree sites was surveyed for 20 min each inthe morning, and 36 sites were surveyed again in the afternoon in March2000. During the surveys, the presence, direction of arrival, anddirection of departure to and from sites was recorded for each bird. Astepping stone effect of paddock trees was examined in two ways: (1) byanalysing the arrival and departure direction of birds relative tosurrounding vegetation cover, and (2) by analysing the departuredirection of birds relative to their arrival direction. An arrivaldirection was obtained for 150 independently acting groups of birds, anda departure direction was obtained for 203 independently acting groupsof birds. Both arrival and departure direction were obtained for 87independently acting groups. Foliage-foraging birds tended to followrelatively densely vegetated areas. There was some indication thatgranivores and nectarivores also preferred to move along denselyvegetated areas. This trend was absent for open-country species. Allgroups of birds examined tended to return to their place of origin ormove in the opposite direction of their arrival. This trend was mostpronounced for nectarivores and the foliage-foraging White-plumedHoneyeater (Lichenostomus penicillatus), and lesspronounced for open-country species and parrots. The results arediscussed in relation to the biology and ecology of the various speciesof birds.

Numerous sacred sites are found between 1900 and and at higher elevations the area as a whole is considered a sacred landscape. Religious beliefs may affect the ecology of these sacred areas, resulting in unique ecological characteristics of importance to conservation; recent studies have demonstrated that sacred areas can often play a major role in conservation. The goal of this study is to preliminarily analyze the vegetation of sacred areas in the Menri region using existing vegetation maps and a Geographical Information System (GIS) for remote assessment. Sacred sites are compared to random points in the landscape, in terms of: elevation, vegetation, and nearness to villages; species composition, diversity, and richness; and frequency of useful and endemic plant species. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) ordination reveals that sacred sites differ significantly in both useful species composition (p=0.034) and endemic species composition (p=0.045). Sacred sites are located at lower elevations, and closer to villages, than randomly selected, non-sacred sites and have higher overall species richness (p=0.033) and diversity (p=0.042). In addition, the high-elevation areas of the mountain - a sacred landscape - are found to have significantly more endemics than low-elevation areas (p<0.0001).

Forested areas in the lower western Himalaya in India constitute the headwater catchments for many hill streams and have experienced degradation in forest cover due to grazing, deforestation and other human activities. This change in forest cover is likely to alter the soil moisture regime and, consequently, flow regimes in streams. The effect of change in forest cover on soil moisture regimes of this dry region has not been studied through long term field observations. We monitored soil matric potentials in two small watersheds in the lower western Himalaya of India. The watersheds consisted of homogeneous land covers of moderately dense oak forest and moderately degraded mixed oak forest. Observations were recorded at three sites at three depths in each watershed at fortnightly intervals for a period of three years. The soil moisture contents derived from soil potential measurements were analyzed to understand the spatial, temporal and profile variations under the two structures of forest cover. The analysis revealed large variations in soil moisture storage at different sites and depths and also during different seasons in each watershed. Mean soil moisture storage during monsoon, winter and summer seasons was higher under dense forest than under degraded forest. Highest soil moisture content occurred at shallow soil profiles, decreasing with depth in both watersheds. A high positive correlation was found between tree density and soil moisture content. Mean soil moisture content over the entire study period was higher under dense forest than under degraded forest. This indicated a potential for soil water storage under well managed oak forest. Because soil water storage is vital for sustenance of low flows, attention is needed on the management of oak forests in the Himalayan region.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'In the context of over-consumption of natural resources in the name of development and rapid industrialization by a small section of the human population that is rapidly growing, the world is currently faced with a variety of environmental uncertainties. covering a whole variety of ecological issues, and in an economic sense, are two major phenomena that are responsible for these uncertainties. There is increasing evidence to suggest that the developing countries more than the developed, particularly the marginalized traditional (those living close to nature and natural resources) societies would be the worst sufferers. In order to cope with this problem in a situation where the traditional societies have to cope with rapidly depleting biodiversity on which they are dependant for their livelihood, there is an urgent need to explore additional pathways for sustainable management of natural resources and societal development. Such pathways should be based on a landscape management strategy, that takes into consideration the rich traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) that these societies have.

The article contends that the broad goal of making Pushkar paradise, and more specifically, the task of cleaning the lake, involves a robust process of ritualization. Thinking alongside the work of Catherine Bell, the article aims to show how environmentalism becomes ritualized, and in turn renders a place sacred.

A stratified random sampling scheme was used to survey the distribution and abundance of the species across a 3500 ha area around the village. Data on the physical environment as well as the geographic coordinates of the sample plots were also obtained. A series of canonical analyses was conducted to evaluate the relationships and to identify spatial structures in the species distributions left unexplained by the environmental variables. Four distinct distribution patterns were identified among the species; these were most strongly explained by land-use, the degree of canopy closure and topography. Significant spatial structures, independent of the measured environmental variables, were related to anthropogenic pressure and an edaphic gradient, and the habitat associations of the individual species were described. The results obtained from this case study suggest that land-use dynamics may play a predominant role in structuring inhabited landscapes, and that diversity in distribution patterns and habitat associations will require a combination of spatially explicit management strategies to ensure the local resource base.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'In a number of places, sacred forest sites play an important role in conservation and local livelihoods.

Numerous areas within this landscape are considered by the indigenous Tibetans of the region, who interact with these sites in ways potentially beneficial to conservation. Our previous remote sensing study indicated that sacred sites are found in habitats with greater species richness, diversity, and endemism than randomly selected non-sacred sites. This study examines the role of sanctity in biodiversity conservation within habitats in the Khawa Karpo region by pairing plots within the same habitats in sacred and non-sacred areas. Understory richness, diversity, cover, and number of useful species are measured; for trees, richness, diversity, cover, and density are measured. Results indicate that within habitats sanctity does not affect understory plant communities; however, within sacred areas trees are larger (p = 0.003) and forests have greater cover (p = 0.003) than non-sacred areas.

The impacts of deforestation in tropical biodiversity hotspots are of particular concern because these regions contain high concentrations of globally endemic species. However, the effects of large-scale deforestation on native biotas within the biodiversity hotspot of Himalaya remain poorly documented. Here we report on an alarming trend of deforestation in the Indian Himalaya and project the likely consequential extinctions of endemic taxa (species and subspecies) by 2100 across a broad range of taxonomic groups, including gymnosperms, angiosperms, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. With the current level of deforestation, by 2100 only about 10% of the land area of the Indian Himalaya will be covered by dense forest (>40% canopy scenario in which almost a quarter of the endemic species could be wiped out, including 366 endemic vascular plant taxa and 35 endemic vertebrate taxa. We also show that inaccurate reporting of forest cover data by governmental institutions can result in underestimations of the biological impacts of deforestation, as well as potential miscalculations in land-use decisions (e.g., the construction of hydroelectric dams). Large-scale conservation efforts, including forest protection and reforestation, are urgently needed to avoid the impending deforestation-driven biodiversity losses in the Himalaya.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Literature on spot-billed pelican has not been reviewed lately which could provide a critique of the emerging data.

This study investigated its impact on species richness and factors that contribute to its invasion success. Impact of Mikania on species richness was studied in areas invaded by Mikania and not yet invaded by Mikania by quadrat method. Growth experiments were carried out with Mikania rhizosphere soil and soil treated with Mikania leaf leachate. Chemical characteristics such as electrical conductivity, organic matter, extractable P, total organic N and water-soluble phenolics, and microbial respiration of soil invaded by Mikania and not yet invaded by Mikania were measured. We observed lower species richness in areas invaded by Mikania compared to areas not yet invaded by Mikania. Seedling growth was suppressed in Mikania rhizosphere soil or soil treated with higher levels of Mikania leaf leachate. Higher levels of organic matter, total organic N and water-soluble phenolics, and lower microbial activity were observed in Mikania rhizosphere soil. Soil treated with Mikania leaf leachate has higher amounts of water-soluble phenolics. Mikania invasion appears to reduce plant species richness in the Western Ghats, and discourage seedling growth of certain plant species. Factors that are likely to contribute to Mikania success are its ability to pre-empt light and alter soil chemistry and biochemistry in ways that benefit the species.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Rapid multiplication of endangered Vanda coerulea Griff ex.

This is especially true in the case of sub-adult animals leading to escalating conflicts and deaths in the surrounding human-dominated landscapes. Unless adequately protected against various human activities, such corridors and surrounding forests will soon disappear, trapping the animals within protected areas with resultant local extinctions. In this paper we ascertain tiger presence, occupancy and numbers in one such partially protected area, the Sathyamangalam forest, located close to better known tiger reserves in India, through non-invasive faecal DNA analysis. Here we highlight the potential of Sathyamangalam as a tiger habitat. Tiger positive faecal samples were considered as evidence to establish occupancy in two different parts of Sathyamangalam, reserve forest and wildlife sanctuary. We collected 103 faecal samples out of which 69 were tiger positive. Species occupancy (psi), was 0.672 with a detection probability of 0.2 in the wildlife sanctuary area; while psi was 0.72 with detection probability of 0.212 in the reserve forest. Further, number of males and females, as determined in our study, was close to the ideal sex ratio in a healthy forest with good prey abundance. This study also highlights the presence of more females in the reserve forest than the wildlife sanctuary possibly indicating lesser disturbance and more prey availability. We recommend that the reserve forest to the north of Sathyamangalam wildlife sanctuary be declared as a tiger reserve. The wildlife sanctuary could serve as a buffer zone between this reserve and Sathyamangalam town which lies to the south of the forest. Proper protection of Sathyamangalam will go a long way in saving the entire landscape and tigers of the Western Ghats of India.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'We surveyed the distribution and status of the long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis umbrosa) in the Nicobar Islands of India.

It not only assists in chalking out suitable soil and water conservation measures to arrest erosion and conserve water but also helps in devising best management practices to enhance biomass production in watersheds. Keeping this in view, the present study has been undertaken by involving geospatial-statistical techniques to determine the critical and priority areas for soil and water conservation in Suketi watershed of the lower Himachal Himalayan region. A novel weighted sum analysis technique was used for ranking each of hydrological unit by obtaining the weightages from various morphometric parameters. This technique offers dynamic, effective and sustainable approach over traditional prioritization methods in which significance of each parameter were considered equally. Considering this approach, sub-watersheds were delineated into low, medium and high priority zones. The results illustrate that about 52 % of sub-watersheds of Suketi watershed are in moderate to high erosion and runoff susceptible zones. Therefore, these potential areas can be considered for preferential soil and water conservation planning. The results obtained from the study will be useful for various stakeholders such as agriculturists, water resource managers, conservation measures planners and decision policy makers for better management practices and decision making.

We studied the effect of forest fragment size on group encounters in lion-tailed macaques in the Western Ghats of southern India. The encounter rate decreased as the fragment size increased. Group density and home range overlap correlated positively with the encounter rate. The aggressive encounters were more in the relatively medium-sized fragment where the observed frequency of between-group encounters was higher than the expected frequency than in the small fragment and the large forest complex.

The underlying philosophy is that even major natural disruptions to climate cause ecohydrological shifts in the response of landscapes and such changes may be indicated from recent hydrology research evaluating man-made impacts. The paper assesses the existing conclusions from hydrological work undertaken in both the closed forests of the humid tropics and the open forests of the tropical semi-arid regions based mostly from experimentation in headwater catchments. Such studies are concerned with the hydrological responses to the impacts of forest conversion on the change in total water yield and, in turn, the processes connected with dry weather flow (delayed flow) and storm runoff (quickflow).

Analyses of local deforestation examine the significance of numerous explanatory variables for the extraction of forest products. This study distinguishes among the explanatory variables as household-specific and site-specific, and argues for in-depth analysis of household-specific variables. It examines the role of household size, income, and education on firewood extraction and beedi-making in the Western Ghats of India, a hotspot of biodiversity.

Two novel features of the study include analysis of wood and non-wood extraction through a single dataset and determination of model by the data. The results show high dependency of households on forest-based livelihoods, situations when the probability of livelihoods changes substantially, and non-parallel trends for household dependency.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the land potentiality in India for agroforestry based on FAO land suitability criteria utilizing various land, soil, climate, and topographic themes. This was achieved in GIS Domain by integrating various thematic layers scientifically. The analysis of land potentiality in India for agroforestry suitability reveals 32.8% as highly suitable (S1), 40.4% moderately suitable (S2), 11.7% marginally suitable (S3), and 9.1% not suitable (NS). About 52% of land of India is under the cropland category. In addition, it revealed that the 46% of these cropland areas fall into high agroforestry suitable category and provide huge opportunity for harnessing agroforestry practices. Furthermore, agroforestry suitability mapping in broad ecosystem and in different agroecological regions will assist various projects in India at the regional level. Such results will also boost the various objectives of the National Agroforestry Policy (2014, http://www.cafri.res.in/NAF_Policy.pdf) and policymakers of India where they need to extend it. The potential of geospatial technology can be exploited in the field of agroforestry for the benefit of rural poor people/farmers by ensuring food and ecological security, resilience in livelihoods, and can sustain extreme weather events such as droughts and climate change impact. Such type of research can be replicated in India at village level (local level) to state level (regional level) utilizing the significant themes which affect the agroforestry suitability.

The government has responded through restrictive measures to check this decline. Using tree biomass as proxy for degradation, we assessed the current state of biomass within dominant land use types and examined its implications for sustainability. The highest above-ground mean tree biomass density of 1158 was recorded for the reserved forest followed by 728, 13, 11, 8, 5 and 3 in the protected forest, fallow land, cultivated-unirrigated land, grassland, orchard land and cultivated-irrigated land respectively. Of the total accessible biomass, only 0.31% was extracted annually by the local people for fuel, fodder and other uses. Though, the current level of extraction may be sustainable in the short run, insufficient regeneration is observed for long term sustainability. Forest biomass production was simulated for the next 30 years with a logistic growth model and the relative significance of input variables in influencing system behaviour was analysed through sensitivity analysis.

For this, one hundred sampling points were selected using randomly stratified methodology, and considering all geomorphic surfaces including summit, shoulder, backslope, footslope and toeslope; and soil depth was actually measured. Eleven primary and secondary topographic attributes were derived from the digital elevation model (DEM) at the study area. The result of multiple linear regression indicated that slope, wetness index, catchment area and sediment transport index, which were included in the model, could explain about 76 % of total variability in soil depth at the selected site.

In this study, we have reported the results of inherent, as well as climate change driven vulnerability assessments for Indian forests. To assess inherent vulnerability of forests under current climate, we have used four indicators, namely biological richness, disturbance index, canopy cover, and slope. The assessment is presented as spatial profile of inherent vulnerability in low, medium, high and very high vulnerability classes. Fourty percent forest grid points in India show high or very high inherent vulnerability. Plantation forests show higher inherent vulnerability than natural forests. We assess the climate change driven vulnerability by combining the results of inherent vulnerability assessment with the climate change impact projections simulated by the Integrated Biosphere Simulator dynamic global vegetation model. While 46% forest grid points show high, very high, or extremely high vulnerability under future climate in the short term (2030s) under both representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5, such grid points are 49 and 54%, respectively, in the long term (2080s). Generally, forests in the higher rainfall zones show lower vulnerability as compared to drier forests under future climate. Minimizing anthropogenic disturbance and conserving biodiversity can potentially reduce forest vulnerability under climate change. For disturbed forests and plantations, adaptive management aimed at forest restoration is necessary to build long-term resilience.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Patterns of feeding ecology among the living macaques conform poorly with recognized phyletic distinctions within the genus because there is an important ecological division which cross-cuts phyletic groupings.

This region harbors variety of rare and endemic species of flora and fauna. It also has a strong bearing on regional climatic conditions. Extensive shifting cultivation, compounded by increasing population pressure and demands for agriculture land are the prime drivers in addition to other proximate drivers of deforestation. It is therefore of prime concern to analyse forest cover changes in the region, assess rate of change and extent and to identify the areas, which show repetitive changes. We analyzed forest cover maps from six temporal datasets based on satellite data interpretation, converted to geospatial database since 1972 till 1999. The states of Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura show highest changes in forest cover. Arunachal Pradesh shows least dynamic areas and maintains a good forest cover owing to its topographical inaccessibility in some areas.

Four different scenarios are tested in simulation: (1) homogeneous plate with fixed plate boundary (2) homogeneous plate with boundary forces (3) heterogeneous plate with fixed boundary (4) heterogeneous plate with boundary forces. The estimated orientation and magnitude of SHmax with a heterogeneous plate with boundary forces in the Himalayan region and an eastern plate boundary comprising the Indo-Burmese arc and Andaman subduction zone are consistent with measured maximum horizontal stress.

The spatial distribution of herbaceous biomass and species composition was measured across three scales in a semi-arid savanna in central Kenya, and patterns were related to environmental variables at different scales. Herbaceous biomass declined across a rainfall gradient and from upper to lower topographic positions, but variation within a site (across m) was similar in magnitude to among-site variation associated with rainfall and topography. Geostatistical analyses showed that patchiness at scales of m explained 20% of total variation in herbaceous biomass. This pattern arose from the presence of both diameter patches containing high herbaceous biomass (> 170 g and diameter patches characterized by nearly bare soil surfaces (< 40 g Patch structure was contingent on topography, with larger bare patches at ridgeline and upper hillslope positions. Grass species distributions showed the greatest degree of patch structure and species turnover across distances of m. Additional community variation was associated with topography, with minimal variation in species composition across the rainfall gradient. Pattern diversity significantly exceeded levels reported for four other grassland ecosystems, suggesting fundamental differences in local processes generating spatial pattern. It is hypothesized that heterogeneously distributed grazing pressure, interacting with the distribution of shrub canopies, is an important factor generating such high levels of small-scale patch structure in this savanna.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'A survey was conducted in 17 selectedthaluks (revenue sub-divisions) of Kerala state to elucidate the floristic structure, composition and the extent of similarities and diversities in the composition of homegardens of Kerala, with particular reference to small (below 0.4 ha), medium (0.5 to 2 ha) and large (>2.0 ha) holding size categories.

In this study, the dynamical characteristics of systematic errors of the NCUM model at horizontal resolution during the Indian summer monsoon (July and August 2017) are examined. It is found that the model has problem in maintaining the monsoon circulation and it weakens the monsoon by weakening the divergent winds over the Indian region. The model has a large spin up in global mean precipitation and evaporation from day-1 to day-3. In addition to the spin up problem, the model loses mass as the forecast length increases from day-1 to day-10. However, the pressure over India increases in forecasts from day-3 up to day-10. An anticyclonic circulation error over north Arabian Sea and adjoining region reduces moisture transport from the sea to the Indian land areas. The model has systematic tendency to forecast less rain as the forecast length increases. Differences between the ERA-Interim and the NCUM analysis in circulation and moisture parameters indicate uncertainties in the initial conditions and imbalance in moisture and divergence. Relationship between circulation errors and rainfall errors over a river basin (Mahanadi basin in Odisha) was studied. There is no linear relation between divergent or rotational components of wind errors and rainfall errors in forecasts over this basin.

We provide a country-wide assessment of Indian river ecosystems in order to identify and prioritize areas for protection and restoration of freshwater fish fauna. Using various biodiversity and anthropogenic attributes, coupled with tools of ecological modeling, we delineated areas for fish fauna conservation and restoration in the 20 major river basins of India. To do this, we used prioritization analyses and reserve selection algorithms to derive conservation value index (CVI) and vulnerability index (VI) of the river basins. CVI was estimated using endemicity, rarity, conservation value, and taxonomic singularity, while VI was estimated using a disturbance index derived from percent geographic area of the basin under human settlements, human population density, predominant land use, and total number of exotic fish species in each basin. The two indices, CVI and VI, were converted into geo-referenced maps, and each map was super-imposed onto species richness and forest cover maps, respectively. After superimposition, areas with high CVI and low VI shade intensities were delineated for conservation, while areas with high CVI and high VI shade intensities were demarcated for restoration. In view of the importance of freshwater fish for human livelihoods and consumption, and ecosystems of rivers, we call for urgent attention to the conservation of their fish fauna along with restoration of their degraded habitats.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'There are many vanishing cultures that possess a wealth of knowledge on the medicinal utility of plants.

In this article, we review 82 studies from India, covering 47 species from four taxonomic classes. We examine and discuss the trends in the selection of study species, habitats and objectives of radio-telemetry studies and the functional success of radio collars and tags. A strong bias for study species and study region is observed and researchers generally tend not to look beyond the traditional research questions. Habitats that are difficult to access, such as the Trans-Himalayas, the Himalayas and north-eastern India, are overlooked. Most of the studies aimed to infer primary information only, such as home range, migration and movement patterns and habitat preference (53.7%, 47.6% and 28.1% studies, respectively). We expect these trends to change with time as the development of technology allows researchers to explore further. We investigated the tracking histories of 483 animals and the records of 496 radio collars or tags, but detailed information could be acquired for only 330 collars or tags. Of the collars, 49% malfunctioned before the end of their anticipated life due to a variety of reasons, early battery drainage being the prevalent cause.

Issues with permissions and capturing animals for tagging, particular to India, are also discussed. A uniform and centralized system for granting permissions and guidelines for capturing and handling animals would be beneficial to future telemetry studies.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Arunachal Pradesh, the easternmost part of India, is endowed with diverse natural resources and inhabited by a variety of ethnic groups that have developed skills to exploit the biotic resources of the region for food and medicines. Information on animals and animal parts as components of folk remedies used by local healers and village headmen of the Nyishi and Galo tribes in their respective West Siang and Subansiri districts were obtained through interviews and structured questionnaires. Of a total of 36 vertebrate species used in treatments of ailments and diseases, mammals comprised 50%; they were followed by birds (22%), fishes (17%), reptiles (8%) and amphibians (3%). Approximately 20 common complaints of humans as well as foot and mouth disease of cattle were targets of zootherapies. Most commonly treated were fevers, body aches and pains, tuberculosis, malaria, wounds and burns, typhoid, smallpox, dysentery and diarrhoea, jaundice, and early pregnancy pains. Very few domestic animal species (e.g., goat and cattle) were used zootherapeutically. More frequently it was wild animals, including endangered or protective species like hornbill, pangolin, clouded leopard, tiger, bear, and wolf, whose various parts were either used in folk remedies or as food. Some of the animal-based traditional medicines or animal parts were sold at local markets, where they had to compete with modern, western pharmaceuticals. To record, document, analyze and test the animal-derived local medicines before they become replaced by western products is one challenge; to protect the already dwindling populations of certain wild animal species used as a resource for the traditional animal-derived remedies, is another.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The rain shadow regions requisite a comprehensive watershed development and management plan for sustainable water resources management. The Pambar River Basin (PRB) lies on the rain shadow region of the southern Western Ghats, India, where climate showed marked intra-basin variation. A morphometric analysis was done to evaluate the drainage characteristics of PRB using topographical maps and digital elevation data. PRB was divided into eighteen 4th order basins (SB1-SB18), distributed along various climatic gradients. Lower order streams mostly dominate PRB and drainage pattern is a function of relief and structure. The terrain is highly dissected and prone to soil erosion during heavy storms and the elongated shape of PRB enables easier flood management. The influence of climate on drainage characteristics was evidently emphasized in basin morphometry. Four distinctively different classes were identified based on the morphometric similarities. The significance of morphometric analysis on the hydrological characterization is discussed and the relevance of the present study in water harvesting has been explicated.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Water demand in India is growing due to its increasing population, economic growth and urbanization. Consequently, knowledge of interdependencies of large-scale hydrometeorological processes is crucial for efficient water resources management. Estimates of Groundwater (GW) derived from Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) data provided by Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission along with various other satellite observations and model estimates now facilitates such investigations. In an attempt which is first of its kind in India, this study proposes Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based spatiotemporal analysis of Precipitation (P), Evapotranspiration (ET), Surface Soil Moisture (SSM), Root Zone Soil Moisture (RZSM), TWS and GW to understand such interdependencies at intra- and interannual time scales. Results indicate that of the total variability is explained by the first 6 ICs of all the variables, analyzed for a period The Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) is the causative-factor of the first component describing of the total variability. The phase difference between all seasonal components of P and that of RZSM and ET is a month whereas it is between the seasonal components of P and that of SSM, TWS and GW. ET is observed to be largely dependent on RZSM while GW appears as the major component of TWS. GW and TWS trends of opposite nature were observed in northern and southern part of India caused by inter-annual rainfall variability. These findings when incorporated in modelling frameworks would improve forecasts resulting in better water management.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) is considered to be an extraordinarily durable building timber with a worldwide reputation. Its widespread use has entailed the over-exploitation of natural forests and a large reduction in natural diversity. Fifteen microsatellite markers were used to study the genetic variability and structure of 166 teak trees distributed over the whole natural area of teak. Analysis showed that in the teak natural area there were four main centers of genetic variability. Two clusters were in India and could be considered as main centers of genetic diversity in teak. The third cluster mainly consisting of populations in Thailand and Laos was genetically very distinct from the Indian populations but presented only half as much allelic variability. A fourth cluster from Central Laos showed even less genetic variability. The use of SSR markers for conservation of teak forest diversity is discussed.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'We studied the ranging pattern of the wild black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) at Xiaochangdu, Tibet from June 2003 to March 2005. Using the map grid cell method, the group home range were 16.75 km2 in summer, 10.50 km2 in winter, and 21.25 km2 total over two years. The daily travel length (DTL) averaged 765 m with a range of m. The results showed that DTL in winter was significantly shorter than those of in summer and spring. Temperature, rainfall, food availability, and human disturbance correlated positively with DTL. According to the maximum observed group size and estimated total home range, population density and biomass of R. bieti were 9.1 individuals/km2 and 88.6 kg/km2, respectively. The temporal and spatial variations of food resources and patterns of human disturbance largely determine the ranging behavior of R. bieti at Xiaochangdu.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'An efficient protocol was developed for short-term storage and conservation of a woody medicinal climber, Decalepis hamiltonii, using encapsulated nodal segments.

Species diversity and composition of homegardens are influenced by a number of environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural factors. The present study examines the tree species diversity in the homegardens of different cultural groups of Barak Valley, Assam, Northeast India. Complete enumeration was done for diversity analysis in 181 homegardens from 38 villages in the three districts of the Valley. Factors affecting plant diversity were analyzed, and the floristic composition of the homegardens was found to vary with garden size, ethnicity of the homegarden owners, and geographical parameters such as location and altitude. Results indicate high plant diversity, with a total of 161 tree species identified from 47 families. Tea garden labor communities were comparatively found to hold more diversity in their homegardens. Similarity and cluster analysis revealed the distinctness of the majority of the homegardens, and seven groups of homegardens with very low distance were revealed. Homegardens were also found to maintain considerable conservation value as repositories of many underutilized, wild, and rare plant species. Biodiversity conservation in the homegardens was found to be linked to the multiple values of the different plant species to the homegardeners and further highlight the concept of the through approach. For the preservation of such traditional agroforestry systems, which also have the potential to provide options for adaptation to climate change, proper documentation of traditional knowledge concerning the different plant species and the human-nature interaction in the homegardens is necessary before such systems are completely lost.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Spiders are omnipresent, occurring in almost all terrestrial habitats. They are generalist predators and important for conservation biocontrol in agricultural fields, helping to reduce pesticide applications. In this study, we examined how spider families and spider web types in rice fields are related to local and landscape management. Samples were taken in differently managed rice fields adjoining either homegarden polycultures or banana monocultures. Furthermore, landscape structure, prey abundance, herb richness and cover were taken into account. The results showed that prey availability explained most of the variation in spiders and their abundance, indicating that spiders in the rice fields can potentially contribute to pest control. Adjacent habitat had no effect on the spider populations, but maintaining fallow fields in the surrounding landscape seems to be a useful measure to promote Erigoninae in rice fields. There was no evidence that local management practices such as fertiliser and pesticide use had an impact on spider families, which appeared to be due to the low level of these inputs. Spider web sampling can complement spider sampling as it detects spiders hidden at the base of the rice tillers, which are likely to be missed by sweep netting. Additionally, tetragnathid webs are easy to observe and thus can be used as an indication for farmers not to spray pesticides as spiders are potentially controlling the pest species. Interviews with farmers made clear that many farmers in the study area showed their interest in management methods that promote biological pest control.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The conservation of Himalayan forests is big concern in view of global agenda. Many studies in this endeavor reported that the rate of forests degradation is posing a severe threat to the landscape and existing biodiversity in the Himalayas. Currently there many conservation approaches exists and of them four are widely recognized (1) Conservation through traditional religious beliefs conserved (TCF); (2) Conservation through governmental planning and schemes conserved (GCF); (3) Conservation through creation of protected areas (PAF); and (4) Conservation through community efforts conserved (CCF). Our hypothesis in this direction says that all the conservation approaches lead to same results concerning to forest conservation. To testify our hypothesis we have studied the forests of each conservation regimes and evaluated them based on the identified indicators. We have done empirical studies and following the cloud-free satellite data were used for last three decades (such as Multi-Spectral Scanner, Linear Imaging and Self Scanning, and Enhanced Thematic Mapper ) to study a change in vegetation dynamics of the mountain forests in multi-temporal dimension. Our research concluded that community conservation approach have greater significance for biodiversity conservation and management in the Himalayan region. Here we support the model of CCF for forest ecosystem conservation, alongside the sustainable livelihood of the mountain societies. But every conservation regimes has its own importance in viewpoint of the particular objectives. Therefore, we suggests advancement and revision of PAF and GCF however, some elements of CCF can be introduced in TCF for making up it more sound in view of rapid socio-economic and cultural changes taking place in the communities.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The people of Manipur, a state in northeast India, follow ancestral worship and animism in the form of deity worship, with the central focus on worship in forest patches. The beliefs and taboos associated with the Sylvan deities (Umanglais) in the forest patches are restricted to any sort of disturbance of flora and fauna. These social boundaries help to conserve the entire organism as a whole, which stand the concept of sacred groves. The pleasing of deities is performed every year by the Meiteis, a dominant community of Manipur, in honour of the deities and to gain their favour. Indigenous cultural and rituals practices of the local people in sacred groves serve as a tool for conserving biodiversity. Sacred groves are distributed over a wide ecosystem and help in conservation of rare and endemic species. Well-preserved sacred groves are store houses of valuable medicinal and other plants having high economic value, and serve as a refuge to threatened species. One hundred and sixty-six sacred groves were inventoried in Manipur valley that comprises Imphal east, Imphal west, Thoubal and Bishnupur districts of the state. Detailed studies were carried out in four selected sacred groves, to know the importance of biodiversity status and vegetation characteristics. A total of 173 plant species representing 145 genera under 70 families were recorded through baseline floristic survey. The species diversity indices were compared among the four studied groves. The vegetation composition and community characteristics were recorded. Ethnobotanical uses of species were examined, which reveal that 96% of the species were used as medicine for the treatment of various ailments. Utilization of herbal medicine by the Meiteis is closely related to the cultural and ritual practices. A few of the medicinal plants which have disappeared from the locality are now confined only to the groves. Socio-cultural aspects were investigated taking into account the attitudes of local people, which indicate social beliefs and taboo are eroding, simultaneously degrading the degree of protection of sacred groves. Therefore, conservation measures of sacred groves need to be formulated considering the factor of degradation and the basic necessities of the local people. Until and unless a viable option is provided to the local people (especially those who habitat nearby the adjoining areas) for sustaining their economic condition, no step for conservation of biodiversity will be successful.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The taxonomy of the Hanuman langur (Semnopithecus spp.), a widely distributed Asian colobine monkey, has been in a flux for a long time due to much disagreement between various classification schemes. However, results from a recent field-based morphological study were consistent with (Ceylon J Sci 1939) species level classification scheme. Here we tested the validity of S. hypoleucos and S. priam, the two South Indian species recognized by Hill. To this end, one mitochondrial and four nuclear markers were sequenced from over 72 non-invasive samples of Hanuman langurs and S. johnii collected from across India. The molecular data were subjected to various tree building methods. The nuclear data was also used in a Bayesian structure analysis and to determine the genealogical sorting index of each hypothesized species. Results from nuclear data suggest that the South Indian population of Hanuman langur consists of two units that correspond to the species recognized by Hill. However in the mitochondrial tree S. johnii and S. priam were polyphyletic probably due to retention of ancestral polymorphism and/or low levels of hybridization. Implications of these results on conservation of Hanuman langurs are also discussed.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'In the present communication habitat ecology, species diversity; distribution and different indices of fish biodiversity management were studied in a Central India river (River Betwa, a tributary of River Ganga basin approved under first river linking plan). Correlation between fish species richness with the hydrological attributes showed good relationship and water depth, dissolved oxygen and pH were found the most important variables in shaping fish assemblage. Altogether, sixty-three fish species belonging to 20 families and 45 genera were collected from five sampling stations spread along the upstream, mid stream and lower streams. Cyprinids were the most dominated group represented by 26 species belonging to 15 genera, followed by Bagridae (6 species from 3 genera), and Schilbeidae (4 species from 4 genera). The distribution of fish showed interesting pattern and about 10% species were common to all the sites showing long migration range. Shannon-Weiner diversity index showed considerable variation and ranged from 1.89 to 3.51. Out of 63 species status of 10 species were not known due to data deficit, 29 categorized as lower risk, 14 as vulnerable, 8 as endangered, while the remaining two species were introduced. Our study shows that the River supports considerable diversity of the fishes and is important for conservation and about 34% fish fauna is threatened being either vulnerable or endangered. We assessed that the river supports considerable percentage of food fish (89.47), ornamental fish (49.12%) and sport fish (5.26%). Among the eight major types of fish habitats identified along the entire stretch of river, open river, shallow water and deep pools were habitats contributing maximum diversity. Fish species richness (FSR) were significantly different in all the habitats except channel confluence and scour pool. Trophic niche model may be useful for assessing altered as well as less altered fish habitat of the tropical rivers. Since this river will be interlinked in near future, this study would be useful for conservation planning and management and also for future assessment after interlinking.

Multiple shoots were induced on semi-solid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 6-benzyladenine (BA). Addition of ascorbic acid considerably reduced browning of tissue and medium. Best shoot regeneration was observed from petiolar explants and was, therefore, used for all further studies. An indexing method was introduced for checking bacterial contamination in well established shoot multiplication cultures. It was found that bacterial infection was quite high in shoots derived from nodal and internodal explants while it was least in those obtained from petiolar segments. Only shoots that indexed negative for endogenous bacteria were used for proliferation and in vitro conservation studies. At the end of in proliferation medium which consisted of MS supplemented with BA and ascorbic acid as many as 22 shoot buds of length could be obtained. Shoot buds developed into clusters for ease of further proliferation. A step of shoot elongation for in liquid MS basal medium was found to be beneficial for getting long and healthy shoots for rooting. Single shoots were rooted in indole butyric acid that could be successfully acclimatized under nethouse conditions. A conservation strategy was also developed. The shoot cultures could be maintained without subculturing for as long as in MS medium supplemented with paclobutrazol (PBZ) and ascorbic acid.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum Maton) has great commercial value as a spice crop in India.

Various innovations are being provided that aim at promoting both improved livelihood for the people and the conservation and management of natural resources in the Central Himalaya of India. Many studies point out the factors responsible for the tremendous decline of natural resources and also how they have affected the local livelihood options. In this context, the current study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of various solutions/innovations that are being implemented in the Himalayas of India. Unfortunately, only a few are found to be successful in both conservation and sustainable livelihood development. This study reveals that people are still looking for more viable solutions that could help them improve their lifestyle, as well as facilitating ecosystem conservation and supporting existing biodiversity.

Sixty-three critically endangered and endangered bird species are reportedly threatened by tourism. Among those 63 species, marine, coastal and aquatic birds are threatened more by tourism than was expected. Hotspots with the most species threatened by tourism are and the Mediterranean Basin. This study uses individual threatening processes in a new way to characterise hotspots for conservation action, advancing previous identification criteria.

Identifying priority areas for conservation within these forests is essential to their effective management. However, this requires current, accurate environmental information that is often lacking in developing countries. The Cockpit Country, Jamaica, contains forests of international importance in terms of levels of endemism and overall diversity. information, we used satellite remote sensing data and fragmentation analysis to identify interior forested areas that have experienced little or no change as priority conservation sites. We classified Landsat images from 1985, 1989, 1995, 2002, and 2008, using an object-oriented method, which allowed for the inclusion of roads. We conducted our fragmentation analysis using metrics to quantify changes in forest patch number, area, shape, and aggregation. Deforestation and fragmentation fluctuated within the 23-year period but were mostly confined to the periphery of the forest, close to roads and access trails. An area of core forest that remained intact over the period of study was identified within the largest forest patch, most of which was located within the boundaries of a forest reserve and included the last remaining patches of closed-broadleaf forest. These areas should be given highest priority for conservation, as they constitute important refuges for endemic or threatened biodiversity. Minimizing and controlling access will be important in maintaining this core.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Plant invasion is highly responsive to rising temperature, altered precipitation and various anthropogenic disturbances.

Overall, 20,501 records with a total of 9112 unique plots and 161 unique invasive species were recorded in the database that shows a maximum of 15 invasive species in a nested quadrat. Cumulative analysis showed a maximum of 53 invasive species at grid. Individually, GWR could reveal a significant correlation with invasive species distribution for temperature anomaly and precipitation anomaly while OLS model did not offer a good correlation compared to GWR. Combination of temperature and precipitation anomaly (shared model) showed an improved spatial correlation using GWR. Variation partitioning revealed the dominant influence of variation) of temperature anomaly over Deccan Peninsula, Himalaya and North East zone. Influence of precipitation anomaly was more prominent over arid and semi-arid zone explaining of variation. Results revealed the strength of GWR to see the interaction of invasive plant species w.r.t. climate anomalies that explain the influence of spatial variation due to heterogeneity at varying neighbour distances. The significant correlation of invasive species with both the anomalies revealed the affinity of invasive species towards warmer, drier and wet places. This gives an indication that the distribution of invasive species could be triggered by climate anomaly. The use of other predictor variables (i.e. edaphic and anthropogenic) could be an inclusive input in a future perspective.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Landscapes consist of heterogeneous interacting dynamic elements with complex ecological, economic and cultural attributes.

Hydrobiological studies which were well developed in the beginning of this century, gained momentum soon after independence as all kinds of aquatic habitats were investigated for the assessment, conservation and optimum utilization of inland fishery resources of the country. However, the environmental issues which dominated since the 1972 Stockholm Conference, and growing realization of the problem of water pollution, resulted in a rapid proliferation of hydrobiological studies which tend to focus on correlation between the distribution of various organisms and degree of water pollution or the effects of various organic and inorganic pollutants.

The space-time variations of rainfall are considered with the help of climatic pentad rainfall charts and diagrams. The rainfall of several north and central Indian stations shows a minimum around mid-August and a maximum around mid-February which seem to be connected with the extreme summer and winter positions of the ITCZ and the associated north-south shifts in the seasonal circulation patterns.

In this paper, we investigate the bounds on terrestrial carbon uptake over India that arises solely due to CO  2  -fertilization. For this purpose, we use a terrestrial carbon cycle model and consider two extreme scenarios: unlimited CO2-fertilization is allowed for the terrestrial vegetation with CO2 concentration level at in one case, and CO2-fertilization is capped at year 1975 levels for another simulation. Our simulations show that, under equilibrium conditions, modeled carbon stocks in natural potential vegetation increase by 17 Gt-C with unlimited fertilization for CO2 levels and climate change corresponding to the end of 21st century but they decline by 5.5 Gt-C if fertilization is limited at 1975 levels of CO2 concentration. The carbon stock changes are dominated by forests. The area covered by natural potential forests increases by about 36% in the unlimited fertilization case but decreases by 15% in the fertilization-capped case. Thus, the assumption regarding CO2-fertilization has the potential to alter the sign of terrestrial carbon uptake over India. Our model simulations also imply that the maximum potential terrestrial sequestration over India, under equilibrium conditions and best case scenario of unlimited CO2-fertilization, is only 18% of the 21st century SRES A2 scenarios emissions from India. The limited uptake potential of the natural potential vegetation suggests that reduction of CO2 emissions and afforestation programs should be top priorities.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Biodiversity loss is a problem of global concern affecting ecosystem functioning and services provided to humans. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is built on a conceptual framework that links biodiversity with the services ecosystems provide to society and human welfare.

Based on this, we first compile market and non-market forest valuation studies and, secondly, explore the potential of an econometric modelling exercise by conducting a worldwide meta-analysis. This exercise aims to highlight the role of biodiversity indicators on valuation. In this way, we can study the underlying transmission mechanisms that explain to what extent biodiversity is related to human welfare. Furthermore, we also propose to evaluate the magnitudes of the respective distributional impacts, including the different ecosystem goods and services under consideration.

Across their range, tiger (Panthera tigris) populations occur in small fragmented patches of habitat, often isolated by large distances in human-dominated landscapes. We assessed connectivity between 16 protected areas (PAs) in central India, a global priority landscape for tiger conservation, using data on land use and land cover, human population density, and transportation infrastructure. We identified and prioritized movement routes using a combination of least-cost corridor modeling and circuit theory. Our analyses suggest that there are several opportunities to maintain connectivity in this landscape. We mapped a total of thirty-five linkages in the region and calculated metrics to estimate their quality and importance. The highest quality linkages as measured by the ratio of cost-weighted distance to Euclidean distance are and cost-weighted distance to least-cost path length are We used current flow centrality to evaluate the contribution of each PA and linkage toward facilitating animal movement. Values are highest for Kanha and Pench tiger reserves, and the linkages between and suggesting that these PAs and linkages play a critical role in maintaining connectivity in central India. In addition, smaller areas such as Bor, Nawegaon, and Phen have high centrality scores relative to their areas and thus may act as important stepping stones. We mapped pinch points, which are sections of the linkages where tiger movement is restricted due to unfavorable habitat, transportation networks, human habitation, or a combination of factors. Currently, very limited data exist on tiger movement outside of PAs to validate model results. Regional-scale connectivity mapping efforts can assist managers and policy makers to develop strategic plans for balancing wildlife conservation and other land uses in the landscape.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The goal of biodiversity hotspots is to identify regions around the world where conservation priorities should be focused. We undertake a geographic information system and remote sensing analysis to identify the rarest and least protected forests in biodiversity hotspots. World Wildlife Fund ecoregions with terrestrial forest were subset from 34 biodiversity hotspots and forest cover calculated from GlobCover data at a pixel resolution. There were 276 ecoregions in 32 biodiversity hotspots classified as containing terrestrial forests. When the first quartile of forest ecoregions was subset based on smallest extent of forest cover in protected areas, there were 69 rare forests identified within 20 biodiversity hotspots. Most rare forest ecoregions (45) occurred on islands or island archipelagos and 47 rare forest ecoregions contained less than forest cover in protected areas. San Ambrosio Islands Temperate Forests, Tubuai Tropical Moist Forests, Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago Tropical Moist Forests, and Yap Tropical Dry Forests were identified as the least protected and possibly most vulnerable forests within biodiversity hotspots. These ecoregions cover less than forest cover is less than and there are no protected areas. There is a need to update classifications and boundaries of protected areas, insure that islands are included in global land cover datasets, and identify levels of endemism and endangerment within forest ecoregions.

Because of this property, several derivatives of CPT are widely used as chemotherapeutic agents. The compound is produced by several plant species, including Nothapodytes nimmoniana (Family: Icacinaceae) presumably as a deterrent to insect pests. Here, we report, a lepidopteran larva, Lymantria sp. of Lymantriidae family which feeds voraciously on the leaves of N. nimmoniana, without any adverse consequences. Larval body weight and molting period were unaffected despite captive feeding of the larva with CPT enriched leaves. Mass spectrometric analysis indicated that nearly 46% of the ingested CPT was excreted while the rest was sequestered predominantly in the exuviae and setae (~35%). Although most of the CPT was in the parental form as found in the plant, traces of inactive, sulfated forms of CPT were recovered from the larva. Compared to that in plant, there were no critical mutations at the CPT binding domain of the Top 1. The gut pH of the larva was alkaline The alkaline gut environment converts CPT from its active, lactone form to inactive, carboxylate form. It is likely that such conversion might help the larva to reduce the overall burden of CPT in its gut.

In this study, we characterized the spatial patterns in phenological variations in eight contrasting forest types in an Indian region using coarse resolution NOAA AVHRR satellite data. The onset, offset and growing season length for different forest types has been estimated using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Further, the relationship between NDVI and climatic parameters has been assessed to determine which climatic variable (temperature or precipitation) best explain variation in NDVI. In addition, we also assessed how quickly and over what time periods does NDVI respond to different precipitation events. Our results suggested strong spatial variability in NDVI metrics for different forest types. Among the eight forest types, tropical dry deciduous forests showed lowest values for summed NDVI (SNDVI), averaged NDVI (ANDVI) and integrated NDVI (I-NDVI), while the tropical wet evergreen forests of Arunachal Pradesh had highest values. Within the different evergreen forest types, SNDVI, ANDVI and INDVI were highest for tropical wet evergreen forests, followed by tropical evergreen forests, tropical semi-evergreen forests and were least for tropical dry evergreen forests. Differences in the amplitude of NDVI were quite distinct for evergreen forests compared to deciduous ones and mixed deciduous forests. Although, all the evergreen forests studied had a similar growing season length of 270 days, the onset and offset dates were quite different. Response of vegetative greenness to climatic variability appeared to vary with vegetation characteristics and forest types. Linear correlations between mean monthly NDVI and temperature were found to yield negative relationships in contrast to precipitation, which showed a significant positive response to vegetation greenness. The correlations improved much for different forest types when the log of cumulative rainfall was correlated against mean monthly NDVI. Of the eight forest types, the NDVI for six forest types was positively correlated with the logarithm of cumulative rainfall that was summed for months. Overall, this study identifies precipitation as a major control for vegetation greenness in tropical forests, more so than temperature.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Demand for new environmental services from forests requires improved monitoring of these services at three scales: project-, regional-, and national-level.

The rubber tree is an economically important plantation species, and therefore factors other than climate may play a significant role in determining its occurrence. To assist in future planning, we used the maximum entropy model to predict plausible areas for the expansion of rubber tree plantations under a changing climate scenario. Inclusion of elevation, soil and socioeconomic factors into the model did not result in a significant increase in the model accuracy estimates over the bioclimatic model but their effect was pronounced in the predicted probability scoring of species occurrence. Among various factors, elevation, rooting condition, village population and agricultural labour availability contributed substantially to the model in the NE region, whereas for the WG region, climate was the most important contributing factor for rubber tree distribution.

This study reports on interviews conducted with farmers and other stakeholders to document the production practices and the potential environmental and economic benefits associated with maavee rice paddies. The maavee production system has prevailed for at least several decades. Farmers apply no chemicals to their paddies, relying instead on alluvial deposits as a source of nutrients, and on the natural pest and disease resistance of their traditional varieties. The maavee rice product can attain three times the selling price of rice from conventional farms making it more economically viable than conventional rice production. However, much of maavee production is for home consumption and the system is threatened by increasing labour costs, an ageing farming population and pressures to increase rice yields.

The primary objective of this study is to ascertain the number of morphologically recognizable units (morphotypes) of Hanuman langur in peninsular India and to compare our field observations with published classification schemes. We typed five color-independent characters for multiple adults from various populations in South India.

The wild species examined consisted of 18 accessions (16 exotic and 2 indigenous) of A. caillei, 29 accessions of A. manihot, 16 accessions of A. moschatus and 5 accessions of A. tuberculatus. All the wild Abelmoschus species exhibited high diversity (as measured by Shannon Diversity Index) for 3 qualitative characters viz. intensity of stem colour, leaf shape, epicalyx shape, 13 quantitative characters and 3 biotic stress parameters. Among the wild species, A. caillei and A. tuberculatus showed maximum and minimum diversity for qualitative characters, respectively. There was significant variation for 19 out of 24 quantitative characters studied. Inter-species diversity pattern as estimated through Minimum Variance Dendrogram and Principal Component Analysis revealed clear differentiation among the species with minimum overlapping indicating close association between geographical origins and clustering pattern. Intra-species diversity indicated role of specific adaptation in sub-clustering. Resistance to YVMD was found in accessions belonging to three wild species viz.

The semi-friable calli when cultured in the same medium augmented with 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and acetic acid (NAA) discrete globular embryoids in The isolated embryoids in hormone-free media yielded 65% plantlets. Furthermore, embryoids and axenic shoots exhibited maximum shoot induction in medium supplemented with Thidiazuron (TDZ). The shoot initials after subculture in media supplemented with BAP and TDZ produced shoot proliferation followed by elongation in basal medium. The elongated shoots produced roots in media supplemented with NAA. With this established rooted plantlets could be harvested after from a single embryoid.

The freshwater aquatic resources of the different river basins are unevenly distributed in space and time and the country is suffering from the increasing population and shortage of all kind of natural resources like water. To fulfill the water demand and mitigate flood and drought, Indian Government has been planning a huge scheme encompassing the Himalayas and most of India, by linking all major rivers through interlinking canals systems and building several dams. Though the concept of interlinking of rivers is novel and new in India, it had rather initiated long back in other countries of ancient civilization. This is considered as one of the options to remedy spatial mismatch in water availability and demand. To overcome those, National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has taken up massive project and nearly 30 links have been proposed to interlink the major rivers. The Government of India has approved the first river interlinking project on and a MOU has been signed among the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh and the Union Government. The feasibility report of most of the links have been completed and detailed project reports of River link is expected to be finalized soon. Our study indicated presence of rich fish diversity and threatened fishes in river Betwa and improved aquatic environment in river Ken which makes it a high priority area in view of proposed interlinking.

TDF covers approximately of India, whereas according to the MODIS fire burns per year. As studies on wildfire effects upon ESs and biodiversity in Indian TDFs are rare we partly transferred findings from other (dry) forest areas to the environmental situation in India. In India (intentionally lit) wildfires have a very important connection to local livelihoods and the availability of non-wood forest products. Very important adverse long-term effects are the deterioration of forest ecosystems and soil degradation. The potential for TDF to regulate hydrological cycles is expected to be greater in the absence of fire than with it. A general judgment on the effect of fire on biodiversity is difficult as it depends on the community and species involved but a loss of biodiversity under regular burnings is apparent. Consequently, forest managers need sound knowledge regarding the interplay of wildfires and ecosystem behavior in general and more specific knowledge regarding the effects on taxa being considered for conservation efforts.

Our study focuses on 32 landraces of small millets that are still used by indigenous farmers located in the rain fed areas of rural India and Nepal. Traditional knowledge of traits and utility was gathered using participatory methods and semi-structured interviews with key informants.

The habitat suitability map for leopard cats showed majority of the habitat as unsuitable and predicted only areas of lower temperate forests as moderate to highly suitable. As highly suitable habitats of the leopard cat are in close proximity to villages, conflict issues are a major threat and therefore need to be addressed in conservation program for this felid.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Twenty-four species of sedges (representing six genera) from different vegetation types in Western Ghats, South India, were examined for vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) associations. All the sedges had VAM fungal infections with hyphae and vesicles, but arbuscules were observed only in 42% of the total species. The VAM fungal colonization varied considerably between species, ranging from 9 to 62%. Root colonization was positively and negatively correlated with root diameter and root hair length, respectively. The number of VAM fungal spores in the rhizosphere varied from 5 to 86 g-1 soil. No significant relationship was found between spore numbers or root colonization and either soil pH or moisture. Four Glomus spp., one Acaulospora sp., one Sclerocystis spp., and one Gigaspora sp. were identified among the VAM fungal spores. The results reflect a high incidence of VAM in sedges occurring in Western Ghats and emphasize the need to assess the VAM status of plant species from different ecosystems to understand their mycorrhizal status.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'A combination of vertical electrical sounding (VES) and and stable isotope geochemistry is used in this study to trace out the extension of a dyke and for deciphering the subsurface piping phenomena in a landslide-affected hamlet, Pasukadavu, in the Western Ghats of Kerala, India.

This frog species is a major biotic component of the agroecosystems of the Western Ghats and where malathion (diethyl [(dimethoxy phosphino thioyl] butanediote), an organophosphate pesticide, is being used extensively. Although malathion is known to cause nonreversible acetylcholine inhibition and diminishes activity, growth and development in amphibian tadpoles, such data on Indian amphibian species are lacking. In the present study, increments in the following were used to assess such an impact: tadpole growth; increase in total length, body length, tail length, and body weight; and food consumption. The different concentrations of malathion employed were 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000 Malathion exposure produced significant effects on all measured parameters. Tadpole survival decreased from 20 to 6 tadpoles, with an increase in concentration followed by a decrease in growth. Food consumption of surviving tadpoles also decreased (0.067 to 0.0075 with increased malathion. Decreased food consumption, growth, and development of L. limnocharis tadpoles with an increase of malathion concentration (within field concentration range) over temporal scale reveal the possible threat to this species in the agroecosystems of the Western Ghats.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Present study deals with the vegetation type mapping, structure and composition analysis of the tropical forests, spread over 1,294 km2 area in South Andaman Islands.

The present investigation, therefore, has attempted to detect the trends in the monsoon rainfall, runoff, dam storage, post-monsoon groundwater (PMGW) levels, and agricultural data in the Karha Basin, located in the rain shadow zone of the Western Ghat. Additionally, trends in projected monsoon rainfall and average annual temperature were also analyzed. The study indicates no significant increase in monsoon rainfall over the basin during past and future The noteworthy decline in monsoon runoff has mainly resulted due to the effective implementation of surface water harvesting in the basin, which has a significant positive change in PMGW table in the basin. The study also provides evidence of the shift in agricultural pattern, where the rainfed crops are getting replaced by the high water-requiring/cash crops. It may increase the future agricultural water demand and pressurize the limited water resources in the basin. On the other hand, significant increase in near-term future (up to 2050) temperature can augment the water demand along with the adverse impacts on the agricultural productivity. The Karha Basin is already suffering from water deficiency.

The caenogastropod component dominates in terms of species richness and diversity of morphology, physiology, life and reproductive modes and has produced several highly speciose endemic radiations. Ancient oligotrophic lakes (e.g., Baikal, Ohrid, Tanganyika) are key hotspots of gastropod diversity; also noteworthy are a number of lower river basins (e.g., Congo, Mekong, Mobile Bay). But unlike many other invertebrates, small streams, springs and groundwater systems have produced the most speciose associations of freshwater gastropods. Despite their ecological importance in many aquatic ecosystems, understanding of even their systematics is discouragingly incomplete. The freshwater gastropod fauna faces unprecedented threats from habitat loss and degradation and introduced fishes and other pests. Unsustainable use of ground water, landscape modification and stock damage are destroying many streams and springs in rural/pastoral areas, and pose the most significant threats to the large diversity of narrow range endemics in springs and ground water. Despite comprising only of the gastropod fauna, freshwater gastropods account for of recorded mollusc extinctions. However, the status of the great majority of taxa is unknown, a situation that is exacerbated by a lack of experts and critical baseline data relating to distribution, abundance, basic life history, physiology, morphology and diet.

Simultaneously, a growing number of conflicts against large-scale wind farms are emerging in multiple locations around the world. As these processes occur, new questions arise on how electricity from wind is being generated, how such energy is flowing within societies, and how these production-flows are being shaped by specific power structures. The present paper explores the expanding geography of wind energy conflicts by analyzing 20 case studies from across the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe. Based on the Environmental Justice Atlas database, it reflects on how land pressures and patterns of uneven development emerge as two features of the current expansion of wind farms. Following a relational analysis, these patterns are examined to interpret the plural instances of opposition emerging throughout the rural spaces of the world.

The current estimates of the total number of species on earth vary from 5 to more than with a more conservative figure of species. Of these, only species have yet been described and awarded scientific names. Thus, our knowledge of diversity is remarkably incomplete. Biodiversity at any point in time is the balance between the rates of speciation and extinction. Biodiversity is not uniformly distributed on the earth and shows prominent latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. At least five major mass extinctions have occurred in the past at geologic-time boundaries. Studies indicate that we have entered into the sixth phase of mass extinctions. In all ecosystem types, terrestrial, freshwater and marine, species populations are declining. The current rates of species extinction are times higher than the background rate of year inferred from fossil record. It is now in the order of 1,000 species per decade per million species. Today we seem to be losing two to five species per hour from tropical forests alone. This amounts to a loss of populations/year or 1,800 populations/h. Major drivers for changes of biodiversity in future, in decreasing rank of their impact are land use change, climate change, N deposition, biotic exchange and atmospheric loading of CO2. Accuracy of estimates of the total number of resident species and current rates of extinction remains undetermined, and the impact of species deletions on ecosystem function and stability is still a subject of debate among ecologists. There are two basic, often complementary strategies for biodiversity conservation. The in situ strategy emphasizes the protection of ecosystems for the conservation of overall diversity of genes, populations, species, communities and the ecological processes which are crucial for ecosystem services. Establishment of networks of protected areas are effective in this regard as these have the possibility to conserve primary forests and red-listed ecosystems. The concept of biodiversity banking could induce public participation.

The Soliga cited three reasons for lantana spread: its prolific fruit output and wide seed dispersal, change in fire management, and historical extraction of grass and bamboo. The Soliga believe that lantana invasion has had negative effects on the ecosystem and their livelihoods. Tabling scientific knowledge with local knowledge has improved our understanding of lantana invasion. The role of existing lantana in colonizing neighboring areas, and the response of native tree communities to lantana were common to both local and scientific sources. However, the Soliga view provides a more nuanced perspective of the lantana-fire relationship (contextually based on lantana density) with fires suppressing lantana when lantana density was low. This is contrary to views held by foresters and biologists, that fires are uniformly detrimental and promote lantana.

These mites are usually predators and they are worldwide spread. Geographic distribution of phytoseiids in 27 biodiversity hostspots was assessed from data of the last world catalogue published in 2004. One thousand two hundred and thirty species are reported from at least one hotspot (62% of the total species number) and 604 species (30% of the total species number) are endemic to the 27 hotspots considered. The number of reports/publication in hotspot areas (2.6) is higher than in non-hotspot zones (1.5). Hotspots areas could be thus considered as a great reservoir of the Phytoseiidae diversity, just as they are for vertebrates and plants. Correlations between plant, vertebrate, mite diversity and endemism, as well as congruence rates between endemism levels of these three organisms suggest that the biodiversity patterns of plants and vertebrates mirror well those of the Phytoseiidae (both for endemicity and species richness). More intense conservation efforts in biodiversity hotspots would thus be assumed to affect plant and vertebrate biodiversity, as already known, but also arthropod biodiversity, as it was assumed.

While less densely populated, the TWAs grew at roughly twice the rate of the hotspots. Overall, slower growth rates are indicative of longer-term global trends in decreasing fertility, aging populations, and increased urbanization.

[(1997) Current Science 73: have proposed an estimate called the Avalanche Index (AI) that can incorporate the biological heterogeneity among the species in a habitat. This estimate, besides being methodologically simple, can incorporate any quantifiable differences among the species, information on species richness and their frequencies in the habitat. In this paper we have estimated AI for tree vegetation in 14 forest types across different ecosystems of the world and have compared these estimates with other indices being currently used. Through this we have attempted to analyse the relative utility of AI in discriminating the habitats based on their biological heterogeneity by capturing their intra-community biological variation. We discuss the merits and demerits of the AI as a comprehensive estimate of biological diversity.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'This study attempts to review the various biodiversity related parameters envisaged in the current national forest inventory (NFI) of India in comparison to those used worldwide as indicators of forest biodiversity. The study reveals that a good amount of biodiversity related parameters are available, covering the structural attribute of biodiversity, tree species composition, and other important functional attributes like deadwood and litter. In spite of this timber-based approach, a number of variables are available to talk on biodiversity aspects of Indian forests. However, the comparison with the parameters found in literature shows that the scope of further improvement does exist in current ability to contribute towards a documentation and management of biodiversity. Our gap analysis indicates that enhancing the capacity of the current NFI to generate overall biodiversity information urgently required for safeguarding and conserving the natural wealth of India is strongly needed.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The primary objective of this study is to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) for environment conservation and analyze factors influencing WTP. A questionnaire survey based on the contingent valuation method (CVM) was carried out at Kanas Nature Reserve, Xinjiang, China. Seventy-three percent of the 412 respondents were willing to pay at different levels, and the mean WTP value was RMB 54.60 ($8.03). The results of this survey struck an optimistic note that publics were willing to contribute to improve environmental quality. Logistic regression analysis was employed to compare the characteristics of those who were and were not willing to pay. Chi-square tests were administered to identify the relationships between various explanatory factors and WTP. Conclusions and implications of the empirical study can be provided to policy makers and site managers. In a wider sense, the findings of this study should make a good contribution to the literature related to WTP for environment conservation of natural attractions.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'A review of current work in India on modelling experiments is presented.

This evidence indicates that the likely staples were two pulses (Vigna radiata and Macrotyloma uniflorum) and two millet-grasses (Brachiaria ramosa and Setaria verticillata) which were indigenous to the Indian peninsula. At some sites there is evidence for limited cultivation of wheats (Triticum diococcum, Triticum durum/aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare), and a few crops that originated in Africa, including hyacinth bean (Lablab purpureus), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and finger millet (Eleusine coracana). In addition there is evidence for cotton (Gossypium sp.), and linseed (Linum sp.), as well as gathered fruits of Ziziphus and two Cucurbitaceae. This evidence suggests that the earliest agriculture in south India, dating to the third millennium b.c., was based on plants domesticated in the region, and that subsequently from the late 3rd millennium b.c. through the 2nd millennium additional crops from other regions were adopted into the subsistence system.'\"], [\"Abstract: ' Shorea robusta Gaertn. f.

The present study deals with delineation, mapping and characterization of various communities of Sal (Shorea robusta) forests in Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh, India ranging across over 16 districts. Field survey and visual interpretation based forest vegetation type classification and mapping was carried out as part of the project entitled characterization at landscape level using remote sensing and Indian Remote Sensing-P6 (Resourcesat-1) Linear Imaging Self Scanner-III satellite data was used during the study. The total area covered by different Sal forests was found to be approximately 2256.77 km2. Sal communities were identified and characterized based on their spectral properties, physiognomy and phytosociological characteristics. Following nine Sal communities were identified, delineated and mapped with reasonable accuracy viz., Chandar, Damar, dry plains, moist plains, western alluvium, western alluvium plains, mixed moist deciduous, mixed dry deciduous and Siwalik. It is evident from the area estimates that mixed moist deciduous Sal is the most dominant community in the region covering around (1613.90 km2), other major communities were found as western alluvium plains Sal (362.44 km2), mixed dry deciduous Sal (362.44 km2) and dry plains Sal (107.71 km2). The Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh faces tremendous anthropogenic pressure leading to deterioration of the forests.

We conducted a fully factorial nitrogen and water (three levels each) treatment field experiment in the herbivore rich South Indian Western Ghats region to determine the seasonal pattern and the extent to which nitrogen and water availability limit herbaceous production. Graminoid production was found to be nitrogen limited. Despite low rainfall, additional water did not significantly increase overall biomass production nor extend growth in the dry season. Accumulated standing biomass was highest in the late wet season (November) and lowest in the dry season (May). Leaf nitrogen was highest in the early wet season (June) and lowest in the late dry season (March). Grazing had a positive effect on grass production by extending the growing season. Biomass production and graminoid leaf nitrogen concentration levels in the study area were similar to other tropical areas in the world. Also similar to other tropical large herbivore areas, the dry season poses an annual challenge for large herbivores in the study area the smaller bodied satisfy their nutrient requirements.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The reasons behind sexual segregation in animals are many.

The aim of this study was to optimize direct shoot organogenesis (DSO), indirect shoot organogenesis (ISO) and plant regeneration of threatened medicinal plant Ceropegia santapaui, followed by analysis of genetic status and biochemical characterization of micropropagated plantlets. For optimization, cotyledonary nodes and cotyledons were used as source of explants in DSO and ISO respectively. The highest frequency of regeneration for DSO with shoots per explant was obtained from cotyledonary nodes cultured on Murashige and (MS) medium containing 2iP. The best response for callus induction and proliferation was achieved with PR (picloram) in which of cultures produced an average of (fresh weight) of callus. The highest frequency of shoot formation with an average of shoots in ISO was obtained when calli were transferred to MS medium supplemented with BAP and IBA. Regenerated shoots were best rooted in half-strength MS medium with NAA. Plantlets successfully acclimatized were morphologically indistinguishable from the source plant. Micropropagated plantlets subjected to random amplified polymorphic DNA and inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) marker based profiling reveled uniform banding pattern in DSO-derived plantlets which was similar to mother plant. ISSR fingerprints of ISO-derived plants showed low variation. Method of regeneration, plant part and solvent system significantly affected the levels of total phenolics, flavonoids and antioxidant capacity. Assay of antioxidant activity of different tissues revealed that significantly higher antioxidant activity was observed in ISO-derived tissues than DSO-derived and mother tissues.

In this paper, we present an attempt to decipher it by solving the differential equations governing the heat transfer through the lithosphere. Adequately quantifying the temperature field is very important, since it is highly dependent on the controlling thermal parameters. Thermal conductivity is modeled as a random parameter with a known mean value and correlation structure. We compute the temperatures in the crust and lithospheric mantle, along with their error bounds, using an analytical solution to the steady-state heat equation and the Adomian method of decomposition. We apply these solutions in the Archean Dharwar craton, which is divided into western Dharwar craton (WDC) and eastern Dharwar craton (EDC). We obtain a Moho temperature estimate of in WDC, whilst in EDC it is for a 20% coefficient of variability in thermal conductivity. The range of lithospheric thickness obtained for WDC is and for the EDC. These values are in agreement with other geophysical and geological findings in the region. The thermal lithosphere obtained from this study is based on the mantle solidus and the surface wave seismological studies considering radial anisotropy reveal that the lithosphere is characterized by higher shear wave velocities, and decrease at the boundary. Average shear velocity model for two different cratonic blocks (EDC and WDC) is used to show the LAB thickness for the eastern and western Dharwar craton.

Soils derived from ultramafic regoliths are generally nutrient-deficient, have major cation imbalances, and have concomitant high concentrations of potentially phytotoxic trace elements, especially nickel. The South and Southeast Asian region has the largest surface occurrences of ultramafic regoliths in the world, but the geoecology of these outcrops is still poorly studied despite severe conservation threats. Due to the paucity of systematic plant collections in many areas and the lack of georeferenced herbarium records and databased information, it is not possible to determine the distribution of species, levels of endemism, and the species most threatened. However, site-specific studies provide insights to the ultramafic geoecology of several locations in South and Southeast Asia. The geoecology of tropical ultramafic regions differs substantially from those in temperate regions in that the vegetation at lower elevations is generally tall forest with relatively low levels of endemism. On ultramafic mountaintops, where the combined forces of edaphic and climatic factors intersect, obligate ultramafic species and hyperendemics often occur. Forest clearing, agricultural development, mining, and climate change-related stressors have contributed to rapid and unprecedented loss of ultramafic-associated habitats in the region. The geoecology of the large ultramafic outcrops of Sulawesi, Obi and Halmahera, and many other smaller outcrops in South and Southeast Asia, remains largely unexplored, and should be prioritised for study and conservation.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Carbon forestry mitigation potential estimates at the global-level are limited by the absence or simplicity of national-level estimates, and similarly national-level estimates are limited by absence of regional-level estimates.

We studied bird species composition, abundance, guild composition, and site tenacity of a plot located in a cloud forest region of the Sierra Yalijux in Guatemala, half of which was primary forest and half young secondary forest (<7-years-old). Of the 100 species present 14 were restricted to the Endemic Bird Area Central American (i.e. 66% of a total of 21 endemics). Five of the 100 analysed species, including one of the restricted-range species (Troglodytes rufociliatus), had a significantly different abundance in primary and secondary forests. Theoretical analysis suggests that seven species out of a community comprised of 141 bird species are already extirpated and only three out of the 14 present restricted-range species might survive the current state of deforestation. Insectivores were the dominant guild on the plot in terms of numbers of species, followed by omnivores, frugivores and granivores. However, in terms of individuals, omnivores made up nearly half of the bird individuals in primary forest, but declined by 44% in secondary forest, whereas granivores more than doubled in this habitat type. Numbers of species per guild were not significantly different between habitats, while numbers of individuals per guild were significantly different. In general, individuals per species are significantly different in the two habitats. Results suggest that most of the species that are currently surviving in the remnant forests of the Sierra Yalijux might be fairly well adapted to a range of forest conditions, but that populations of a number of restricted-range species might be small.

However, traditional taxonomy has relied heavily on conservative plumage features to delimit white-eye species boundaries, resulting in several recent demonstrations of misclassification. Resolution of confused taxonomy is important in order to correctly delimit species and identify taxa which may require conservation, particularly in Asia where the songbird trade is decimating wild populations. In this study, we aim to untangle multiple instances of confused taxonomic treatment in three large, widespread Asian wastebasket species complexes of white-eye (Oriental White-eye Zosterops palpebrosus, Japanese White-eye Zosterops japonicus and Mountain White-eye Zosterops montanus) renowned for their conservative morphology. Using mitochondrial DNA from 173 individuals spanning 42 taxa, we uncovered extensive polyphyly in Z. palpebrosus and Z. japonicus and propose some radically revised species limits under which former members of Z. palpebrosus and Z. japonicus would be reassigned into four and two different species, respectively. The revised taxonomy results in a net loss of two previously recognized species and a net gain of two newly recognized species, leading to significant taxonomic change but a lack of additional species-level diversity. One of the newly elevated species, Zosterops melanurus from Java and Bali, is also the most heavily traded songbird and requires urgent conservation attention.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Fungal endophytes inhabit living tissues of plants without any apparent symptoms and in many cases are known to produce secondary metabolites similar to those produced by their respective host plants. However on sub-culture, the endophytic fungi gradually attenuate their ability to produce the metabolites. Attenuation has been a major constraint in realizing the potential of endophytic fungi as an alternative source of plant secondary metabolites. In this study, we report attempts to restore camptothecine (CPT) production in attenuated endophytic fungi isolated from CPT producing plants, Nothapodytes nimmoniana and Miquelia dentata when they are passed through their host plant or plants that produce CPT and when treated with a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor. Attenuated endophytic fungi that traversed through their host tissue or plants capable of synthesizing CPT, produced significantly higher CPT compared to the attenuated fungi. Attenuated fungus cultured in the presence of 5-azacytidine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, had an enhanced CPT content compared to untreated attenuated fungus. These results indicate that the attenuation of CPT production in endophytic fungi could in principle be reversed by eliciting some signals from plant tissue, most likely that which prevents the methylation or silencing of the genes responsible for CPT biosynthesis.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) rhizome has great demand in food and pharmaceutical industry.

This could be an indication of the relative prevalence of stratiform and cumuliform clouds. Rainfall was of intensity < 5 mm/hr for more than 95% of the time in Kochi in July 2002, which was a month seriously deficient in rainfall, indicating that the deficiency was probably due to the relative absence of cumuliform clouds. Cumulative distribution graphs are also plotted and fitted with the Weibull distribution. The fit parameters do not appear to have any consistent pattern. The higher intensities also contributed significantly to total rainfall most of the time, except in Munnar (a hill station).

Out of 22 10-mer RAPD primers screened, 11 were selected for comparative analysis of different species of Piper. High genetic variations were found among different Piper species studied. Among the total of 149 RAPD fragments amplified, 12 bands (8.05%) were found monomorphic in eight species. The remaining 137 fragments were found polymorphic (91.95%). Species-specific bands were found in all eight species studied. The average gene diversity or heterozygosity (H) was 0.33 across all the species, genetic distances ranged from 0.21 to 0.69.

Nine patches were selected at two sites, one with a single large 600-ha patch, the other with several small patches ranging in size from 0.2 to 60 ha. The population characteristics and community structure of small mammals were studied in relation to patch size and habitat structure within the patches. The two most abundant species were Rattus rattus individuals/ha) and Suncus montanus  individuals/ha), while the abundance of seven other species recorded were very low. The population characteristics of R. rattus examined were density, biomass, proportions of juveniles, sub-adults and adults, mean weight of all animals, mean weight of adults, sex ratio and persistence. The proportion of adults, sub-adults, mean weight of animals, and mean weight of adult males were correlated with patch size. Persistence of sub-adult females in the large patch was especially high. The density and biomass of other small-mammal species were also studied. Two indices of diversity, species richness and proportion of were compared as measures of community structure. Seven habitat characteristics were measured; of these, canopy cover, canopy height and tree density were correlated with the size of the patch. Density and biomass of species other than R. rattus and proportion of R. rattus were correlated with canopy height. Density and biomass of species other than R. rattus were highest in smaller patches. While the population characteristics of R. rattus may be affected by patch size, the density of rare species may be influenced by factors related to lower canopy height. Migration between patches may be an important factor in maintaining populations in these patches.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Most of the mountainous regions in tropical humid climatic zone experience severe soil loss due to natural factors. In the absence of measured data, modeling techniques play a crucial role for quantitative estimation of soil loss in such regions. The objective of this research work is to estimate soil loss and prioritize the sub-watersheds of Kali River basin using Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. Various thematic layers of RUSLE factors such as rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), topographic factor (LS), crop management factor (C), and support practice factor (P) have been prepared by using multiple spatial and non-spatial data sets. These layers are integrated in geographic information system (GIS) environment and estimated the soil loss. The results show that of the study area falls under low erosion risk and only area suffer from very high erosion risk. Based on the rate of soil loss, 165 sub-watersheds have been prioritized into four high, high, moderate, and low erosion risk. Anthropogenic activities such as deforestation, construction of dams, and rapid urbanization are the main reasons for high rate of soil loss in the study area. The soil erosion rate and prioritization maps help in implementation of a proper watershed management plan for the river basin.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The present study describes the floristic composition and dominance pattern of sal forests in Ranchi, Jharkhand, eastern India.

A new ant species list from a continuous mixed secondary lowland rainforest on the northern periphery of the Dja Biosphere Reserve in southeast Cameroon is presented. We investigated the effect of vegetation type on ant species density, activity and composition. Ants were collected by pitfall trapping in seven vegetation types in each of three seasons during 12 months in 2003 and Our site in Cameroon had a total observed ant diversity of 145 species. Vegetation type significantly influenced the ground-dwelling and -foraging (arboreal) ant assemblages. Differences in species density, activity and composition between vegetation types were explained not only by soil type (hydromorphous terra firme), but also by developmental stage of vegetation types. The highly inundated Raphia-swamp had the lowest ant species density and activity. Older secondary forests still had a different species composition than near primary forest even after 25 years of recovery after anthropogenic disturbance. Finally, the high ant species number captured by our pitfalls, the absence of the invasive exotic ant Wasmannia auropunctata and the high Dorylus (Anomma) army ant diversity confirm the importance of the Cameroonian rainforest for biodiversity conservation programs.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The various ways in which the forest cover may influence the atmospheric and soil processes controlling the hydrological cycle are examined.

This has lead to formulation of various policies to maintain environmental quality and sustainably manage the coastal resources. Basically, the coastal zone needs to address the demands of all the stakeholders starting from traditional local communities, administrators, to academic researchers etc. India has faced tremendous challenges in implementing regulatory measures like Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) issued in 1991 by demarcating countries coast in to four different zones with provisions and prohibitions for various activities. The concept of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) has been taken with the support of spatial decision-support tools derived from satellite data including national programmes on inter-sectoral approaches towards ICZM. 2004 onwards a series of disasters have reminded the necessity of having regulatory measures through implementable approaches. Subsequently, the CRZ 2011 notification has been a new addition to the list of policies using bottom-up approach as a good governance tool. The country has strengthened its potential in coastal management, disaster management and several community based field projects to enhance participation of stakeholders.

It offers opportunities to address global issues at the national level through locally grown solutions and measures. This article reviews the national challenges and opportunities in meeting requirements of the CBD by analysing twenty Third National Reports (TNRs), covering five different CBD regional clusters from the three global economic groups. While there is a plethora of challenges, the predominant ones discussed in this study include: institutional and capacity, knowledge and accessible information, economic policy and financial resources, cooperation and stakeholder involvement, and mainstreaming and integration of biodiversity. The underlying problem is that limited capacity in developing countries and transition economies undermines conservation initiatives. Lack of capacity in science, coordination, administration, legislation, and monitoring are barriers to on-ground implementation of biodiversity programmes. Opportunities to overcome these challenges embrace use of knowledge products, information-sharing mechanisms, participatory platforms, educational programmes, multi-level governance, and policy coherence. Innovative market-based instruments are also being trialled in various countries, which seek to offer incentives to local communities. The article concludes that conservation measures should be supported by multiple sectors and secure high level political support. Political, economical, and legislative sectors are more likely to show interest in CBD implementation and use it as a tool for managing biodiversity when they know the Convention processes and perceive it as a benefit. Modest investments in capacity building and training, and engaging different sectors in setting priorities would have a significant pay-off.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'High densities of people living around protected areas (PAs) in South Asia require management strategies to balance conservation goals and livelihood needs. Based on a survey of 777 households around five PAs in India and Nepal, this paper provides a comparative perspective of Indian and Nepali views of protected area benefits and costs, their attitude toward conservation in general, and attitude toward protected area staff. Results indicate mixed responses towards tourism, varying from very favorable in Nepal to less favorable in India. The majority (81%) held positive attitudes towards the existence and importance of PAs but had negative perceptions of PA staff (69%). Most residents perceived benefits from access to fuel wood, fodder and other PA resources including benefits from tourism, while crop and livestock losses from wildlife were the main costs. Households overall positive attitudes towards the PAs and conservation despite high losses from living around PAs suggests that local residents may support conservation if their livelihood needs are met. Comparisons of household attitudes and perceptions suggest that locally based strategies rather than top-down approaches are likely to be more effective. Extending PA benefits to smaller landholders, households that are highly resource-dependent or experiencing higher income losses from human-wildlife conflicts, and less educated residents are particularly important to balance costs and losses from living around protected areas.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Ecotourism is increasingly being promoted as an instrument that helps local socio-economic development and generate revenues to strengthen conservation of critically endangered biodiversity. It is often posited the magic bullet particularly across protected areas in the Global South. In theory, ecotourism can provide economic benefits to economically weaker communities living around protected areas and inspire them to protect the biodiversity in their own interest. This paper, however, provides empirical evidence that the so-called is not an unqualified truism. With a case study on Sundarban Biosphere Reserve, largest mangrove biodiversity and home of highly endangered Royal Bengal Tiger, this article examines complexities involved in ecotourism and urges the need to make it context-specific. It assesses ability to provide livelihood alternatives to local communities and how can it help in conservation. The findings demonstrate an unequal, uneven, and skewed accumulation of benefits of ecotourism, often associated with market mechanisms of global environmental protection. As little as 36% of the interviewees claimed receiving direct or indirect benefits from ecotourism, the study finds. It failed to offer any benefits at all to the poorest and most marginal communities. On the contrary, it offered disproportionately larger returns to the remotely located capital invested in the local ecotourism facilities in the Sundarbans, thus defeating the principle behind the mechanism. In the area of conservation, tourism was blamed for increasing pollution and harming the health of the ecosystem by tourists who were considered and insensitive to the ecology by the locals and conservation agencies alike.'\"], [\"tissue culture plants '\"], [\"Abstract: ' Nothapodytes nimmoniana Graham is an important medicinal tree species occurring in the Western Ghats, a mega diversity hotspot in Southern India.

In this paper, we report the development of a rapid, high frequency regeneration protocol from leaf and nodal explants of N. nimmoniana. Multiple shoot induction was carried out using leaf and nodal explants on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different concentration/combination of phyto-hormones. N6-benzyladenine (BA) was the most effective cytokinin for the induction of multiple shoots. The MS medium with BA yielded the highest number of shoots from leaf and nodal explants, respectively. Further, proliferation and elongation of adventitious buds were observed in secondary medium containing MS supplemented with BA and gibberellic acid (GA3). Shoots were rooted on half strength MS medium containing indole-3-butyric acid. The plantlets were acclimatized in a growth chamber at relative humidity, with light/dark photoperiod. Regenerated plants were free of any noticeable phenotypic variability and showed a survival rate of The in vitro regenerated plants accumulated substantial amount of camptothecine (ranging from 0.08 to These results suggest the possibility of using in vitro regenerated plants as a possible alternative source of CPT.

Both larvae and adults are predators. The order is relatively well studied, and the actual number of species may be close to 7,000. Many species have small distributional ranges, and are habitat specialists, including inhabitants of alpine mountain bogs, seepage areas in tropical rain forests, and waterfalls. They are often successfully used as indicators for environmental health and conservation management. The highest diversity is found in flowing waters in rain forests of the tropics, the Oriental and Neotropical regions being the most speciose. This paper discusses diversity, summarises the biogeography of dragonflies in the different biogeographical regions and gives the total number of species and genera per family per biogeographical region. Examples are given of areas of particular diversity, in terms of areas of endemism, presence of ancient lineages or remarkable recent radiations but no well-based review of areas with high endemism of dragonflies is available so far.

Legumes are the primary source of dietary proteins in many developing countries, where protein hunger and malnutrition are widespread. Grain legumes germplasm constitute ~15% of the accessions preserved globally. Nearly, 78% of the accessions, have been characterized, compared to 34% of national genebank collections. Interestingly, limited data on grain quality are available as the primary focus has been on morpho-agronomic traits. Clearly, more resources should be targeted on biochemical evaluation to identify nutritionally rich and genetically diverse germplasm. The formation of core and mini core collections has provided crop breeders with a systematic yet manageable entry point into global germplasm resources. These subsets have been reported for most legumes and have proved useful in identifying new sources of variation. They may however not eliminate the need to evaluate entire collections, particularly for very rare traits. Molecular characterization and association mapping will further aid to insights into the structure of legume diversity and facilitate greater use of collections. The use of high resolution elevational climate models has greatly improved our capacity to characterize plant habitats and adaptive responses to stresses. Evidence suggests that there has been increased use of wild relatives as well as new resources resulting from mutagenesis to enhance the genetic base of legume cultigens.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Participation is the initiation and continuance of an active process by which beneficiary groups influence the direction and execution of development activity.

Overall, forest interior species richness and abundance increased significantly with increasing patch size but edge species richness did not. Species richness and abundance of shade-tolerant and shade-demanding tree species also increased with increasing patch size. The abundance of zoochory dispersed tree species was significantly related to increasing patch size, but those dispersed by autochory did not display any clear relationship between patch size and species richness or abundance. Our findings suggest that with increasing forest patch area, tree compositional patterns may be driven by species specific shade-tolerance adaptations and dispersal patterns.

Cluster analysis revealed three major groups associated with specific environmental characteristics: (1) P. roxburghii (2) Pinus-Quercus baloot and (3) Pinus-Olea ferruginea community types. NMS-ordination showed the major gradient as an amalgam of elevation (r 2 = 0.441, p <0.01) and slope (r 2 = 0.391, p <0.05) as the two topographic factors correlated with species distribution. The first ordination axis also showed positive correlation with soil variables like pH and electrical conductivity, suggesting that soil chemistry was related to topographic characteristics and probably acted as a secondary gradient. We also examined size class distributions, age structures and growth rates of the three communities in order to describe community development and dynamics. Total tree density was 14700 plants/ha, with P. roxburghii having a relative density of 82% to 100%. Density of juvenile and total density and basal area of the subordinate tree species were low. The low density of trees in the smallest diameter size-class suggested that the recruitment of small P. roxburghii plants into the adult population may be lower than the required replacement rate for the stands. Pooled size-class distributions for the species showed a multimodal pattern with some regeneration gaps. Browsing, heavy logging and other anthropogenic activities were the overriding factors responsible for the poor recruitment of P. roxburghii. We concluded from the age structure that the forests were characterized by the dominance of young trees. Growth rate analysis revealed that P. roxburghii was the fastest growing species among the conifers species in Pakistan.

Apex predator conservation requires identifying factors underlying distribution, so we used multi-scale maximum entropy modelling with sampling bias correction to investigate a broad suite of relevant ecological, climatic and anthropogenic factors in order to identify potentially suitable leopard habitat. Presence locations were determined from of surveys, observations and verified reports. The best bias correction procedure and scale were uncertain, so we employed a novel method of using information from all models across analyses to determine top models and identify influential variables. Leopard presence was most strongly linked to the landscape proportion encompassed by Protected Areas strictly limiting human presence, with more porous Protected Areas less influential. All three forest composition and configuration metrics investigated (area weighted mean patch size, patch density and forest connectivity) were influential, with increased patch size and higher connectivity predicting better habitat suitability for leopards.

The forest stands were selected based on the disturbance index (the basal area of the cut trees measured at ground level expressed as a fraction of the total basal area of all trees including felled ones): (i) undisturbed stand (0% disturbance index), (ii) mildly disturbed (20% disturbance index), (iii) moderately disturbed (40% disturbance index), and (iv) highly disturbed stand (70% disturbance index). Tree species richness varied along the disturbance gradient in different stands. The mildly disturbed stand showed the highest species richness (54 of 51 genera). Species richness was lowest (16 of 16 genera) in the highly disturbed stand. In the undisturbed stand, 47 species of 42 genera were recorded while in the moderately disturbed stand 42 species of 36 genera were found. The diversity index for tree species ranged from 0.7 to 2.02 in all the stands. The highest tree diversity was recorded in the undisturbed stand and the lowest in the highly disturbed stand. The stands differed with respect to the tree species composition at the family and generic level. Fagaceae, Dipterocarpaceae and Clusiaceae dominated over other families and contributed 53% in the undisturbed, 51% in the mildly disturbed, 42% in the moderately disturbed and 49% in the highly disturbed forest stands to the total density of the respective stand. Stand density was highest (5452 stems in the undisturbed stand, followed by the mildly disturbed stand (5014), intermediate (3656) in the moderately disturbed stand and lowest (338) in the highly disturbed stand. Dominance, calculated as the importance value index of different species, varied greatly across the stands. The highest stand density and species richness were represented in the medium girth class cm) in all the stands. In the undisturbed stand, the highest density was found in the cm girth class, while in the mildly disturbed stand the cm girth range recorded the highest density. About 55, 68 and 52% species were found to be regenerating in the undisturbed, mildly disturbed and moderately disturbed stands, respectively. No regeneration was recorded in the highly disturbed stand.

The high fluoride content is an endemic problem in the area and special attention was attached to the point. The chemical compositions of the ground water of the area are dominated by CaCl, NaCl and mixed CaMgCl types in pre-monsoon and CaHCO3-mixed CaMgCl type in post-monsoon. This is largely due to chemical weathering of Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt rock types. Increasing alkalinity vis-a-vis F concentration in pre-monsoon is associated with sodium-bicarbonate water types having high pH (>7) and low calcium and magnesium contents. The percentage of total high fluoride containing water samples is nearly double in pre-monsoon than in post-monsoon. During both the seasons, pH values indicate mildly alkaline to weakly acidic nature of the water samples. Fluoride concentration has good correlation with pH in pre-monsoon whereas in post-monsoon it shows good correlation with Fe. Facies analysis indicates that water is becoming predominantly Ca-Na cation and Cl-SO4-HCO3 anion type in premonsoon than Ca-Mg type and HCO3-Cl-SO4 type in post-monsoon.

However, their characteristics differ from region to region. Flooding behavior and their management at national level have been investigated in this article. Floods are caused mainly due to the extreme spatial and temporal variation in the quantity of rainfall and meteorological conditions during monsoon season About 80% of the total annual rainfall is concentrated during the period, resulting in a very high discharge from rivers, causing extensive damage to life and property. The National Flood Control Program has been launched in the country in the year 1954. Since then, sizeable progress has been made in structural and non-structural flood protection measures. Structural measures involve the construction of physical structures like embankments, dams, drainage channels, and reservoirs that prevent flood waters from reaching potential damage centers, whereas non-structural measures like flood forecasting aim at improving the preparedness to floods by keeping people away from flood waters. Institutional and legal setup to mitigate the impacts of floods has evolved over the years. Nevertheless, statistics do not reveal major reduction in the flood damages.

Remote sensing data provides an opportunity for better observation and systematic analysis of terrain conditions following the synoptic and multi-spectral coverage. In the present study, the geomorphological analysis reveals that various denudational and depositional landforms have been analysed and mapped. The soil depth ranges from extremely shallow in isolated mounds to very deep in the pediplains. Based on the slope gradient, morphometry, soil depth, vegetation cover and image characteristics of standard FCC imagery of IRS-1D LISS-III data, four categories of eroded lands i.e., very severe, severe, moderate and nil to slight have been identified and mapped. The integrated analysis of slope, geomorphology and degraded lands layers in GIS revealed that the pediplains, rolling plains and subdued plateau are associated with very severe land degradation and accounts for 6.05%, 3.85% and 3.47% of total area respectively. The analysis of percentage of degraded lands at geomorphic sub unit level indicates that severe land degradation process is dominant in the dissected ridges, isolated mounds, escarpments and plateau spurs. The remote sensing data and GIS based detailed geomorphological and degraded lands analysis ensure better understanding of landform-eroded lands relationship and distribution to assess the status of land degradation at micro geomorphic unit for reclamation, geo-environmental planning and management.

We used multi-resolution satellite images to assess the long term deforestation from 2001 to2009 and also to identify episodic forest cutting areas appeared during the conflict period of Oct. 2008. There are only 58 ha of deforestation identified during the conflict period while 1268 ha of gross annual deforestation were assessed during last eight years. Most of the deforestation patches persist around the administrative boundaries at sub-district levels (tehsils) which can be attributed to ambiguity in unclear jurisdiction between the forest official. The results highlight that the forest cutting appeared in Swat and Shangla during the conflict period is not as significant when compared with the long term deforestation pattern in the area. On the one side the results of the study are supportive to the picture that emerges from international studies which report high rate of deforestation in the country and on the other side it negates any relation between the security situation and the increasing deforestation in the north western Pakistan.

The geomorphology, water quality and biological productivity of the lake had undergone significant changes over the years under the influence of natural events and anthropogenic interventions. Decades of research have shown that the ecological changes of the lake system and its fisheries were influenced mainly by the water exchange between the lake and the sea that controls the salinity, siltation, macrophyte infestation and recruitment of marine forms. Depletion of fisheries and loss of biodiversity in 1980s and 1990s have been linked to the northward shifting of inlet and silting up of the outer channel. In order to improve the health of the lagoon and restoration of its biodiversity, a new mouth was dredged open in September 2000. Opening of the new mouth has resulted in some improvements with substantial increase in capture fishery, reduction in weed infestation, growth of seagrasses, appearance of dolphins and increase in the population of migratory birds.

Henceforth, the present paper aims to provide a critical review on the management of invasive species particularly in the context of forest plants. Plant invasion in forest is now increasingly being recognized as a global problem, and various continents are adversely affected, although to a differential scale. Quest for the ecological mechanism lying behind the success of invasive species over native species of forest has drawn the attention of researches worldwide particularly in the context of relationship. Transport, colonization, establishment, and landscape spread may be different steps in success of invasive plants in forest, and each and every step is checked through several ecological attributes. Further, several ecological attribute and hypothesis (enemy release, novel weapon, empty niche, evolution of increased competitive ability, etc.) were proposed pertaining to success of invasive plant species in forest ecosystems. However, a single theory will not be able to account for invasion success among all environments as it may vary spatially and temporally. Therefore, in order to formulate a sustainable management plan for invasive plants of forest, it is necessary to develop a synoptic view of the dynamic processes involved in the invasion process. Moreover, invasive species of forest can act synergistically with other elements of global change, including land-use change, climate change, increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and nitrogen deposition.

The variable area transect was significantly more efficient per unit effort in the field than the fixed area square plot. In the simulation tests both methods performed equally well under random spatial distribution. However, under simulated aggregated distribution both methods were positively biased (square plot up to 12% at low density, variable area transect at all densities), and under simulated regular distribution the variable area transect was slightly negatively biased to at medium to high density).

The reliability of correct species identification by the trained listener was 100 % for 16 out of 20 species tested in the laboratory. The reliability of identifying the numbers of individuals correctly was 100% for 13 out of 20 species. The human listener performed slightly better than the instrument in detecting low frequency and broadband calls in the field, whereas the recorder detected high frequency calls with greater probability. To address the problem of pseudoreplication during spot sampling in the field, we monitored the movement of calling individuals using focal animal sampling. The average distance moved by calling individuals for 17 out of 20 species was less than in half an hour. We suggest that trained sampling is preferable for crickets and low frequency katydids, whereas broadband recorders are preferable for katydid species with high frequency calls for accurate estimation of ensiferan species richness and relative abundance in an area.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Environmental, biological, socio-cultural and economic status variation existing in the Central Himalaya have led to the evolution of diverse and unique traditional agroecosystems, crop species and livestock, which facilitate the traditional mountain farming societies to sustain themselves. Indigenous agroecosystems are highly site specific and differ from place to place, as they have evolved along divergent lines. For maintenance of traditional agrodiversity management the farmers of the Central Himalaya have evolved various types of crop rotations in consonance with the varied environmental conditions and agronomic requirements. In irrigated flat lands two crops are harvested in a year with negligible fallow period but in rainfed conditions if a cropping sequence is presumed to be starting after winter fallow phase then four major cropping seasons can be identified namely first kharif season (first crop season), first rabi season (second crop season), second kharif season (third crop season) and second rabi season (fourth crop season). Highest crop diversity is present in kharif season in comparison to rabi season. Traditionally the fields are left fallow after harvest of the second kharif season crop. Important characteristics of agrodiversity management are the use of bullocks for draught power, human energy as labour, crop residues as animal feed and animal waste mixed with forest litter as organic input to restore soil fertility levels. Women provide most of the human labour except for ploughing and threshing grain. The present study deals with assessment of traditional agrodiversity management such as (i) crop diversity, (ii) realized yield under the traditional practices and (iii) assess the differences of realized yields under sole and mixed cropping systems. It indicated that crop rotation is an important feature of the Central Himalayan village ecosystem which helps to continue the diversity of species grown, as are the distribution of crops in the growing period and the management of soil fertility. The cropping diversity existing and the sequences practiced by the traditional farmers seems to have achieved high degree of specialization and thus even when the yield/biomass variations are about 60%, the farmers continue to practice these sequences as they need to maintain diversity and synergistic relationships of crops in addition to manage the food and labour requirements for crop husbandry. Crop yields are generally higher in irrigated systems than rainfed systems and in sole cropping as compared with mixed cropping. However, gross biological and economic yields are higher in mixed cropping than sole cropping systems.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Realizing the potential of spaceborne multispectral measurements in providing spatial information on natural resources, and of Geographic Information System (GIS) in integrating such information with the socio-economic data and other collateral information to arrive at derivative information, we report here the results of a study which was taken up in a watershed in Charkhari block of Mahoba district, northern India, to generate the information on natural resources from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-1B) Linear Imaging Self-scanning Sensor (LISS-II) images through a systematic visual interpretation, and its subsequent integration with the collateral information in a GIS environment to develop optimal land use plan/action plan for sustainable development of its land resources.

The use of Deccan basalts and trachyte in the range of Indian architectonic heritage, from antiquity to current times, is quite fascinating. The abundance and ease of workability of Deccan Trap rocks render them the most preferred building material in all the architectonic heritage structures that document various cultural and ethnic habitations in the west central India.

This paper aims to understand the interlocking of formal and informal seed supply routes by considering the dynamic flow of seeds within networks across the intersections of gender, ethnicity and age in South India as social categories structuring relations. This changing relationship under formal and informal institutional settings has consequences on performance for men and women in rice seed systems. Undertaking an empirical analysis of the organization of seed management and exchange, we seek to shed light on the gendered organization of agrobiodiversity as a social network. The study builds on Net-Map interviews conducted in 2012, embedded in the larger BioDIVA project in the district of Wayanad in Kerala, India. Based on network analysis, the interactive method employed has enabled identification of important actors in the seed system and the characteristics of their relationships. We look into the gendered structure of information exchange regarding seed varieties and actual seed transactions, while also examining clusters of actors collaborating regarding seed supply. Finally, we identify the institutional gap concerning seed sources left by formal and informal institutions, like the availability of varieties. We show how informal and formal seed systems coexist and overlap due to actors moving between systems and argue that the degree and areas of overlap are shaped by gendered relations.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Multiple shoots were obtained on MS medium containing'\"], [\"Abstract: 'A survey of anthropological, archaeological, botanical, and historical literature reveals that two species of fox-tail millet were domesticated in the Old World (S. italica, S. pumila), and one may have been domesticated in the New World (S. parviflora).

Analyses showed that the concentrations of Mg2+ exceeded Ca2+ in both the seasons suggesting silicate weathering as a source of ions. Average values contribute 73.53% of total cations and signify the major supply of mafic minerals. Elevated TDS and TH limit drinking potential and other beneficial uses indicate permanently hard water. The average concentrations of the anions were found within Indian PL except NO3, attributed to use of fertilizers. The spatial distribution maps show the EC, Mg, Na, Cl, and SO4 to be generally higher for both the seasons in flood plain deposits than denuded landforms and middle-level/high-level plateaus containing fractured basalt aquifers. It is confirmed that silicate weathering is the dominant process followed by carbonate weathering. Inputs of TDS, Cl, SO4, Mg, Na, and NO3 are influenced by rainfall and human activities. Groundwater sample numbers 20, 37, and 38 have been severely impacted from agricultural runoff as these samples are located along the surface water flow path. The high loading of TDS and TH is controlled by the Mg, Na, Cl, and SO4 ions. Elevated concentration of Na over Ca represents the ion exchange between Ca and Na. High contents of Mg, Na, Cl, and SO4 corroborate that the groundwater is influenced by anthropogenic sources.

An estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) occurs at sea-end stations during when river discharge is high and also in when river discharge is low. These are the two windiest times of year, the former associated with the southwest monsoon and the latter characterized by a persistent sea breeze. The salinity vs. SPM plot shows that high SPM is a seaward deposit and skewed landward. Suspended matter comprised of floccules, fecal pellets, and aggregates that consist of clay and biogenic particles occur everywhere in the estuary. Diatoms are the most common and are of marine type at the sea-end and freshwater-dominated at river-end stations of the estuary. SPM is characterized by kaolinite- and smectite-rich clay mineral suites at the river- and sea-end stations, respectively. Smectite concentrations increase seawards with the increase in SPM content and are not influenced by salinity. Wind-driven waves and currents and biogeochemical processes at the mouth of estuary likely play an important role in the formation of ETM in resuspension and transformation of SPM into floccules and aggregates and in their upkeep or removal.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Shoot multiplication of Curculigo orchioides Gaertn (Kali Musali), a threatened medicinal herb, was achieved using shoot bud explants.

In many cases, even though indigenous people rely substantially on aquatic resources, environmental flows have been assumed to be an acceptable surrogate for the protection of indigenous interests. This paper argues that the need to adapt flow assessments to account for linkages and dependencies between people and rivers is equally applicable to developed world indigenous contexts such as Australia as it is to developing countries where there has been some attempt to address indigenous or subsistence water requirements. We propose three challenges to conventional environmental flow assessments that, if met, will improve the ability of water resource planning to address indigenous interests. The first challenge is to recognize that in an indigenous context a different suite of species may be considered important when compared to those valued by other stakeholders. Although conservation status or rarity may be important, it is common and widespread species that make substantial contributions to indigenous household incomes through customary use. The second challenge is to accommodate a different set of management objectives in environmental flow allocation. Environmental flows will need to meet the requirement of hunting and fishing activities at rates that are socially and economically sustainable. The third and arguably most theoretically challenging task is for environmental flow assessments to take into account indigenous worldviews and the quality of relationships that are significant in indigenous cultures. Meeting these three challenges to environmental flow assessment will assist water management agencies and other practitioners to protect indigenous interests as water allocation decisions are made.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'We identified 67 and 21 NTFP-yielding plant and animal species, respectively, in a reserve forest in Cachar district of Assam.

Reasons for such expansions are numerous, including fire suppression. An important example of this problem is the native montane grassland in the Nilgiris of the Western Ghats in India, a biodiversity hotspot threatened by invasion of multiple woody species. In this study, the impacts of the highly invasive, nitrogen fixing exotic shrub Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) on the grassland community and ecosystem function have been quantified and the role of fire as a potential management tool evaluated. I established paired plots in uninvaded and broom-invaded grasslands that were either unburned or burned by an unplanned wildfire event. Invasion negatively impacted the grassland community structure and composition, favoring shade tolerant and weedy native plants, but did not greatly alter ecosystem function. Burning broom patches to eliminate the stands resulted in lower soil moisture and nitrogen levels after the fire. Yet, there were no notable fire effects on the grassland communities or ecosystem properties. Taken together, the results suggest that fire might be an effective tool for broom control.

The landforms of Mumbai Island have been shaped by a combination of fluvial, denudational and marine processes. These landforms are categorized into two broad zones on the basis of its influence in groundwater occurrence. Denudational landforms are categorized as runoff zones whereas the other two are categorized as storage zones. This classification is on the basis of occurrence and storage of groundwater.

Hypocotyl explants induced hairy roots at a higher frequency than cotyledons when infected with the most virulent strain TR105. The explants co-cultivated in half-strength salts and vitamins of Murashige and Skoog basal medium (half-MSB) induced hairy roots either directly from the wounds or followed by the formation of gall like structures. Irrespective of the explants, the strain MTCC 532 induced callus alone. The root initials on the galls proliferated vigorously and elongated more rapidly when they were segmented and subcultured on half-MSB medium than the proliferation and elongation of directly emerged roots. The established hairy roots showed intermittent gall formation which was the active sites for hairy roots induction. The molecular evidence of rol A and rol C gene integration was confirmed by PCR amplification  and southern blot hybridization. Growth of the hairy roots was undertaken by measuring root growth unit after culturing root tips in half-MSB solid medium and determined fresh weight/dry weight/conductivity during time-course study in shake flask cultures. The maximum biomass and accumulation of the root specific compound, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzaldehyde (MBALD) dry weight), was recorded at the 6th week of growth, which was more than that observed in normal root cultures dry weight).'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Micropropagation of Embelia ribes was achieved through proliferation of axillary shoots obtained from mature plants.

Such systems often have a large diversity of fauna and flora and provide local and regional ecosystem services. Shade trees are, however, being removed to increase crop production in many tropical regions. There is little knowledge on the effect of shade trees on crop production in the context of trade-offs with other management practices. We therefore compared the benefits of exotic versus native shade trees on coffee production. We evaluated the importance of shade tree management for crop production in the context of management practices. Management practices included fertilization, liming, coffee pruning, weeding, and irrigation in 113 coffee agroforests in Kodagu, India, over a wide range of shade tree density, tree species diversity, and shade cover. We studied, in particular, Grevillea and non-Grevillea shade trees, the latter including mostly native tree species. Results show that a rise of 100 non-Grevillea shade tree per hectare increased production of berries by and larger beans by Irrigation and liming increased berry production respectively by 16 and These management interventions are likely to offset the relatively small negative effect of reducing shade density of non-Grevillea trees on coffee production.

This study outlines the induction and successive maturation stages of D. aqueum somatic embryos (SEs). The tTCLs (~ 0.5 mm thick) cultured on halfstrength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing cytokinins and auxins, either individually or in combination, produced embryogenic callus (EC). Treatment with 0.5 mg dm-3 zeatin induced EC in 41.42 % of tTCLs. As many as 42.66 globular SEs per tTCL were formed in the presence of 1.5 mg dm-3N6-(2-isopentyl) adenine (2iP) but only on 10.33 % of explants. The combined treatment of 2iP (1.5 mg dm-3) and 0.5 mg dm-3 6-benzyladenine resulted in 34 globular SEs on 14.7 % of tTCLs whereas the combination of 2iP and 1.0 mg dm-3 indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) induced 7.4 globular SEs on 52.33 % of tTCLs. Supplementation of activated charcoal, amino acids, and antioxidants alleviated browning at all the concentrations tested, but the EC response declined. The addition of 0.5 mg dm-3 polyvinylpyrrolidone to 1.5 mg dm-3 2iP and 1.0 mg dm-3 IBA produced 24 SEs on 19.89 % of tTCLs suggesting that the EC and SEs can be effectively induced by individual cytokinins whereas the synergistic treatments with other compounds can only enhance the induction of EC. Histological observations of EC showed the formation of globular SEs from sub-epidermal regions. Successive developmental stages of globular SEs and the intermediate stage of protocorm like bodies until the formation of plantlets were observed. The plantlets obtained through SEs showed no morphological variations, and inter simple sequence repeat profiles also confirmed the genetic fidelity of in vitro-derived progeny with high monomorphism (97.78 %).

This study characterizes the micro watersheds in the Palar sub-watershed using morphometric analysis and assesses its risk by land use and land cover features in a particular micro watershed. Palar sub-watershed is divided into 6 micro watersheds for prioritization based on morphometric and land use analysis. Several morphometric parameters (linear, shape and relief) are determined from the drainage map; ranks are assigned based on their capacity to induce erodability and degradation. Final ranking is based on the composite index calculated from the sum of the ranks of each morphometric parameter. Morphometric analysis reveals micro watersheds 5 and 6 as most susceptible and 2 and 3 as low susceptible. Land use is mapped using IRS ID LISS III satellite data. The risk in terms of watershed degradation involved to each micro watershed is based on the ranks of each land use feature, obtained from a similar composite index as that of morphometric analysis. Land use analysis shows that micro watersheds 2 and 4 fall under high priority category while 5 and 6 under low priority category. Integration of the morphometric and land use analysis shows that only micro watershed 1 falls under the same category in both analyses. Control measures are suggested to contain degradation depending on its specific land use pattern and morphometric features. This study can be used to prepare a comprehensive watershed plan for the development or for planning resource conservation strategies, by integrating land use features with the drainage characteristics of the region, in particular for a hill ecosystem as the prioritization is at micro level.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Long before the applications of Science and Technology for conservation of biodiversity and sustainable development became a recognized field of human endeavour, there have been attempts by individuals and institutions who had the commitment and wisdom to begin the effort.

Though studies have traditionally focused on females, males have received increasing attention in recent years. We compared relationships in lion-tailed macaques and bonnet macaques. Because bonnet macaques have a high adult male:female sex ratio and are seasonal breeders whereas lion-tailed macaques have a low adult male:female sex ratio and are largely aseasonal breeders, we predicted that bonnet macaque males would be spatially and socially more tolerant of each other and would have less linear dominance relationships than lion-tailed macaques. We recorded and relationships in 1 group of wild macaques of each species via scan sampling and sampling. The results revealed that lion-tailed macaque males largely remained at a distance from each other whereas bonnet macaque males remained in close proximity to one another. Lion-tailed macaque males were more agonistic toward each other whereas bonnet macaque males showed more affiliative interactions.

We collected data (home range size, canopy use, activity budgets, diet, and niche breadth and overlap) using GPS and scan/focal animal sampling methods on 2 groups of Presbytis potenziani and 3 groups of Simias concolor living in a mixed primary rain forest in northern Siberut. Results show that home ranges of the 2 species overlapped completely and that the home range size of Presbytis potenziani was ca. 4 times larger than that of Simias concolor. Lower canopy levels were used more often by Simias concolor, whereas Presbytis potenziani preferred the canopy Apart from foraging and other activities, there was little difference in overall activity budgets of the 2 species. Regarding diet, although 60% of all food species examined were used by both langur species, they shared only 3 of the 10 most commonly eaten species. Presbytis potenziani fed more selectively on fruits, whereas Simias concolor fed predominantly on leaves. niche breadth indices revealed that the diet of Simias concolor is more general (0.34) than that of Presbytis potenziani (0.22).

The comparison with the Hydrological Discharge (HD) model shows large improvements in simulating the correct amount of freshwater river discharge over the Bay of Bengal (BoB), one of the fundamental factor responsible for the formation of the shallow barrier layer (BL) over the BoB. However, the improvements in river discharge do not have a clear effect on the BL due to excessive mixing in the ocean model.

Traditional institutions with hierarchal structure were found in all states and are intact and functional in the state of Meghalaya. Quasi-traditional institutions, a blend of traditional and modern institutions were prevalent in Nagaland while modern institutions have almost replaced traditional institutions in Mizoram. We recorded at least eleven types of community forests viz., group of village forest, village forest, restricted forest, sacred forest, clan forest, cemetery forest, regeneration forest, bamboo forest, recreation forest, village reserved forest and medicinal plantation in villages of three states. The tribal people, through long-term trial and error experiments, have developed an elaborate, functional and generally democratic system of conservation and management of forests and associated natural ecosystems. Several forest and natural resource management lessons can be learnt from the institutional structure and decision making system of the evolving and dynamic institutions of tribal communities of the region.'\"], [\"Abstract: ' I present the results of a 2-year experiment comparing seed predation, seed germination, and seedling survivorship patterns of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata in forest fragments and continuous forest. These empirical results were compared with natural patterns of recruitment in permanent demographic plots adjacent to experimental areas. The number of naturally occurring seedlings established in demographic plots was times greater in continuous forest than it was in 1-ha or 10-ha fragments. This result mirrors the pattern of seedling establishment in experimental transects, in which seeds in fragments were times less likely to become established than those in continuous forest. Predation of experimentally sown seeds was extremely low at all sites, and is therefore not responsible for the observed pattern. Instead, reductions in seedling abundance in forest fragments are probably due to lower levels of seed germination. Forest fragments have higher air and soil temperatures, lower relative humidity, and increased leaf-litter accumulation, all of which can alter the cues used to initiate germination. While the growth of seedlings was similar in forest fragments and continuous forest, seedling survivorship in fragments was highly variable. These results suggest that altered environmental conditions may exacerbate reductions in plant recruitment resulting from modified plant-animal interactions. Strategies aimed at reducing the intensity of abiotic edge effects should therefore be incorporated into plant conservation efforts.'\"], ['Abstract: Abstract not available'], [\"Abstract: 'Dam removal has been increasingly reported globally and is becoming an important approach for river management, restoration and environmental conservation in damming rivers. However, current limited knowledge of global trends in dam removal and related research may be potentially biased in terms of the geographic distribution and organisms studied. Such bias could mislead dam removal planning and management in different areas and ecological conservation for different taxa. In this study, we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed datasets of dam removal and publications of dam removal research using bibliometric methods. A total of 1449 dam removal documents were published from 1953 to 2016. Trends, current hotspots and future directions of dam removal research were identified. The results from this study reveal that dam removal largely occurred in the North America and Europe, and most of the removed dams were small and old dams. With respect to the topic analysis, more dam removal studies should focus on the responses of a wide range of organisms, not only fish, as well as the interspecies relationships, food webs and ecosystem structures and functions.

Progress achieved for understanding essential biodiversity variables with reference to species populations, species traits, community composition, ecosystem function and ecosystem structure have been reviewed. Studies mostly focused on remote sensing based biodiversity indicators in understanding of land cover, forest cover, forest type, fragmentation, biological richness, carbon stocks, fires and protected area monitoring at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Fine resolution understanding with reference to vegetation structure, function, distribution of threatened, endemic and invasive species is required for effective conservation strategies.

In two common woody plant genera (Acacia and Grevillea) in southeastern Australia, we examined the size and location of the residual seed bank after fire across areas of varying seedling densities at three locations in comparison to the distribution of seeds in the soil at an unburnt site. We found viable dormant seeds remaining in the soil after fire (evidence of residual soil seed bank). A significantly lower proportion of seeds remained in the top of soil than at or soil depths, independent of seedling density or plant genus. This was due to greater germination, and possibly some seed mortality, near the soil surface. Reduced germination below was probably due to the reduced efficacy of the fire cues that break seed dormancy, a declining ability of seeds to emerge successfully from such depths, and the lower abundance of seeds in the soil at such depths. The magnitude of the residual seed bank was similar across and soil depths in Acacia suaveolens. For two Grevillea species, most residual seeds were at and The residual soil seed bank in the top of soil after fire varied across sites with estimates of 0, 19 and 27% in G. speciosa and 23, 35, and 55% in A. suaveolens. At two sites, both species had similar residual seed bank sizes, while at a third, there were large differences between the species The observed patterns imply that the fire-related cues that break seed dormancy generally declined with soil depth. For Acacia, seed dormancy is broken by heat shock, a fire-cue that declines with soil depth. Some 250 species (approx 15% of the fire-prone flora) in the region are thought to have dormancy broken by heat shock. For Grevillea, where seed dormancy is broken by the interaction of smoke and heat shock, at two sites, we suggest three possibilities: (i) the smoke cue declined with soil depth; (ii) both heat and smoke are obligatory for breaking seed dormancy; or (iii) the cues may be independent and additive and below the zone of soil heating, only a proportion of available seeds had dormancy broken by smoke alone. At a third site (no residual seed bank detected) the smoke cue was predicted not to have declined with soil depth. Up to 900 species (just under half the fire-prone flora) in the study region are thought to have seed dormancy broken by the interaction of heat and smoke during the passage of a fire.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Common property has been theoretically linked to environmental degradation through the metaphor of tragedy of the which discounts local solutions to commons dilemmas and typically posits the need for strong states or privatization.

In most cases, germination-enhancing fungi have been isolated from roots of mature plants for conservation and cultivation purposes. To understand the germination biology of Dendrobium devonianum, an over-collected medicinal orchid, the seeds of D. devonianum were inoculated with a fungal strain (FDd1) isolated from naturally occurring protocorms of D. devonianum and two other germination-enhancing fungal strains (FDaI7 and FCb4) from D. aphyllum and Cymbidium mannii, respectively. The fungal strain was isolated from five protocorms of D. devonianum and identified as a species of the genus Epulorhiza. In germination trials, treatments with all of the three fungal strains showed a significant promoting effect on seed germination and protocorm formation, compared with the control treatment (no inoculation). However, FDd1 fungal strain showed the greatest effectiveness followed by FDaI7 and FCb4. For all inoculation and control treatments, seeds developed to protocorms regardless of the presence of illumination, whereas protocorms did not develop to seedlings unless illumination was provided. The results of our manipulative experiments confirmed the hypothesis that mycorrhizae associated with orchid seedlings are highly host-specific, and the degree of specificity may be life stagespecific under in vitro conditions. The specific mycorrhizal symbionts from protocorms can enhance restoration efforts and the conservation of orchids such as D. devonianum.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'There is a growing evidence that the climate change do has implications for drought vulnerable India with studies projecting future possible reductions in monsoon related rainfall in the country.

Ethnobotanical knowledge is a fundamental repository of the values and applications of different plants. This knowledge is often related to spiritual beliefs and religious sites, where plants have been nurtured and conserved for their use in rituals and traditional practices. While this link is well known for different areas of the global south, it has hardly been investigated in relatively more secular and modernized Western contexts. Here, we use vegetation surveys and published records to examine the occurrence of ethnobotanical values at 30 Catholic shrines in Central Italy, and compare them with an equal number of control sites. We ask this: to what extent is there an association of useful plants with sacred places in Italy, as found in other cultural contexts? We show that a greater number of useful plants are found at sacred sites. While this is mainly a consequence of the higher species richness of sacred sites, an association with plants used in animal husbandry is particularly evident, and likely related to the deep historical connection between sacred places and pastoralist traditions in Central Italy. Also, we show that there are significant variations in the distribution of old trees; the largest specimens are found at the center of sacred sites, while tree size visibly decreases away from the shrines. This indicates also that individual trees have been actively managed and conserved at sacred sites, probably driven by the symbolic values that old trees frequently embody.'\"], [\"Based on Allozyme, RAPD, and Microsatellite Markers'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The comparative assessment of genetic diversity using allozymes, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and microsatellite markers was conducted in endemic and endangered yellow catfish (Horabagrus brachysoma) sampled from three locations in Western Ghats river systems of India.

The response of species to patchiness may depend on the resolution and on the extent by which the spatial pattern is perceived. The goal of this paper is to identify the scale at which forest spatial pattern causes changes in species richness and abundances of Dipteran and Homopteran species as a whole, and further on their distinctive ecological functional groups. Using remotely-sensed optical imagery, we described the landscape structure surrounding sampling sites. We used two approaches to deal with the problem of the scale of observation: 1) variation of extent using a multiscale analysis, and 2) comparison of two satellite sensors with different spatial resolutions (SPOT: 20 20 m, and Landsat TM: 30 30 m). The relationship between entomological data and landscape descriptors at different spatial scales was tested with the Mantel test, redundancy analysis and stepwise multiple linear regression. Relative abundances of Homopteran species were affected by landscape patterns at finer scales than in Diptera. The strength of response to landscape was different for each Dipteran functional group. The multiscale analysis also enabled the optimal scale (6.25 ha) of landscape pattern, accounting for 62% of the variation in Homopteran richness, to be identified. As a practical application, Homopteran richness was mapped by extrapolation of the regression function to the pixels of the image.

In many countries, current water resources use already exceeds sustainable and renewable supply. Various methodologies are suggested to increase the sources of water supply, among which one of the alternatives is rainwater and runoff harvesting (ROH). Water scarcity and additional stress are among the most specific problems in arid and semi-arid regions, where vegetation cover is very weak under extensive solar irradiation effects with high evaporation rates. Present global warming, climate change impacts, and their future patterns are expected to cause increase in the evapotranspiration rates and hence reduction in the groundwater recharges. Under such circumstances, any simple but effective water storage augmentation facility as the artificial groundwater recharge gains vital importance for sustainability of water supply and survivals in desert ecosystems. Although intensive and frequent rainfall events are rare they generate significant surface water flow during occasional floods and especially flash floods with huge amounts of surface water. It is, therefore, necessary to enhance artificial groundwater recharge from consequent frequent runoffs through suitable hydraulic structures.

For this purpose, it presents ROH from the surface flows in depressions of Quaternary wadi deposits in arid and semi-arid regions.'\"], [\"Abstract: cashew plantations of south west Karnataka, India, foraging activity of 49 ants species belonging to 24 genera and 7 subfamilies were recorded. The study found that ants visited cashew trees regularly throughout the year. Myrmicinae ants were most dominant comprising 22 species followed by Formicinae with 13 species while, among Aenictinae and Dorylinae, only single species was found. Species richness was high in old cashew plantations recording of total species, while medium and young plantations recorded only 46.9 and Dominance of different ant species was noticed on cashew canopy, trunk and soil in different aged cashew plantations. Old cashew plantations were characterized by Oecophylla smaragdina, followed by Anoplolepis gracillipes, while, Camponotus compressus and C. sericeus were dominant in young and medium aged plantations. Pit fall trap collection consisted mostly of Odontomachus haematodus, Lophomyrmex quadrispinosus, Technomyrmex albipes, Myrmicaria brunnea, Diacamma sp., C. compressus and C. sericeus. During flowering and fruiting period of cashew, foraging of up to 10 ant species was seen on the same tree at a time. Activities of most ant species were predominant during winter and summer which coincides with flowering and fruiting period of cashew while during heavy down pour of south west monsoon, activities of only 10 species were seen. A significant positive correlation was found between number of ant species and maximum air temperature (0.842) and also with afternoon soil temperature (0.925).'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Two maps covering Bangalore and its environs published in 1945 mention a network of Karez in the northern parts of the present Bengaluru city.

De Wilde is an important medicinal plant from the Western Ghats of India, traditionally used in treatment of various gynecological disorders. Increasing commercial demand and decreasing numbers has resulted in this plant becoming endangered with crude drug materials being extensively substituted/adulterated with other plant species. The present study was undertaken with the objective of development and evaluation of multivariate cluster analysis of ISSR fingerprints against rbcL-based DNA barcodes as tool to understand the relationships and to differentiate common adulterants and substituents from S. asoca. ISSR-based Hierarchical Cluster Analysis was carried out on 41 samples of S. asoca and 5 each of the 5 common substituent/adulterant plants and the clustering patterns were evaluated against DNA-sequence-based barcoding of rbcL region of their plastids. Factorial analysis and Principal Coordinate Analysis revealed distinct groups of genetic pools of respective taxa thereby confirming the utility of ISSR fingerprinting as a useful tool for differentiation between the genuine and the adulterants/substituents. NCBI-BLAST search on DNA barcode rbcL region confirmed the results of ISSR assays. Therefore, our study demonstrated the utility of simple, cost-effective method of ISSR fingerprinting coupled with rbcL barcoding in differentiating this important medicinal plant from its common adulterants/substituents.'\"], ['Abstract: Abstract not available'], [\"Abstract: 'Landscape ecologists typically identify boundaries to demarcate habitatpatches. The boundary between two habitat types may be abrupt, such as thetransition between a grassland and a parking lot, or more gradual, such as theshift between successional forest stages. Two key aspects of landscapeboundaries, their shape and contrast, are predicted to influence movement ofmaterials, plants, and animals. Ecological theory suggests that a ratio should strongly influence animal emigration when patchboundaries are relatively permeable, but not when boundaries are more severe.Weinvestigated the interactive effects of patch shape and boundary contrast onmovement of ground-dwelling beetles (Carabidae and Tenebrionidae) in nativegrassland habitat at Jepson Prairie, Solano County, California, USA. Weconducted a field experiment with two patch shape treatments, square andrectangle, that held patch area constant, and two boundary contrast treatmentscreated by mowing grass surrounding each plot at two different heights. Wemonitored the number of beetles leaving each patch over a three-week periodfollowing treatment establishment. We observed a significant effect of boundarycontrast on net movement of beetles, with low contrast boundaries exhibitingnetimmigration and high contrast boundaries experiencing net emigration. Moreover,the importance of patch shape appeared to be greater for low contrast versushigh contrast boundaries, consistent with theoretical expectations. Ourcombinedobservations indicate that these ground-dwelling beetles were more likely tomove into patches that were rectangular and surrounded by a low contrast matrixthan patches that were square or surrounded by a high contrast matrix.

The forests are fragmented to different degrees due to expansion and intensification of human land use. However, the quantitative relationship between fragmentation and demography has not been established before for HKH along elevation gradient. We used the globally available tree canopy cover data derived from Landsat-TM satellite to find out the decadal forest cover change over 2000 to 2010 and their corresponding fragmentation levels. Using SRTM-derived DEM, we observed high forest cover loss up to 2400 m that highly corroborated with the population distribution pattern as derived from satellite observation. In general, forest cover loss was found to be higher in south-eastern part of HKH. Forest fragmentation obtained using mean radius of as indicator, was found to be very high up to 2400 m that also corroborated with high human population for the year 2000 and 2010. We observed logarithmic decrease in fragmentation change (area-weighted mean radius of gyration value), forest cover loss and population growth during 2000-2010 along the elevation gradient with very high R2 values (i.e., 0.889, 0.895, 0.944 respectively). Our finding on the pattern of forest fragmentation and human population across the elevation gradient in HKH region will have policy level implication for different nations and would help in characterizing hotspots of change.

Diversity in Bangladesh: Land Use and Artificial Selection. Bangladesh is often recognized as a secondary center of diversity for jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.) and is expected to harbor important genetic diversity of this underutilized tree crop. Unfortunately, genetic erosion is occurring before this rich local resource has been documented and utilized for potential crop improvement. The aim of this study was to carry out a village-based survey and make morphological measurements to document and assess jackfruit diversity across trees associated with a gradient of three locations/habitats (homesteads, public lands, and forest or fallow lands). We also tested the hypotheses that cultivated jackfruit found in homesteads exhibited positive selection pressure for characteristics desirable in the market, and that the tree location reflected its history of origin and human selection. This was accomplished using 28 standardized morphological descriptors and represents the first large-scale assessment (900 trees) of jackfruit diversity in multiple locations (nine villages). Among the descriptors studied, those most closely associated with jackfruit marketability showed a trend for selection among the trees located in homesteads. Both fruits and leaves were larger in plants on homesteads compared to plants in forest/fallow lands, and fruit quality was significantly higher in homestead trees compared to the other two location categories. However, 18.7% and 23.7% of the fruits found on public lands and forest/fallow lands, respectively, were still considered to be of excellent fruit quality and tree vigor was significantly higher in jackfruit in forest/fallow lands compared to the other location categories. The combination of high tree vigor and presence of excellent fruit quality among jackfruit in forest/fallow lands suggests that the Bangladeshi jackfruit germplasm, which is considered inferior for market and is being negatively impacted, has valuable genetic diversity to contribute to jackfruit cultivation. Furthermore, sampling across a gradient of habitats may enable the detection of possible trends resulting from domestication pressures.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Dendrocalamus hamiltonii is a commercially important bamboo species of India, experiencing population depletion due to heavy extraction from natural forests. Nuclear simple sequence repeats (nSSRs) were used to study the genetic diversity and population genetic structure of 19 natural stands of D. hamiltonii distributed across the northeast Himalayas. A total of 68 nSSR primer pairs of D. latiflorus and Bambusa arundinacea have been tested in D. hamiltonii for their transferability, out of which 17 primers showing positive and polymorphic amplification were used for genotyping. A total of 130 alleles were generated in 535 individuals of all the populations using selected primer pairs. The marker analysis indicated that D. hamiltonii populations have maintained a low level of genetic diversity in northeastern region of India. Despite a large proportion of the genetic variation (83.47%) confined within the populations, a moderate level of genetic differentiation was observed among the populations. The clustering pattern obtained in UPGMA and STRUCTURE analysis revealed that most of the populations were clustered in accordance with their geographical distribution. Two populations (DH03 and DH13) exhibiting significant genetic admixture were identified and recommended for in situ conservation. In addition, six highly diverse populations were also suggested for conservation in different geographical area under study. The study has revealed useful nSSR markers for D. hamiltonii, which were lacking earlier and the information generated herein is of paramount importance in devising programs for species conservation and genetic improvement.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Soil erosion is one of the serious issues threatening the environment. This degrading phenomenon deteriorates the soil fertility and drastically affects the agricultural practices. As a consequence, the productivity of soil is affected unquestionably. In this regard, there is a need to take up conservation and management measures which can be applied to check further soil erosion. Even though, soil erosion is a mass process spread across the watershed, it is not economically viable to implement conservation techniques to the entire watershed. However, a method is a pre-requisite to identify the most vulnerable areas and quantify the soil erosion. In this context, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) has been adopted to estimate soil erosion in the semi-arid Andipatti Watershed of Tamil Nadu, India. This model takes into consideration the parameters including runoff-rainfall erosivity factor (R), soil erodability Factor (K), topographic factor (LS), cropping management factor (C), and support practice factor (P). All these layers are prepared in a geographical information system (GIS) platform using various data sources and data preparation methods. The results of the study indicate that the annual average soil loss within the watershed is about (metric ton per hectare per year). Higher soil erosion is observed in the landuse classes of gullied wasteland, open scrub forest and degraded plantation. The soil erosion risk is extremely higher on the steep slopes and adjoining foot hills. Based on the average soil erosion values of different landuse classes and characteristics of land, a proposed landuse map was prepared. The estimated soil erosion and the proposed landuse map could be an effective input for drawing sustainable watershed development measures.'\"], [\"Abstract: ' Shade coffee agroforestry systems have the potential to support biodiversity. Sustainable certification of coffee has been promoted as a means to provide incentives to maintain these systems, but as yet there is little evidence if this is effective. We analyzed tree diversity on smallholder organic and conventional farms in buffer zones of three conservation areas in Costa Rica, Guatemala and Nicaragua (the later included some large-scale conventional and Rainforest Alliance certified farms). Organic farms had greater farm level tree species richness and Shannon diversity compared to conventional farms; estimated native tree species richness across the landscape was probably greater on organic farms than conventional in Nicaragua (48 vs. 28 species respectively) and possibly in Guatemala (23 vs. 15 species respectively). Organic farms had higher shade levels and more tree strata than conventional farms. In Guatemala and Nicaragua tree species composition was not closely related to whether farms were organic or conventional, although within composition clusters, organic farms tended to have greater diversity. In contrast, organic and conventional farms in Costa Rica mostly belonged to different tree species clusters. In Nicaragua most large-scale farms, and all Rainforest certified farms, formed a distinct species composition cluster with presence of old-growth forest species and within which Rainforest farms had greater diversity. Tree species composition of the shade seems to be mainly due to management history; but certification effectively differentiates those farms with greater tree diversity. Longer-term monitoring is required to determine whether certification can be an incentive to conserve or expand biodiverse coffee agroforestry systems within the buffer zones around conservation areas.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Changes in species composition and density of trees >10 cm gbh in a tropical dry evergreen forest in Puthupet, south India are interpreted for the period between 1992 and 2002.

Tree species richness increased by 21% (from 24 to 29 species) by an addition of eight species and local extinction of three species. The tree density increased just by eight individuals (from 1330 stems in 1992 to 1338 in 2002), but the basal area decreased by 8% (from 37.5 to 34.5 m2 Many species (11 numbers) have increased in abundance rather than decreased. Many surviving species seem to have considerable stability in abundance at the local scale. The density of smaller stems (10 29 cm gbh) increased by 15.3%, while that of the larger trees decreased drastically (81.6%). Ninety percent of the missing stems were from the middlestorey of the forest. Tree density changes among the three ecological guilds revealed a decrease in stem density and an increase in basal area in the lowerstorey; while the middlestorey exhibited a reverse trend. Family-wise, tree density changes revealed that the majority of families (67%) showed an increase in stem density.

The majority of studies addressing this issue have been conducted on a regional or national basis, precluding a broad picture of patterns of representation at the species level. We present a global assessment of the representation of the terrestrial geographic ranges of complete taxonomic groups: all known extant amphibians, birds and mammals (20,736 species) within the current global system of protected areas. We conclude that it is necessary substantially to improve the levels of coverage of the geographic ranges of the majority of species, even the widespread ones. This is particularly true for rare species, which might be assumed to be foci for protected area systems. To improve on the low levels of coverage of vertebrate ranges attained by the existing areas, key regions should be targeted, but heavy reliance will also have to be placed on approaches to sustaining populations in the wider, unprotected landscape.'\"], ['Abstract: Abstract not available'], [\"Abstract: 'Indian village ecosystems are diverse with respect to population pressures, agricultural activities and production, livestock composition, energy sources, economics and infrastructural capabilities.

To investigate the prospect of groundwater, hydrogeomorphological features of river basin viz. Mulki-Pavanje were identified and mapped. To evaluate the characteristics of the basin, different morphometric parameters (linear, areal and relief) were computed in sub-basin wise (SB-I to -VII). The linear parameters suggest drainage network is controlled by geomorphology. The form factor (F f), elongation ratio (R e) and circularity ratio (R c) suggest that the basin is in an elongated shape. The drainage density (D d) indicates resistant/permeable strata under medium-dense vegetation with moderate relief. The areal parameters of the sub-basins (except SBI and III) indicates moderate ground-slopes associated with moderately permeable rocks, which promote moderate run-off and infiltration. Drainage texture (T) of the whole basin indicates coarse texture while the SB-I, and III showing an intermediate texture. The relief parameters namely ruggedness number (R  n ) infers low basin relief and poor drainage density. To identify the most deficit/surplus zones of groundwater suitable weightages were assigned to the hydrogeomorphological units and morphometric parameters. The study reveal that the basin manifest that SB-III shall be most deficit zone of groundwater, whereas SB-VII, VI and V are found to show increase in groundwater potentiality.

Typical explanations for this change use models of population pressure; increasing herds and decreasing pasture are held to blame. This explanation, however intuitive, is unsatisfactory. Instead, changing institutional and economic patterns are creating new contexts for strategic movement. Bottlenecks in the yearly resource calendar, caused by the disintegration of obligatory social relationships, force migrations during periods of scarcity. Changes in the volume and pattern of the meat and wool markets have also created opportunities for migrating pastoralists. Producers increase their access to markets and the reproductive rate of their herd through long, annual, migration. While nomadism is a general adaptation to changes in the socioeconomic conditions of the region, differential resource endowments account for the range of strategies; wealthy herders have opportunities not enjoyed by more marginal producers.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'NORMAN MYERS: An honorary visiting fellow at Green College.

This community was then compared to other adjacent wetlands (Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Laizhouwan, Jiaozhouwan, and Yellow River Delta wetland) located near the Huanghai and Bohai Seas using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Results showed a total of 56 higher plant species belonging to 52 genera from 20 families in Chenier wetland, the majority of which were dicotyledons. Single-species families were predominant, while larger families, including Gramineae, Compositae, Leguminosae, and Chenopodiaceae contained a higher number of species species). Cosmopolitan species were also dominant with apparent intrazonality. Abundance (number of species) of temperate species was twice that of tropical taxa. Species number of perennial herbs, such as Gramineae and Compositae, was generally higher. Plant diversity in the Chenier wetland, based on the Shannon-Wiener index, was observed to be between the Qinhuangdao and Laizhouwan indices, while no significant difference was found in other wetlands using the Simpson index. Despite these slight differences in diversity, PCoA based on species abundance and composition of the wetland flora suggest that the Bohai Chenier community was highly similar to the coastal wetlands in Tianjin and Laizhouwan, further suggesting that these two wetlands could be important breeding grounds and resources for the restoration of the plant ecosystem in the Chenier wetland.'\"], ['Abstract: Abstract not available'], [\"Abstract: ''\"], [\"plant'\"], [\"Abstract: ' Saraca asoca (Roxb.) Willd, commonly known as or is one of the most important medicinal plants used in raw herbal trade in India. The bark extracts of the tree are used in the treatment of leucorrhea and other uterine disorders besides also having anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-pyretic, anti-helminthic, and analgesic activity. The indiscriminate and rampant extraction of the wood to meet the ever-increasing market demand has led to a sharp decline in naturally occurring populations of the species in the country. Consequently, the species has recently been classified as by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Increasing deforestation and increasing demand for this medicinal plant have resulted in a limited supply and suspected widespread adulteration of the species in the raw herbal trade market. Adulteration is a serious concern due to: (i) reduction in the efficacy of this traditional medicine, (ii) considerable health risk to consumers, and (iii) fraudulent product substitution that impacts the economy for the Natural Health Product (NHP) Industry and consumers. In this paper, we provide the first attempt to assess the extent of adulteration in the raw herbal trade of S. asoca using DNA barcoding validated by NMR spectroscopic techniques. Analyzing market samples drawn from 25 shops, mostly from peninsular India, we show that more than of the samples were spurious, representing plant material from at least 7 different families. This is the first comprehensive and large-scale study to demonstrate the widespread adulteration of market samples of S. asoca in India. These results pose grave implications for the use of raw herbal drugs, such as that of S. asoca, on consumer health and safety. Based on these findings, we argue for a strong and robust regulatory framework to be put in place, which would ensure the quality of raw herbal trade products and reassure consumer confidence in indigenous medicinal systems.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Soil erosion and water conservation are major concerns arising from agricultural acceleration, changing land patterns and uncertain rainfall pattern.

The modelling results predicted widespread deforestation in Northeast India and in Andaman & Nicobar Islands and hence is likely to affect the remaining forests significantly before 2025. The multi-layer perceptron neural network has predicted the forest cover for the period of 1880 and 2025 with a Kappa statistic of >0.70. The model predicted a further decrease of 2305 km2 of forest area in the Northeast and Andaman & Nicobar Islands by 2025. The majority of the protected areas are successful in the protection of the forest cover in the Northeast due to management practices, with the exception of Manas, Sonai-Rupai, Nameri and Marat Longri.

However universally acknowledged, this reality is not appreciated as much as one might imagine or hope. Having achieved a high standing in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 1992, biodiversity appears to have gradually fallen from that position in the 20 years since. This is evidenced by the fact that most discussions and actions in relation to the CBD have now shifted to sustainable development and ecosystem services (Daily 1997), instead of focusing more directly on biodiversity values themselves. One reason for this fall in status seems to be linked to issues about the actual definition of whether used in a broad sense, including the diversity of genes, species, communities and ecosystems, or more narrowly defined as the diversity of species alone.

The nature and scope of its application has varied widely according to the context and sector within which it has been applied. The central issue which this article seeks to address is the regulatory and the policy making space that is available to the Government of India in the context of the obligations as undertaken under the Cartagena Protocol and under various other international treaties. The regulatory space would also be affected by the domestic legal developments across sectors in which the principle has been applied. recent decision on the large-scale commercialisation of Bt-Cotton has already created much debate regarding its appropriateness given the realities of Indian farm practices.

Our results reveal the presence of two distinct acoustic lineages (80 and phonic types). Forearm length also differs significantly between the two phonic types. They share a sister taxa relationship and the average genetic distance between them is over 8 %. Phylogenetic reconstruction and the associated divergence time suggest an evolutionary history that correlates with a middle Miocene separation. We propose that these two phonic types be called sibling species and evolutionarily significant units (ESU) within the subgenus Indorhinolophus. We recommend a new name, R. indorouxii for the species representing the phonic type.

Geophysical electrical surveys with four electrodes configuration, i.e., Wenner and Schlumberger method, were carried out at the same selected sites to observe the similarity and compared both the applications in terms of its use and handling in the field. A total 54 VES soundings were carried out spread over the Dhule district and representing different lithological units. The VES curves are drawn using inverse slope method for Wenner configuration, IPI2 win Software, and curve matching techniques were used for Schlumberger configuration. Regionwise lithologs are prepared based on the obtained resistivity and thickness for Wenner method. Regionwise curves were prepared based on resistivity layers for Schlumberger method. Comparing the two methods, it is observed that Wenner and Schlumberger methods have merits or demerits. Considering merits and demerits from the field point of view, it is suggested that Wenner inverse slope method is more handy for calculation and interpretation, but requires lateral length which is a constrain. Similarly, Schlumberger method is easy in application but unwieldy for their interpretation.

In all the four tree species, biomass of both fine- and coarse-roots followed a unimodal growth curve by showing a gradual increase from spring (pre-rainy) season to autumn (post rainy) season. Biomass to necromass ratio varied between 2 to 3 in the four tree species. The maximum (3.2) ratio was observed during spring and the minimum (2) in the rainy season.

Whereas self-help groups (Kudumbasree) in Kerala have enhanced their position, farming groups (JLGs), by contrast, have brought little betterment. In some cases they have even downsized management and knowledge of resources related to agriculture and do not integrate or enhance Kurichya knowledge. As some women are now introducing high-yielding rice seeds and fertilizer and as it is impossible for them to control land and get access to traditional rice domain of contest the notion of women being considered the preservers of agrobiodiversity. We argue, rather, that the construction and transformation of ecological traditional knowledge is highly dependent on the gendered multi-scaled power structures of state and community.'\"], [\"Abstract: ' The occurrence of high concentrations of fluoride in groundwater in the villages of Singhpur and Sagaragan in the Nayagarh District of Orissa and its relation with the fluoride-rich hot spring water located nearby have been studied. The composition of the hot spring water is very comparable to the other thermal waters of the world. Thermodynamic considerations show that more than 65% of the groundwater and hot spring water samples are oversaturated with calcite, and only four samples are oversaturated with fluorite. Fluoride concentration shows a positive relation to sodium, bicarbonate and pH, and a negative relation to calcium and magnesium in fluoride-rich groundwater and hot spring water. Principal component analysis shows that the fluoride-rich groundwater was produced due to a mixing of hot spring water with the surrounding groundwater. Studies of the saturation index of fluorite with log  electrical conductivity also indicate mixing of hot spring water with the surrounding groundwater. The spatial distribution of fluoride in groundwater follows the topography of the area.'\"], ['Abstract: Abstract not available'], [\"Abstract: 'Arrested prograde charnockite formation in quartzofeldspathic gneisses is widespread in the high-grade terrains of southern India and Sri Lanka. Two major kinds of orthopyroxene-producing reactions are recognized. Breakdown of calcic amphibole by reaction with biotite and quartz in tonalitic/granitic produced the regional orthopyroxene isograd, manifest in charnockitic mottling and veining of exposures, as at Kabbal, Karnataka, and in the Kurunegala District of the Sri Lanka Central Highlands. Chemical and modal analyses of carefully chosen immediately-adjacent amphibole gneiss and charnockite pairs show that the orthopyroxene is produced by an open system reaction involving slight losses of CaO, MgO and FeO and gains of SiO2 and Na2O. Rb and Y are depleted in the charnockite. Another kind of charnockitization is found in paragneisses throughout the southern high-grade area, and involves the reaction of biotite and to produce orthopyroxene and K-feldspar. Although charnockite formation along shears and other deformation zones at such localities as Ponmudi, Kerala is highly reminiscent of Kabbal, close pair analyses are not as suggestive of open-system behavior. This type of charnockite formation is found in granulite facies areas where no prograde amphibole-bearing gneisses exist and connotes a higher-grade reaction than that of the orthopyroxene isograd. Metamorphic conditions of both Kabbaltype and Ponmudi-type localities were C and kbar.

The modelling group at GISS has developed new and more physically appropriate parameterizations of meteorological/hydrological processes which are being validated in an effort to improve the performance of the Model II version of the GISS GCM. This study discusses some preliminary evaluations of this testing based on multiple-year simulations at latitude by longitude horizontal resolution. These runs individually incorporate new formulations of the planetary boundary layer (PBL), the moist cumulus convection scheme and the ground hydrology and compare results using B-grid and C-grid numerics. The new PBL produces a realistically stronger tropical surface circulation, while the new cumulus scheme generates more realistic distributions of tropical convection and moisture. The main impact of the more sophisticated ground hydrology model is to increase surface air temperatures. Improvements in modelled sea level pressure and rainfall features by the C-grid are somewhat offset by increases in speed excesses at the cores of the summer hemisphere westerly jets. Each modelling innovation targeted a different aspect of the climate not adequately represented by Model II. However, since the various modelling changes were tested individually, the present evaluation could not demonstrate many dramatic improvements in the simulated climates. This documentation of impacts should, however, serve as a benchmark for the validation of future simulations of the GISS GCM that combine all of the modelling improvements.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Within the framework of IWRM, a major concern in the humid tropics is the effects of on the storm rainfall-runoff hydrology of both forests and converted forest lands.

How much these man-induced impacts have been influential on climate relations, as against the effects of inherent climate variability and predicted climate change scenarios, still remains a major challenge to quantify.

However, few attempts have been made to look for general patterns in primate responses to habitat loss and fragmentation, or whether these may be associated with traits. We conducted a review of published literature on effects of patch size to quantify the effect of a reduction in this predictor on primates, and to determine whether these effects depend on traits. The effects of patch size on seven response variables (density, parasite prevalence and diversity, presence, genetic diversity, time spent feeding, resting and movement), were extracted from 135 papers and compared across six species traits (diet specialisation, social structure, body size, home range size, group size and dispersal ability). We found that density, parasitic prevalence and diversity and time spent feeding were positively associated with a reduction in patch size, while presence and genetic diversity were negatively associated. Time spent resting and moving did not show clear patterns. We found little evidence that the effect of patch size varies consistently with traits. This study provides important evidence for the consistent effect of patch size on a range of factors that influence the dynamics of primate populations. However, there is a need to move beyond quantifying patch size effects alone and to quantify the effects of changes occurring at broader landscape scales.

The present research work has utilized Remote Sensing and GIS techniques for assessing vulnerability of the Gujarat coast due to predicted sea level rise. Synergetic use of satellite remote sensing, numerical simulations and filed observations has been done to generate coastal thematic information followed by validation. Coastal vulnerability assessment of the entire Gujarat coast on 1:50,000 scale were carried out considering five physical parameters. They are; coastal geomorphology, coastal slope, shoreline change rate, mean spring tidal range, and significant wave height. The rank values of all the five physical variables are integrated through additive method to compute a Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) where the relative ranking is assigned to various coastal segments based on the vulnerability level. The CVI values categorize Gujarat coast into four risk level classes. The results show that of the Gujarat coast is under high to very high risk category and of the Gujarat coast is under Moderate to Low risk category due to an anticipated rise in sea level. The coastal regions under very high risk category are along northwestern parts of the Gulf of Khambhat, the northernmost parts of the Gulf of Kachchh and western parts of the Kachchh coast. The southern parts of the Saurashtra coast and southwestern parts of the Kachchh coast is under the low risk category along with isolated segments along the eastern parts of the Gulf of Khambhat. The approach developed for assessing vulnerability of the coast to predicted sea level rise using remote sensing and GIS techniques can be used effectively by coastal management authorities and decision makers to devise better coastal zone management plans as well as to ensure efficient mitigation measures to minimize the losses due to possible impact of predicted sea level rise through which appropriate measures to protect life, property and environment can be timely planned.'\"], [\"Abstract: ' Sesuvium portulacastrum L.

Significant differences were observed for morphological traits viz., length, width, diameter and area of leaf, internodal distance and stem diameter for different clones when compared with the clone from Gujarat state (GJ1). A UPGMA dendrogram for morphological traits based on the similarity coefficient clustered the clones into three groups considering 80% polymorphism as criteria. Molecular diversity among the clones was studied using Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and markers specific to Ac homologous region. Of the total 749 RAPD loci amplified with 70 random primers, 294 were polymorphic with 39.25% diversity. A phylogenetic tree constructed with UPGMA and SHAN, grouped the clones into three major clades based on RAPD data. The molecular diversity studied with ITS and markers specific to Ac homologous region revealed 37.50% and 66.66% polymorphism and clustered the clones into three and four clades, respectively. The genetic diversity analysis revealed wide variations among the S. portulacastrum clones, reflecting a high level of diversity within the species which might be due to anthropogenic impact and geographic environmental conditions. Further, the various clones from the different eco-geographic coastal localities might have originated from native places of wild abundance.

Towards this it is essential to understand the climate change perceptions, adaptation practices and barriers to effective adaptation at household and community level. This paper using household surveys and focus group discussions in one of the drought prone areas of Odisha in India, explores various aspects of perception on climate change and barriers to adaptation. It also analyses the accuracy of perceptions based on rainfall data from nearest meteorological stations. The study reinforces the argument by earlier studies that the perception by people simply cannot be wrong because they may have a just a low correlation with underlying meteorological data. Results suggest that farmers increasingly perceive the changes in the rainfall and temperature patterns. However, when compared with the trend in actual rainfall data, perceptions on rainfall are found to more closely align with the results from the nearest station as compared to the station farther from it. Analysis revealed that seasonal rainfall variability has a profound influence on the perceptions on climate change and drought in the study region. are still dependent on the traditional forecasting system because of the lack of access to modern climate forecasting and tailored information for agricultural practice. Although farmers in the study region are already adapting to the changing climate, the study finds that while lack of access to water and irrigation, information on climate change adaptation and early warning systems are major barriers to adaptation at the household level lack of government intervention, lack of knowledge on drought resistant crops and varieties and lack of renovation of water bodies and irrigation were mentioned as the major barriers at the community level.

While the influence of dispersal has been studied quite extensively, the effect of speciation has not received much attention, even though it was already claimed at an early stage of neutral theory development that the mode of speciation would leave a signature on metacommunity structure. Here, we derive analytical expressions for the distribution of abundances according to the neutral model with recruitment (i.e., dispersal and establishment) limitation and random fission speciation which seems to be a more realistic description of (allopatric) speciation than the point mutation mode of speciation mostly used in neutral models. We find that the two modes of speciation behave qualitatively differently except when recruitment is strongly limited. Fitting the model to six large tropical tree data sets, we show that it performs worse than the original neutral model with point mutation speciation but yields more realistic predictions for speciation rates, species longevities, and rare species. Interestingly, we find that the metacommunity abundance distribution under random fission is identical to the broken-stick abundance distribution and thus provides a dynamical explanation for this grand old lady of abundance distributions.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'A study was carried out to investigate the population structure and tree species diversity in two different forest types of Nagaland.

Estimates of annual carbon uptake increment suggest that our forests and plantations have been able to remove at least 0.125 Gt of CO2 from the atmosphere in the year 1995.

The aim of this study is to identify different types of forest patches, and their condition under present land-use intensification, and discuss prospects for their integration into sustainable local farming systems. Five types of forest patches are distinguished, both natural and planted ones, including rows of trees, woody patches, gallery forests, hill-slope forests and homegarden conglomerations. Natural woody patches and gallery forests in Imperata grassland are subject to degradation and land-use conversion under conditions of agricultural intensification. Woody patches in grassland affected by frequent burning and grazing cover small areas (66% below 50 m2 as opposed to 28% in protected grassland) and contain relatively few woody plant species (25 woody species in total as opposed to 82 where protected). Yet where well managed, they may provide a variety of products for sale and subsistence, covering emergency needs and giving off-season cash income to rural communities. Moreover they serve like the gallery forest various ecological functions, carrying valuable indigenous tree species, retaining soil base nutrients, providing a continuous supply of organic matter and intercepting fine earth soil particles removed from bare surfaces.

The distributions of small mammals in Swaziland were surveyed at 39 localities. A total of 15 species of rodents and ten species of insectivores were captured during the survey. The number of species of insectivore captured at a locality was positively correlated with mean annual rainfall, while the number of rodent species captured was negatively correlated with altitude. The number of rodent species captured was lower on Swazi Nation Land compared with privately owned land or protected land (reserves). This was probably due to the radical habitat alteration that had taken place on Swazi Nation Land, inter alia overgrazing by livestock, cultivation of maize and deforestation. The effect of this habitat alteration on the number of rodent species was more pronounced in high-lying areas of Swaziland. This may have been due to the fact that a large number of the rodent species inhabiting high-lying areas require thick, tall grassland habitats, whereas many of the low-lying species prefer more open habitats with less grass cover. Since grazing acts to reduce grass cover, it is suggested that the species inhabiting high-lying areas would be more affected by overgrazing, than low-lying species.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'This paper presents a rain duration-dependent procedure based on the popular Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) methodology for computation of direct surface runoff from long duration rains.

Furthermore, four species of plesiomorphous and related sea cucumbers (Holothurian scabra, Holothuria leucospilota, Stichopus horrens and Apostichopus japonicas) were tested for mutual cross-amplification using a total of ninety microsatellite loci. Although transferability and universality of all loci were generally low, the results of the cross-species study showed that the markers can be applied to identify individuals to species according to the presence or absence of specific microsatellite alleles. The microsatellite markers reported here will contribute to the study of genetic diversity, assisted breeding, and population conservation in sea cucumbers, as well as allow for the identification of individuals to closely related species.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Macrofungi play an extraordinarily important role in the catalysis of the nutrient cycle of deciduous and coniferous forests. Habitat degradation adversely influences the number of fruiting bodies of macrofungi and diminishes the diversity of the fungal community. The diversity of the terricolous- and lignicolous macrofungi assemblages were compared in stands of semi-natural and two plant associations modified by humans in different degrees in North-East Hungary. We used data from 15 permanent plots that were sampled for vascular plants and macrofungi. Rank-abundance curves and diversity profiles were applied for diversity research. The results indicated that structure and diversity of the terricolous macrofungi assemblages were mainly influenced by climatic and habitat conditions and the degradation of the plant associations to a lesser degree. The diversity of lignicolous macrofungi was primarily affected by the continuous presence, quality, and quantity of deadwood. Accordingly, the form and degree of forest management, as well as the age of the growing stocks, influenced community structure. If nature conservation planning and conservation activity are based on those biodiversity indicators which are good proxies for macrofungi biodiversity, the latter might be optimal for preserving macrofungi biodiversity.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'While deliberations relating to negative consequences of large dams on the environment continue to dominate world attention, positive benefits provided by small dams, also known as check dams, go unobserved. Besides, little is known about the potential of check dams in mitigating global warming impacts due to less data availability. Small dams are usually commissioned to private contractors who do not have clear mandate from their employers to post their work online for public scrutiny. As a result, statistics on the design, cost, and materials used to build check dams are not available in public domain. However, this review paper presents data for the first time on the often ignored potential of check dams mitigating climate-induced hydrological threats.

Three diploid Oryza species with CC genome are found in Africa and Asia to Papua New Guinea. In southern South Asia these three CC genome diploid species can be found, O. eichingeri and O. rhizomatis in Sri Lanka and O. officinalis in India. AA genome wild relatives of rice are also found in the same geographic region. Germplasm of both diploid CC and AA genome Oryza germplasm has recently been collected from Sri Lanka. AFLP analysis was used to compare the genetic diversity of the two Oryza genomes from a similar geographic region in southern South Asia. In addition, the diploid CC Oryza germplasm was also analyzed by RAPD and SSR methodologies and the combined results were analyzed. The results show that in southern South Asia the diploid CC genome species have a high level of genetic diversity compared to the diploid AA genome species. Molecular marker analysis revealed that populations of O. rhizomatis from northern and southeastern Sri Lanka are genetically differentiated. One accession of O. rhizomatis was aligned with O. eichingeri. This accession was collected from the site of O. rhizomatis that is the closest to a population of O. eichingeri. O. eichingeri showed lower genetic diversity than the other two diploid Oryza CC genome species.

Eig were evaluated at adult plant stage. Two hundred and thirty nine accessions of Ae. tauschii, 30 of Ae. cylindrica, 16 of Ae. ventricosa, 3 of Ae. crassa Boiss. and 5 of Ae. juvenalis were resistant to stem rust pathotypes prevalent in South India at Wellington under field condition. Invariably, all the accessions of the five species were resistant to leaf rust pathotypes. Quantitative measurement of disease using area under the disease progress curve revealed the slow progress of disease in the resistant accessions compared to susceptible check (Agra Local). Since all the five species have D genome, it could be concluded that the genes present in D genome might play a vital role in leaf rust resistance, but in case of stem rust resistance wide range of differential response was noticed. Among the species evaluated, Ae. tauschii was exploited to a larger extent, followed by Ae. ventricosa and Ae. cylindrica for leaf and stem rust resistance because of the homology of D genome with hexaploid bread wheat. While, Ae. crassa and Ae. juvenalis could not be utilized so far, possibly due to partial homology which makes the transfer of traits difficult.

However this knowledge has not been transferred to modern society. We suggest this may be due to the asymmetry between scientific and TK, which demands a new approach that considers the assemblage of TK and scientific knowledge. A greater understanding of TK is beginning to emerge based on our research with both the Irulas and Malasars; they believe that a healthy lifestyle is founded on a healthy environment.

For isolation of SSR primers, our earlier attempts with enrichment strategies like affinity did not extract a single SSR primer due to close proximity of restriction sites to the SSR motif. Hence we developed a Reverse Genome Walking strategy with better enrichment efficiency of 72% that generated seven new SSR primers. Genotyping precisely discriminated majority of genotypes which indicated that the SSR primers are very informative. A total of 62 alleles with an average of 15.5 alleles over 4 loci were identified. All the SSR primers showed an average Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) value of 0.85. The estimated average Shared Allele Frequency ranged between 1.57 and 20.12%.

The MV index provides new insights into the intraseasonal and interannual variabilities of the broad-scale tropical Asian summer monsoon (TASM), including the South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) and the South China Sea summer monsoon (SCSSM). On the intraseasonal timescale, the pentad-to-pentad MV index bears a close relationship to the broad-scale rainfall in the TASM regions. Among 29 summers from 1979 to 2007, in 23/27 summers the correlation coefficients are higher than 0.7 in the SASM/SCSSM region. However, in fewer than 9 summers, the correlations between the broad-scale rainfall and the existing circulation indices are higher than 0.7. On the interannual timescale, various existing SASM circulation indices are moderately or well correlated with all-India summer monsoon rainfall, whereas their correlations with broad-scale SASM rainfall are weak. In contrast, the summer mean MV index correlates well with the broad-scale SASM rainfall and all-India summer monsoon rainfall (correlation of 0.73 and 0.65, respectively). In the SCSSM region, the summer mean MV index also bears a close relationship to the SCSSM rainfall, although some discrepancies exist during certain years. The composite strong TASM shows a stronger low-tropospheric low pressure in association with the enhanced westerly winds and moisture transfer, stronger convection, and upper-tropospheric easterly winds, which indicate that the MV index can well capture the features of TASM.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'In an age of Anthropocene, the urban landscapes are recognised as the of human-mediated alien species introductions. As the cities provide an ideal natural experimental system to investigate the patterns of alien plant diversity in urban landscapes, the present study aimed to unravel the taxonomic, biogeographic and ecological patterns of alien flora of of the largest urban centres in the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. The alien flora of Srinagar comprises 325 species, constituting ca.35% of total flora of the city. Out of the 325 alien species documented, 157 species (43%) were recorded to be under cultivation, while 168 species (57%) were growing in the wild (i.e., outside cultivation); those growing in the wild, in turn, comprised 110 cultivation escapes and 58 accidentally introduced plant species. Biogeographically, two-third of the alien plant diversity reported from Srinagar is native to Asia-Temperate. This indicates that climatic similarity between Asia-Temperate and Kashmir Himalayas facilitate in flourishing similar floristic diversity. The study highlights a relatively higher proportion of herbaceous growth form in the aliens growing in the wild (80%) than those under cultivation (43%). Similarly, 82% of the alien species under cultivation had a perennial life span, but those growing in the wild were dominated by annuals (44%). Currently, 45 species are growing as casuals and 124 species are naturalised (including 105 naturalised non-invasive and 19 naturalised invasive). Along the continuum of casual-naturalised-invasive categories, the contribution of cultivation escapes and accidently introduced aliens contrastingly shows decreasing and increasing trends respectively. Interestingly, the results revealed that the human practice of stopping cultivation of alien escapes increased rapidly as we move along the continuum.

Each of these impacts differs across varying scales of analysis. This paper illustrates how forest, climate change and hydrology debates play out in the context of the forest plantations of Australian black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) in the upper Palni hills of southern India. We outline the contradictory perspectives of different local groups regarding the impact of plantations on catchment hydrology and water availability, and examine these in relation to changes in the regional economy and rainfall patterns. Our analysis indicates that changes in these two factors have played a more significant role than existing wattle plantations in affecting local and regional water availability. We suggest that ongoing debates regarding forest change relationships need to broaden their scope to include changes in regional rainfall patterns and shifts in regional economic activity. This approach is likely to provide a more realistic assessment of plantation forests in a dynamic regional context, and offer more resilient strategies for regional landscape and catchment management under conditions of high variability in rainfall patterns.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Garcinia gummi-gutta, popularly known as Malabar tamarind or kodampuli is fruit tree species of high potential.

Gaps play an important role in forest ecology helping to preserve bio- and pedo-diversity, influencing nutrient cycles, and maintaining the complex structure of the late-successional forests. Over the last 30 years, numerous reviews have been written describing gap dynamics. Here we synthesize current understanding on gap dynamics relating to tree regeneration with particular emphasis on gap characteristics considered critical to develop ecologically sustainable forest management systems and to conserve native biodiversity. Specifically, we addressed the question: how do gaps influence forest structure? From the literature reviewed, the size of gaps induces important changes in factors such as light intensity, soil humidity and soil biological properties that influence tree species regeneration and differ in gaps of different sizes. Shadetolerant species can colonize small gaps; shade-intolerant species need large gaps for successful regeneration. Additionally, gap dynamics differ between temperate, boreal, and tropical forests, showing the importance of climate differences in driving forest regeneration.

The present study investigates the vulnerability of the coastal aquifers using Geographic Information System (GIS)-based DRASTIC model. The seven DRASTIC parameters have been analyzed using the statistical equation of this model to demarcate the vulnerable zones for aquifer contamination. The vulnerability index map is prepared from the weighted spatial parameters, and an accounting of total index value ranged from 85 to 213. Based on the categorization of vulnerability classes, the high vulnerable zones are found near the beach placer mining areas between Manavalakurichi and Kodimanal coastal stretches. The aquifers associated with settlements and agricultural lands in the part have experienced high vulnerability due to contaminated water bodies. Similarly, the coastal areas of Thengapattinam and Manakudi estuary and around the South Tamaraikulam have also been falling under high vulnerability condition due to backwater and saltpan. In general, the nearshore region except the placer mining zone and the backwater has a moderately vulnerable condition, and the vulnerability index values range from 149 to180. Significantly, the northern and northeastern uplands and some parts of deposition zones in the coast have been identified as low to no vulnerable conditions. They are structurally controlled by various geological features such as charnockite, garnet biotite gneiss and granites, and sand dunes, respectively. The aquifer vulnerability assessment has been cross-verified by geochemical indicators such as total dissolved solids (TDS), HCO3 and ratio. The high ranges of TDS and values are well correlated with the observed high vulnerable zones in the study area. The ratio (7.13 to 12.18) of the high vulnerable zone obviously indicates deterioration of the aquifer contamination. Sensitivity analysis has also been performed to evaluate sensitivity of the individual DRASTIC parameters to aquifer vulnerability. This reveals the net recharge rate and groundwater table depth are becoming more sensitive to aquifer contamination. It is realized that the GIS is an effective platform for aquifer vulnerability mapping with reliable accuracy, and hence, the study is more useful for sustainable water resource management and the aquifer conservation.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Pradillo M , Santos JL (2011) The template choice decision in meiosis: is the sister important?Chromosoma120\"], [\"Abstract: 'Shrubs belonging to Carissa genus (Apocyanaceae family) are potential sources of food, medicine and fuel, yet they are wallowing under obscurity and rarely been exploited.

The average soil carbon stock in the agricultural soils was 2.03 kg The carbon stocks showed a significant decreasing trend with the altitudinal gradient with maximum values of 4.13 kg at m a.s.l. and minimum value of 1.55 kg at m a.s.l. The agricultural soil showed the least carbon content values indicating negative impacts of soil plowing, overgrazing, and soil degradation. Lower carbon values at higher altitudes attest to the immature character of forest stands, as well as to degradation due to immense fuel wood extraction, timber extraction, and harsh climatic conditions. The study indicates that immediate attention is required for the conservation of rapidly declining carbon stocks in agricultural soils, as well as in the soils of higher altitudes.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'This paper identifies newer areas of arsenic contamination in the District Kanker, which adjoins the District Rajnandgaon where high contamination has been reported earlier. A correlation with the mobile phase episodes of arsenic contamination has been identified, which further hinges on the complex geology of the area. Arsenic concentrations in both surface and groundwater, aquatic organisms (snail and water weeds) soil and vegetation of Kanker district and its adjoining area have been reported here. The region has been found to contain an elevated level of arsenic. All segments of the ecoysystem are contaminated with arsenic at varying degrees. The levels of arsenic vary constantly depending on the season and location. An analysis of groundwater from 89 locations in the Kanker district has shown high values of arsenic, iron and manganese (mean: 144, 914 and respectively). The surface water of the region shows elevated levels of arsenic, which is influenced by the geological mineralised zonation. The most prevalent species in the groundwater is As(III), whereas the surface water of the rivers shows a significant contamination with the As(V) species. The analysis shows a bio-concentration of the toxic metals arsenic, nickel, copper and chromium. Higher arsenic concentrations (groundwater concentrations greater than are associated with sedimentary deposits derived from volcanic rocks, hence mineral leaching appears to be the source of arsenic contamination. Higher levels of arsenic and manganese in the Kanker district have been found to cause impacts on the flora and fauna. A case study of episodic arsenical diarrhoea is presented.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of two arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), Dentiscutata heterogama and Rhizophagus manihotis on the growth and nutrition of Juglans venezuelensis Manning. This species is currently considered a threatened tree species and the successful restoration of its populations depends on an increased understanding of the ecological and physiological aspects of its response to inoculation with AMF. In general, shoot and total dry weight, and leaf area were significantly higher in seedlings inoculated with AMF than in non-inoculated ones. Differences in height and leaf number between the inoculated and non-inoculated treatments become apparent after of plant growth. Inoculated plants had a greater leaf area as the result of the higher allocation of resources to leaf biomass (leaf mass ratio, LMR). The fraction allocated to the roots (RMR) was not significantly different between treatments. Differences between vital stain (SDH) and non-vital trypan blue stain (TB) showed that the D. heterogama colonization was almost entirely active compared to the R. manihotis colonization. The relative responsiveness (RR) of J. venezuelensis to inoculation with D. heterogama and R. manihotis was 21.8 and respectively, but colonization values were never greater than despite low P content in the soils used. The growth and physiological responses of J. venezuelensis to inoculation with two AMF species indicate that these microorganisms should be employed when propagating this threatened species for its subsequence reintroduction into its natural habitat.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The reproductive phenology and germination behavior of 15 important tree species (Acer laevigatum, Adinandra griffithii, Citrus latipes, Elaeocarpus prunifolius, Engelhardtia spicata, Ilex embelioides, Ilex khasiana, Ilex venulosa, Illicium griffithii, Magnolia lanuginosa, Magnolia punduana, Photinia cuspidata, Photinia integrifolia, Quercus glauca and Schima khasiana) were monitored at monthly intervals for two calendar years in subtropical broad-leaved humid forests of Northeast India. These species are either endemic or threatened to the region. The investigated species showed peak flowering during the spring- while fruiting peak was observed in the autumn-season. Of the fruit types, drupes and follicles were produced by many of these species. Majority of the species adopted zoochoric mode of dispersal. The germination phenology revealed that most of the species (Acer laevigatum, Elaeocarpus prunifolius, Illicium griffithii, Magnolia lanuginosa, Magnolia punduana and Quercus glauca) undergo a period of dormancy during winter season and germination collides with the onset of rain indicating that moisture aids in germination. The prevailing environmental condition coupled with human disturbance seems to be of potential importance in influencing the recruitment of the selected species. Such studies would help in formulating effective strategies for conservation of these species.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'During the second half of the 20th century, the Ganga River ecosystem has been continuously altered by several ongoing anthropogenic processes, accommodating multi-dimensional pressure due to increase of nearly four-fold human population.

Few studies have investigated the natural stock of germinable seeds in the gallery forests to evaluate their regeneration potential, although they are target of anthropogenic action. Thus, seasonal, horizontal, and vertical qualitative and quantitative variations of the seed bank of a gallery forest in the Brazilian Cerrado were studied to test the influence of the climatic seasonality, the influence of the physical structure, and depth of the soil in different microhabitats of the forest in this natural seed store. It was also compared the richness and abundance of species in the germinable seed bank with the above-ground vegetation. Three hundred and seventy-five soil samples were collected at the beginning (April 1998 and 1999) and at the end of the dry season (September 1998). These samples were collected in three microhabitats distributed transversally in relation to drainage line of a large stream, at five depths. The density of germinable seeds decreases with depth, and is similar among microhabitats and seasons. In of soil and of litter, 1390 seedlings emerged, being 743 dicotyledons and 647 monocotyledons. From 761 survivors, 263 were Cyperaceae, 206 Melastomataceae, 153 Poaceae, and 82 Onagraceae, the most abundant families. This study suggests that the diversity of the germinable soil seed bank is lower than that of the above-ground vegetation of the forest, and that the soil seed bank is not the principal regeneration form of this environment.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Factors affecting in vitro propagation were evaluated for Ceropegia attenuata Hook., an endemic and endangered plant having ornamental potential but a limited reproductive capacity. Rapid shoot multiplication from nodal explants was established using varying concentrations of cytokinins and auxins either alone or in combinations. The highest frequency of shoot induction was achieved when nodal explants were inoculated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 6-benzylaminopurine with a mean of shoots per explant. High concentrations of TDZ and KN resulted in stunted and vitrified shoots. Factors implicated in the promotion of floral transition of the C. attenuata have been identified which are 4-amino-3, 5, 6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram), 6-benzylaminopurine, sucrose and photoperiod. The highest frequency of flowering (100%) was obtained when axillary shoot explants were transferred to MS medium supplemented with picloram within of culture. Transfer of in vitro regenerated shoots to half strength MS medium with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) showed maximum root induction. The in vitro grown plantlets were successfully acclimatized in the glasshouse with 85% of survival and showed normal development.

Pollution of the biosphere with toxic metals has accelerated dramatically since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. In present review, comparative assessment of traditional chemical technologies and phytoremediation has been reviewed particularly in the context of cost-effectiveness. The potential of phytoremediation and green chemicals in heavy metals management has been described critically. Further, the review explores our work on phytoremediation as green technology during the last and hand in hand addresses the various ecological issues, benefits and constraints pertaining to heavy metal pollution of aquatic ecosystems and its phytoremediation as first case study. Second case study demonstrates the possible health implications associated with use of metal contaminated wastewater for irrigation in peri-urban areas of developing world. Our researches revealed wetland plants/macrophytes as ideal bio-system for heavy metals removal in terms of both ecology and economy, when compared with chemical treatments. However, there are several constraints or limitations in the use of aquatic plants for phytoremediation in microcosm as well as mesocosm conditions. On the basis of our past researches, an eco-sustainable model has been proposed in order to resolve the certain constraints imposed in two case studies. In relation to future prospect, phytoremediation technology for enhanced heavy metal accumulation is still in embryonic stage and needs more attention in gene manipulation area. Moreover, harvesting and recycling tools needs more extensive research.

Land use categories included homegarden, patio, rubber, tea plantation, and secondary forest and scrub. Land holdings varied in size between 0.18 and 1.34 hectares and comprised 39% tea land, 27% homegarden, 12% patio, 17% secondary forest and scrub land, and 4% rubber plantation. We identified a total of 268 plant species on the ten properties in a total of 216 genera and 84 families across all growth habits combined (trees, shrubs, herbs and climbers). Our results show three times the plant species richness in homegardens than for any similar research on tree gardens elsewhere, but a large proportion are exotic and almost all have some kind of utilitarian purpose. The top three tree species are palms in homegardens which represent over two-thirds of the stem density and half the basal area.

The results show that soaking in gibberellic acid (GA3) for incubation of seeds at for and alternate water soaking and drying for significantly increased the percentage germination compared to the control. Desiccation of seeds down to 10% moisture content resulted in better germination. Germination of S. nux-vomica seeds differed significantly between different storage periods, moisture contents of the seed and for first and second order interactions (p<0.001). The highest germination (92%) was achieved when seeds with 10% moisture content were stored at ambient temperature for Evidence from the present study indicates that S. nux-vomica seeds possess physiological dormancy that can be broken effectively by after-ripening.

We studied one such intervention in the state of Gujarat and its implications for sustainability. In this project, small and marginal farmers after being introduced to new economic activities were pooled together into a larger cooperative network that in turn fed into a company. This organisation created its own brand, used modern technology and accessed markets all over India. The idea of this experiment came from a well known NGO with experience of working in rural India. This experiment was a novel way of bringing poor farmers into the structure of a modern and reasonably large, market-driven enterprise, without creating wage labour or dispossessing people from their lands. The lessons from the experiment indicate the importance of understanding that participation and empowerment cannot be attained through a mechanical, target-driven and time bound approach.

Land cover and vegetation were spatially analyzed by digitally classifying IRS 1D LISS III satellite data using a maximum likelihood algorithm. Later, the variations in structure and diversity in different forest types and classes were quantified by adopting quadratic sampling procedures. Nine land-cover types were delineated: teak forest, dense mixed forest, degraded mixed forest, Sal mixed forest, open mixed forest, young teak plantation, grasslands, agriculture, habitation, and water bodies. The classification accuracy for different land-use classes ranged from 71.23% to 100%. The highest accuracy was observed in water bodies and grassland, followed by habitation and agriculture, teak forest, degraded mixed forest, and dense mixed forest.

In this study, the sorptive response of the three most commonly found divalent metal contaminants, copper (Cu+2), lead (Pb+2), and zinc (Zn+2), are studied using two locally available semi-arid soils from Saudi Arabia. To enhance their retention capacity, these soils are amended with lime. The response to sorption at varying initial contaminant concentrations, pH conditions, temperature levels, and dilution ratios are investigated. Relying on empirical models (Langmuir and Freundlich), the nature of sorption (monolayer or heterogeneous) is ascertained. Further, kinetic models are employed to validate the type and nature of sorption that occurs (whether pseudo first-order or second-order). It is found that the experimental results correlate well with these empirical models for both the Al-Ghat and Al-Qatif soils when amended with lime and attenuate Cu, Pb, and Zn to satisfactory levels.

The C stocks of tree, understory, deadwood, litter, and soil ranged from 45.4 to 135.6, 0.08 to 1.18, 0.7 to 6.8, 1.1 to 1.4, and respectively, which accounted for 61.3, 0.2, 1.4, 0.8, and of the total carbon stock. BU forest accounted from soil C and from biomass, whereas PD forest contributed only from soil C and from biomass. Of the total C stock in the soil, about was stored in the upper Soil C stocks in BU forest were significantly higher than those in other forests. The variability of C pools of different ecosystem components is influenced by vegetation type, stand structure, management history, and altitude. Our results reveal that a higher percentage of C is stored in biomass and less in soil in these temperate forests except at the higher elevation broad-leaved BU forest. Results from this study will enhance our ability to evaluate the role of these forests in regional and global C cycles and have great implications for planning strategies for conservation. The study provides important data for developing and validating C cycling models for temperate forests.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Invasive alien organisms can impact adversely on indigenous biodiversity, while riparian invasive alien trees (IATs), through shading of the habitat, can be a key threat to stream invertebrates. We ask here whether stream fauna can recover when the key threat of riparian IATs is removed. Specifically, we address whether IAT invasion, and subsequent IAT removal, changes benthic macroinvertebrate and adult dragonfly assemblages, for the worse or for the better respectively. Natural riparian zones were controls. There were statistically significant differences between stream reaches with natural, IAT-infested and IAT-cleared riparian vegetation types, based on several metrics: immature macroinvertebrate taxon richness, average score per macroinvertebrate taxon (ASPT), a macroinvertebrate subset (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata larvae; EPTO), and adult dragonfly species richness. Reaches with natural vegetation, or cleared of IATs, supported greater relative diversity of macroinvertebrates than reaches shaded by dense IATs. Greatest macroinvertebrate ASPT and EPTO were in reaches bordered by natural vegetation and those bordered by vegetation cleared of IATs, and the lowest where the riparian corridor was IATs. Highest number of adult dragonflies species was along streams cleared of dense IATs. Overall, results showed that removal of a highly invasive, dense canopy of alien trees enables recovery of aquatic biodiversity. As benthic macroinvertebrate scores and adult dragonfly species richness are correlated and additive, their combined use is recommended for river condition assessments.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Molecular genetic fingerprints of nine Curcuma species from Northeast India were developed using PCR-based markers. The aim involves elucidating there intra- and inter-specific genetic diversity important for utilization, management, and conservation. Twelve random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), 19 Inter simple sequence repeats (ISSRs), and four amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primers produced 266 polymorphic fragments. ISSR confirmed maximum polymorphism of 98.55% whereas RAPD and AFLP showed 93.22 and 97.27%, respectively. Marker index and polymorphic information content varied in the range of and and and for RAPD, ISSR, and AFLP markers, respectively. The average value of number of observed alleles, number of effective alleles, mean gene diversity, and information index were and respectively, for three DNA markers used. Dendrograms based on three molecular data using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) was congruent and classified the Curcuma species into two major clusters. Cophenetic correlation coefficient between dendrogram and original similarity matrix were significant for RAPD ISSR and AFLP Clustering was further supported by principle coordinate analysis. High genetic polymorphism documented is significant for conservation and further improvement of Curcuma species.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'A land surface region can be decomposed into a series of watershed units with a hierarchical organizational structure. For loess landform, the watershed is a basic unit that can express natural landforms, surface morphology characteristics, spatial organization and developmental evolution. In this research we adopted the concept of node calibration in the watershed structure unit, selected six complete watersheds on China Loess Plateau as the research areas to study the quantitative characteristics of the hierarchical structure in terms of watershed geomorphology based on digital elevation model (DEM) data, and then built a watershed hierarchical structure model that relies on gully structure feature points. We calculated the quantitative indices, such as elevation, flow accumulation and hypsometric integral and found there are remarkably closer linear correlation between flow accumulation and elevation with increasing gully order, and the same variation tendency of hypsometric integral also presented. The results showed that the characteristics of spatial structure become more stable, and the intensity of spatial aggregation gradually enhances with increasing gully order. In summary, from the view of gully node calibration, the China Loess watershed structure shows more significantly complex, and the developmental situation variation of the loess landforms also exhibited a fairly stable status with gully order increasing. So, the loess watershed structure and its changes constructed the complex system of the loess landform, and it has the great significance for studying the spatial pattern and evolution law of the watershed geomorphology.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The genus Piper is well known for their medicinal and economic potentials and is distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Majority of the taxa under the genus Piper are morphologically confusing because of the wide range of variations within the vegetative characters.

The effect of season and of the interaction of season with vegetation type on ant species density, activity and composition were investigated. We also checked for a possible impact of army ant activity on the ant assemblage. Ants were collected by pitfall trapping in seven vegetation types in each of three seasons during 12 months in 2003 and Season significantly influenced the ground-dwelling ant assemblage. The late wet season had the lowest ant species density and a different species composition than the early wet and the dry season. Also inter-annual variation in ant species density and composition was detected and could partly be explained by an influence of Dorylus activity. In general, vegetation type and inter-annual variation had a larger influence on the ground-ant assemblage than season. Significant effects of interactions between season, year, vegetation type and army ants on the ant assemblage confirm that also in African rainforests ant assemblages are extremely dynamic and depend on a complex combination of availability of food resources, nest sites and predators.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Satellite Remote Sensing data has been used for vegetation mapping, initial stratification, distribution of sample plots and for calculating the area under different vegetation types.

Shrubs are long-neglected life form in the forest ecosystem, playing many roles in the forest and human life. Shrub has great impact on vegetation attributes which in turn modify the C storage and capture. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore the dynamics of shrub species in four fire regimes, viz. high, medium, low, and no fire zones of Bhoramdeo Wildlife Sanctuary of Kawardha forest division (Chhattisgarh), India. The variations in structure, diversity, biomass, productivity, and C sequestration potential in all the sites were quantified. The density and basal area of shrub varied from 1250 to 3750 individuals and 2.79 to respectively. The diversity indices showed that the value of Shannon index was highest in medium fire zone (3.77) followed by high, low, and no fire zones as 3.25, 3.12, and 2.32, respectively. The value of index or concentration of dominance (Cd) ranged from 0.08 to 0.20, species richness from 0.56 to 1.58, equitability from 1.41 to 1.44, and beta diversity from 1.50 to 4.20, respectively. The total biomass and C storage ranged from 6.82 to 15.71 and from 2.93 to respectively. The shrub density, importance value index (IVI), and abundance to frequency ratio (A/F) significantly correlated between high fire and medium fire zone. The basal area was found to be significantly positively correlated between high fire and medium fire, and low and no fire zones, respectively. Two-way cluster analysis reflected various patterns of clustering due to influence of the forest fire which showed that some species have distant clustering while some have smaller cluster. Principal component analysis (PCA) reflects variable scenario with respect to shrub layer. Ventilago calyculata and Zizyphus rotundifolia showed higher correlation between themselves in terms of basal area (BA). The total shrub production was while the C sequestration potential of under different fire regimes. Shrub community in the medium fire zone reflected higher productivity and higher C sequestration in comparison to other fire zone. Among the different plant parts, the biomass accumulation ratio was highest in the root of shrub community among various fire regimes. Screening of species for restoration and different land-use pattern on the basis of biomass accumulation and carbon sequestering potential would be an effective strategy for decision-making in sustainable forest management.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The present study was designed to note the birds occurring in the microhabitats of Bangalore University Campus, India.

Where ex-post evaluations are published, abandonment of introduced agroforestry after project cessation is often reported. This paper presents an analysis of agroforestry adoption in a poor, peri-urban village in semi-arid south India, where of initial adopters had retained their plots six to eight years after implementation. The intervention was facilitated by BAIF, an Indian non-governmental organisation specialising in natural resource management. The complex technological package promoted was known as and comprised fruit trees planted in crop fields, with a boundary of multi-purpose trees and integrated soil and water conservation measures. Sixty four agroforestry plots belonging to 43 households were surveyed in 2010/11 and interviews were held with both adopting and non-adopting farmers. Beyond retention, a quarter of adopters had expanded the practice on to additional areas of land and some diffusion to initially non-adopting farmers had also occurred. Adopters were found to have modified the practice to suit their own objectives, capabilities and constraints, highlighting that adoption is more than a simple binary choice. The study demonstrates the importance of external support for adoption of agroforestry. The intervention was not, however, especially pro-poor with adoption occurring disproportionately among relatively wealthier households with larger landholdings. Where poorer households adopted, this tended to occur later. Participation was entirely voluntary and, by 2011, conversion of suitable farmland to agroforestry had reached while beneficial to individual adopters, this patchy coverage arguably limits the potential for enhanced ecosystem service provision at landscape-scale.'\"], [\" the subject is provided. The systematic exploratory phase of taxonomy is said to have started around the middle of 16th century and with two major events, the subject reached its peak. The first one being the development of the concept of Herbarium and second one being the introduction of the Binomial System of Nomenclature by Linnaeus in 1753. Both the events laid the firm foundation for Classical Taxonomy. But during the last few decades with the development of Bio-systematic phase, although revolutionary changes in concepts of taxonomy could be noticed, the Classical Taxonomy got completely side tracked. Discussing the current status of Taxonomy  biology, faulty methods of teaching by untrained taxonomists in most Universities, lack of sufficient taxonomic literature and herbaria, synthetic nature of discipline of taxonomy, lack of sufficient number of practicing taxonomists and field botanists to carry out the survey and documentation of the vast diversity of the flora of India, most taxonomic journals with least or no impact factor, low citation index of Classical Taxonomists, development of computer databases and computer identification devices by non-taxonomists, molecular biologists side tracking the Classical Taxonomists in areas of biodiversity assessments, avoidance of taxonomists by modern biologists in programmes of Bioprospection, apathy towards the subject by fund giving bodies and lastly, least recognitions of Classical Taxonomists by scientific bodies are cited as prominent reasons for the decline of the subject. Although Botanical Survey of India has done a commendable job in accomplishing the tasks of Taxonomists, some how the organization has failed in generating and enthusing the required number of younger taxonomists and group specialists in the country. Worse is the case with many Universities who have, to some extent killed the subject. All these factors have collectively brought about a serious decline in the subject resulting in the acute shortage of younger generation of field botanists and taxonomists who are to shoulder the big responsibilities of inventorizing the rich biodiversity in the tropics. However, the situation is not that hopeless. The achievements of Classical Taxonomists during the last 4 decades in inventorization and documentation of the flora of the country is commendable.

It is palatable, even enticing, to most grazing animals. Feeding tests at the University of Florida demonstrated toxicity to rabbits. Pasture trials in Hawaii were promising for 10 yr, but when the plant amounted to 50% of the feed it proved toxic to cattle, sheep, goats, and fowl. The deep-rooted weed, with yard-long, prostrate runners, has become naturalized from Gainesville southward and has heavily invaded many pastures in southern Florida, especially on limestone. High intake is now associated with a fatal CNS syndrome in local horses, formerly linked by some to agricultural pesticides. The leaves and seeds contain indospicine, a toxic amino acid; the toxin was formerly reported to be acid.

Breeding potential of the vector in forest areas was found to be high in water stored in jungle pool (69.84%) followed by elephant footprints with clear water (39.13%) and with turbid water (26.19%), whereas in forest fringe areas, the vector breeding was more prominent in elephant footprints: 65.11% in clear water and 62.5% in turbid water. Although other habitats had shown only low breeding of the vector, all types of habitats were positively correlated with malaria occurrence. Cattle hoof marks and elephant footprint (turbid; explained nearly the same amount of variance. It was observed that deforestation as well as elephant habitat-type destruction had engendered conflicts intensively in fringe areas. Seasonal abundance pattern of this vector was found to vary in forest and forest fringe areas in relation to different habitats. Seasonal abundance of An. baimaii was significantly different in different habitats. The Tukey post hoc comparisons indicated that the abundance of An. baimaii in different habitats was significantly higher in monsoon season than that of premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons. No significant difference was observed between premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons. The findings therefore will eventually help to predict transmission of malaria in targeted area and in formulating an improved malaria control program in the northeastern region of India.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Fish distribution in relation to environmental variables was investigated in the Matla River of Sundarban estuarine system.

Fish assemblages showed significant seasonal variation as was revealed from MANOVA. MDS ordination plot based on similarity in the fish assemblages revealed that premonsoonal season was distinguishable from the monsoonal and postmonsoonal seasons. Notable differences were also evident between monsoon and postmonsoon. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that salinity, acidity, inorganic phosphate concentration and dissolved oxygen were the most important environmental variables in determining the observed variation in fish assemblages. Seasonal succession of fish populations may be related to differences in life cycle and adaptation to prevalent ecological conditions. The study therefore suggests that environmental variations in terms of changing salinity and dissolved oxygen have significant influence in structuring estuarine piscine community in this region.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'An efficient protocol was established for regeneration of Desmodium motorium via somatic embryogenesis.

Percent identity and phylogenetic analyses clearly indicated that the CMV isolate from black pepper (BP) belongs to subgroup IB. Sequence analyses also showed the presence of a rare deletion of nine nucleotides in the putative methyltransferase domain of 1a gene which was observed only in two more isolates of CMV among one hundred 1a gene sequences of CMV for which sequence information is available in the database. Interestingly this deletion is not present in the black pepper isolate of CMV from China (WN1) and from Indian long pepper that is closely related to black pepper. Percent identity analyses showed that the region (UTR) of the three RNAs of the BP isolate were conserved with 91% identity whereas the of three RNAs showed identity. The level of gene conservation among the subgroups was highest in coat protein and lowest in 2b. The values of nucleotide diversity studies were further consistent with the above data. The ratio of non-synonymous to the synonymous substitution of the five genes of three RNAs was in the order and less than one for all the genes, indicating purifying selection. These clearly reflect that the protein encoded by RNA1 is highly tolerant to amino acid changes followed by that of RNA2 and, RNA3 is the least tolerant correlating to its functional importance.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Genus Chlorophytum Ker Gawl secures its position chiefly as commercial plants with a wide range of applications, right from pharmaceutical to ornamental, and with a promising economical return also.

Great challenges are associated with its conventional propagation approach. The accomplishment and rapidity in the propagation of few species of Chlorophytum have constantly been a key concern for farmers and researchers. In this regard, in vitro propagation is an efficient technique to triumph over regeneration-associated problems. Available literature was surveyed rigorously to extract the information on pharmacological utilities and recent advancements in in vitro regeneration of genus Chlorophytum.

Based on the Landsat satellite images, in situ forest survey and archives, we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of C density and storage in a typical conservation area in Changting county in southeastern China, dominated by the pioneer tree Pinus massoniana forest. The results showed that the C density (storage) increased significantly from C C) in 1981 to C C) in 2015 and proved the success of ecological management adopted considering the interactions between local residential livelihoods and the features of local forest ecosystem. In addition, the differences of C density and storage across elevational and slope gradients also narrowed over the past The landscape also gradually shifted from lower C density to higher C density conditions based on the landscape metrics.

The adaptive variations among the collected populations were assessed based on the sink and float percentages of the seeds in water, the percentage of seed germination, total protein, carbohydrates and their growth ability such as shoot and root lengths. From this, we observed that the population had a significantly higher germination percentage of sinking seeds that were attributed to its relatively higher carbohydrate and protein contents than the floating seeds. A comparison of the seed population by cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis showed that the Chennai population constituted a single clade that was very distinct from the other nine populations, which were further grouped into two sub-clusters. They exhibited a trend consistent with their geographical proximity. Standardised t tests had revealed that the adaptive diversity of the P. amarus population was significantly affected by the geographic distance altitude minimum temperature and maximum temperature characteristics and geographical conditions were correlated along with 19 bioclimatic variables.

The study revealed the dominance of periodic growth deciduous species from a total of 25 tree species selected for phenological observation. The diversity of multipurpose trees in the homegardens is represented by different plant functional types with different phenological behavior which showed significant changes in their responses to inter-annual climatic variations. The diversity of tree species with different phenological behavior has implications for the temporal partitioning of resources, especially during periods of scarcity, thereby resulting in efficient utilization of resources such as water.

Forest disturbance intensity had no significant influence on the vertical distribution of fine root biomass in the profiles. According to correlation and principal components analyses, fractional canopy cover was the most important factor influencing FRBtot and FRNtot, whereas diameter at breast height, stand basal area, stem density, soil pH and base saturation had only a minor or no influence on root mass. A reduction in canopy cover from 90% (forest type A) to 75% (types C and D) was associated with a reduction in FRBtot by about 45% which indicates that timber extraction leads not only to canopy gaps but to corresponding in the soil as well. We conclude that forest encroachment that is widespread in large parts of South-east remaining rainforests significantly reduces tree fine root biomass and associated carbon sequestration, even if it is conducted at moderate intensities only.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Understanding the spatial patterns of species distribution is essential to characterize the structure of communities, to optimize species inventories and to evaluate the impact of biotic and abiotic variables. Here we describe the spatial structure of the distribution of leaf litter ant species, and of biotic factors that could explain it, in a subtropical semi-deciduous forest of the Argentinian Chaco, characterized by a dense understorey of shrubs and terrestrial bromeliads. Environmental variables (leaf litter quantity and ground bromeliad density) were measured and ants were collected in quadrats distributed along two transects at intervals of Overall 87 species were collected. Sixteen positive associations and a single negative association were observed between the 11 most frequent species taken pair-wise. Our results suggest that the spatial distribution of leaf litter ants was determined at two different scales. At a small scale (period below a periodic spatial structure, likely due to intraspecific competition, produced a succession of peaks of abundance separated by gaps. At a larger scale (period around periodically distributed environmental factors induced aggregates of colonies of species responding positively to these factors. A high quantity of leaf litter and, to a lesser extent, a high density of ground bromeliads promoted a high density and a high species richness of ants. Numerically dominant ants being generally positively associated, interspecific competition was apparently weak. All ant species whose abundance was correlated with an environmental factor were not completely spatially structured by it. This suggests that some other factors, such as intraspecific competition, may have counter-effects.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The present study estimates the net emission of carbon from the forest sector in India. For the reference year (1986), the gross emission from deforestation in that year, plus committed emissions from deforestation in the preceding years, is estimated to be 64 106 t of C. The carbon sequestration (or net woody biomass accumulation in trees for long-term storage) from the area brought under tree plantations and the existing forest area under forest succession is estimated to offset the gross carbon emission in India, leading to no net emissions of carbon from the forest sector. Medium-term projections for India (for the year 2011) show that under a as scenario at current rates of afforestation, projected carbon emissions would continue to be balanced by sequestration.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'In this study, we used fire count datasets derived from Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) satellite to characterize spatial patterns in fire occurrences across highly diverse geographical, vegetation and topographic gradients in the Indian region. For characterizing the spatial patterns of fire occurrences, observed fire point patterns were tested against the hypothesis of a complete spatial random (CSR) pattern using three different techniques, the quadrat analysis, nearest neighbor analysis and K function. Hierarchical nearest neighboring technique was used to depict the of fire incidents. Of the different states, highest fire counts were recorded in Madhya Pradesh (14.77%) followed by Gujarat (10.86%), Maharastra (9.92%), Mizoram (7.66%), Jharkhand (6.41%), etc. With respect to the vegetation categories, highest number of fires were recorded in agricultural regions (40.26%) followed by tropical moist deciduous vegetation (12.72), dry deciduous vegetation (11.40%), abandoned slash and burn secondary forests (9.04%), tropical montane forests (8.07%) followed by others. Analysis of fire counts based on elevation and slope range suggested that maximum number of fires occurred in low and medium elevation types and in very low to low-slope categories. Results from three different spatial techniques for spatial pattern suggested clustered pattern in fire events compared to CSR. Most importantly, results from K statistic suggested that fire events are highly clustered at a lag-distance of 125 miles. Hierarchical nearest neighboring clustering technique identified significant clusters of fire in different states in northeast and central India. The implications of these results in fire management and mitigation were discussed.

Therefore, a review of Indian soils and their capacity to sequester carbon; and the factors favouring C sequestration under different land uses is in order. Several researchers, especially those in The National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning and the International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics monitored the changes in soil organic (SOC) and inorganic (SIC) carbon as influenced by land use in the Indo-Gangetic Alluvial Plains and black soil regions between 1980 and 2005. The results showed an increase in SOC stocks due to turnover of greater plant biomass into the soil. Results of long-term fertilizer experiments with rice-based double or triple cropping systems indicate capacity to store greater C, and maintain higher C in passive pools and that active fraction of soil C can be used as an indicator of soil health. The inclusion of active pool/labile SOC is expected to improve the performance of Century eco-system model in predicting SOC changes under different climatic conditions. Greenhouse gas emissions from the tropical Indian soils (both zeolitic and non-zeolitic) do not seem to contribute significantly to the global warming potential.

The new trigger is added as an additional criterion in the simplified scheme for deep convection. Seasonal forecasts are performed to evaluate the influence of the new triggering mechanism in the representation of the Indian summer monsoon in the CFSv2. The HCF trigger improves the seasonal representation of precipitation over the Indian subcontinent. The new triggering mechanism leads to a significant, albeit relatively small, improvement in the bias of seasonal precipitation totals. In addition, the new trigger improves the representation of the seasonal precipitation cycle including the monsoon onset, and the probability distribution of precipitation intensities. The mechanism whereby the HCF improves convection over India seems to be related not only to a better representation of the background state of atmospheric convection but also to an increase in the frequency in which SAS is triggered. As a result, there was an increase in convective precipitation over India favored by the availability of moist convective instability. The increase in precipitation intensity leads to a reduction in the dry bias.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'A limnological study of seventeen man-made lakes has been made.

An attempt has been made to provide a current situation and complete analysis of temple waste flowers (TWFs) with suggestions and recommendations. As a part of Clean India, Clean and Green Kovai (Green Coimbatore) mission, this paper gives an idea to reduce the volume of temple waste flowers by converting into activated carbon by direct pyrolysis process and chemical activation with sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid process, respectively. The products were analyzed and compared based on the results of physicochemical parameters including pH, conductivity, moisture content, ash content, volatile content, fixed carbon, bulk density, porosity, specific gravity, water soluble matter, acid soluble matter, iodine number, methylene blue number, yield, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (SBET) surface area. The structure, surface morphology, and chemical compositions of carbon were determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FeSEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), respectively. From the comparison of results, the activated carbon produced from temple waste flowers by direct pyrolysis process is fairly better due to low moisture content, low ash content, better yield, and higher surface area.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'A critical first step in establishing biosphere the Man and Biosphere Programme of to generate baseline information for future courses of action. The present study aims to assess the structure and composition of with anthropogenic pressures mounting on these forests in the buffer zone of one such biosphere Pachmarhi biosphere reserve of India. The quadrat method was employed for sampling vegetation, and information on anthropogenic pressures was collected by conducting interviews with local people and forest officials and collecting it from secondary sources. A total of 39 tree species were sampled in 82 quadrats; of these 26 tree species were in standing stage, 25 in sapling, and 35 in seedling. Chloroxylon swietenia emerged as the most dominant tree species having highest importance value index, followed by Tectona grandis, Terminalia tomentosa, and Hardwickia binata. Nine tree species and their saplings, including Sterculia urens and Terminalia arjuna, were exploited so badly that they were only found in the seedlings stage. The unavailability of standing trees of 12 important tree species including Aegle marmelos and Phyllanthus emblica indicates the intensity and gravity of anthropogenic pressures on these important tree species. If the present anthropogenic pressure continues, which has inhibited the regeneration of several tree species, then substantial negative ecological and societal consequences can be expected.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Alborz Mountains host Caspian Hyrcanian forest ecoregion along the northern slopes and forest steppe ecoregion in highlands. Hyrcanian forest covers the southeastern part of Caucasus biodiversity hotspot and is of great biogeographic importance. Altitudinal pattern and correlation between woody species biodiversity (DIV), forest structure ((stem density (DEN), mean basal area (MBA) and mean height class (MHC)) and disturbance (DIS) were explored along 2,400 m altitudinal gradient in Hyrcanian relict forest, Central Alborz Mountains. Vegetation changes from lowland forest (LoF) to midaltitude forest (MiF) and montane forest (MoF) in this area. The altitudinal gradient was divided into twelve 200 m elevational belts. Point centered quarter method (PCQM) with 96 sampling points and 83 vegetation samples by plot method (PM) were used to record field data. Shannon-Wiener index and Pearson coefficient were used for diversity and correlation analysis. The results showed that DEN decreased linearly, MBA and MHC showed relatively hump shaped and DIS showed a reverse hump shaped pattern of change along altitudinal gradient. Woody species diversity decreased non-steadily from LoF to MoF. Transitional vegetations of Carpinus-Fagus and Fagus-Quercus represented higher diversity of woody taxa compared to adjacent homogenous communities. Significant correlation was observed between altitude and all parameters: DEN with MBA, DIS and DIV; MBA with DIS; MHC with DIS along with DIV; and DIS with DIV at the study area scale. Surprisingly, correlation between studied parameters differed within each vegetation type. Altitude probably acts as a proxy for human and environmental driving forces in this area. Stability of warm and wet condition, season length, soil depth along with forest accessibility probably influences the altitudinal pattern of the studied parameters. Disturbance affects forest structure and consequently diversity; especially in lowlands. The obtained results recommend using both forest biodiversity and mensuration data in management process of forest ecosystems.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Genetic diversity of Pongamia pinnata, a plant species emerging as biodiesel source, was assessed using three endonuclease (TE)-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers.

A total of 138 markers were produced among 56 individuals of the three populations, of which 98% were polymorphic. For the individual populations, the percentage polymorphism was 58.69, 52.9 and 77.54 for DB, DT and DN, respectively. Average number of observed and effective alleles was also high in the wild populations in comparison to the bivoltine and trivoltine semi-domestic populations. Genetic diversity (Ht) in DB, DT and DN was and respectively and within-population genetic diversity (Hs) ranged from 0.166 to 0.259 with a mean of 0.189. Mean gene differentiation (GST) was found to be 0.25. diversity index was 0.278, 0.237 and 0.361 for DB, DT and DN and overall it was 0.391. Gene flow (Nm) among the populations was 1.509. The dendrogram produced by UPGMA with genetic distance matrices resulted in the formation of three major clusters separating the three populations. Considerable intra- and inter-population variability is found in all three populations. The population structure analysis further suggests that the semi-domestic populations of Daba ecorace are at the threshold of differentiating themselves. The high genetic variability present within wild Daba population of A. mylitta is of much importance for conservation as well as utilization in systematic breeding program.'\"], [\"Abstract: ' Human disturbance of habitat has important consequences for the demography, the morbidity, the behavior, and ultimately the survival of non-human primates. This paper is an effort to define, qualitatively, the potential influence of humans on monkey habitats and behavior in South Asia. Four variables are proposed and scored on a fourpoint scale. These variables can be used in comparisons within and between species. The four variables are description of the home range, level of harassment of the animals, habituation of the animals to humans, and the presence of predators. These measures are intentionally simple and conventional so that information may be retrieved from earlier field studies, and sites scored retrospectively.

Like other threatened plant species, the natural populations of the orchids are also severely threatened. Dendrobium thyrsiflorum is one such representative of the family Orchidaceae whose natural populations are getting destroyed at an alarming rate and deserves special conservation attention. Both direct shoot organogenesis (DSO) and indirect shoot organogensesis (ISO) pathways were experimented and the highest regeneration frequency for DSO and ISO pathways were found to be 86.2 and respectively. The regenerated shoots were best rooted in half-strength MS medium supplemented with indole butyric acid (IBA) and phloroglucinol. The genetic stability of the acclimatized plants derived from ISO and DSO pathways was assessed using Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR) and Start Codon Targeted (SCoT) molecular markers. SCoT proved to be a superior marker over ISSR in detecting clonal variability. The phytochemical analysis of the micropropagated plants also revealed a comprehensively higher yield of various secondary metabolites with significantly higher antioxidant potentials in both ISO- and DSO-derived plants over the mother plant. However, the ISO-derived plants were more phytochemically enriched compared to the DSO-plants. The rapid multiplication rate, higher genetic stability and secondary metabolite production ensures the utility of this micropropagation method for D. thyrsiflorum in the ex situ conservation and commercial exploitation of other important orchid species.'\"], [\"Pythium aphanidermatum '\"], [\"Abstract: ' Zingiber zerumbet (L) Smith, a wild clonal species related to the cultivated ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe), is a potential resistance donor for soft rot disease in ginger caused by Pythium aphanidermatum (Edson) Fitzp.

Comparison of mean profiles indicates the monsoon boundary layer to be much different from the trade wind boundary layer. Results confirm the existence of a boundary-layer jet known as East African or Somali Jet. Regions of multiple cloud layers at roughly the height of the capping inversion layer were associated with the jet. Regions in which a more well-mixed layer was observed showed a jet structure depressed in height. A free-jet surface-layer model appears to describe the mean wind structure of this jet observed during the present study and by others. An approximate balance of forces was found in the monsoon boundary layer between friction, advective acceleration, Coriolis and pressure gradient forces. Friction and advective acceleration terms were significant in the lower levels of the boundary layer. Forces in a typical trade wind boundary layer were found to be approximately one order of magnitude smaller than those observed in the monsoon boundary layer.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'A population of the S.

Comparison with other Barbus species of the same general region led to the conclusion that the patterns of reproductive investment ofB. melanampyx are similar to those of perennial species, and different from those of wet-season spawners. The reasons for this rather unexpected result were found in the more constant conditions prevailing during a dry season as compared to the monsoon.

Our results show that the two sympatric macaques differ in diet, activity budget, and habitat use: (1) out of the 131 plant species that were used by both macaque species as food over the year, only 15 plant species were shared. Rhesus macaques used more plant species as major foods, and had higher dietary diversity and evenness indexes than Assamese macaques. (2) Assamese macaques fed predominantly on leaves, whereas rhesus macaques fed more selectively on fruits. The rhesus diet varied according to season, and was significantly correlated to season fluctuation in fruit availability. (3) Assamese macaques devoted more time to resting, and less time to feeding than rhesus macaques (4) Assamese macaques were present mostly on the cliff, and tended to stay on the ground, whereas rhesus macaques were present mostly on the hillside, and showed preference to lower and middle canopy.

We illustrate the utility of our proposed methodology by integrating (i) abundance estimates of tigers in wildlife reserves from intensive photographic methods, and (ii) estimates of tiger habitat occupancy from indirect sign surveys, conducted over a wider region. We also investigate whether the random effects which represent the spatial association due to the CAR structure have any confounding effect on the fixed effects of the regression coefficients.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Consumption of greens is a major source of vitamins and micro-nutrients for people using only vegetarian diets rich in carbohydrates. In remote rural settlements where vegetable cultivation is not practiced and market supplies are not organized, local inhabitants depend on indigenous vegetables, both cultivated in kitchen gardens and wild, for enriching the diversity of food. Knowledge of such foods is part of traditional knowledge which is largely transmitted through participation of individuals of households. A total of 123 households in six villages of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve buffer zone was surveyed using a schedule to assess the knowledge, availability and consumption pattern of wild leafy vegetables. Quantity estimations were done using regular visits with informants from 30 sample households of the six study villages during the collections. Monetization was used to see the value of wild leafy vegetables harvested during a year. The diversity of wild leafy vegetables being use by the local inhabitants is 21 species belonging to 14 genera and 11 families. This is far less than that being reported to be used by the communities from Western Ghats in India and some parts of Africa. Irrespective of social or economic status all households in the study villages had the knowledge and used wild leafy vegetables. The number of households reported to consume these wild leafy vegetables is greater than the number of households reporting to harvest them for all species except for Diplazium esculentum and Phytolacca acinosa. The availability and use period varied for the species are listed by the users.

The overexploitation resulted in abandoning many shallow tubewells in the basin. The main intent of this study is the development of a 2-D groundwater flow and transport model of the basin using the Visual MODFLOW package for analyzing the aquifer response to various pumping strategies. The simulation model was calibrated and validated satisfactorily. Using the validated model, the groundwater response to five pumping scenarios under existing cropping conditions was simulated. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that the Balasore aquifer system is more susceptible to the river seepage, recharge from rainfall and interflow than the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities and specific storage. Finally, based on the modeling results, salient management strategies are suggested for the long-term sustainability of vital groundwater resources of the Balasore groundwater basin. The most promising management strategy for the Balasore basin could be: a reduction in the pumpage from the second aquifer by 50% in the downstream region and an increase in the pumpage to 150% from the first and second aquifer at potential locations.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The size class distribution in tree populations will continue to be used for analysing the regeneration of tree species and successional patterns in forest communities at extensive levels.

Though substantial energy savings can be achieved in the housing sector through implementation of various carbon mitigation options, it was stated that the incremental cost of implementing energy efficient measures is estimated to vary between 3 and 5% for residential houses. The challenge before the engineers, architects and other professionals associated with building construction sector is to find out appropriate technologies that will ensure reduction of GHG emission without increasing cost of construction. As majority of construction in government sector will come from construction of small residential house belonging to Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) as part of commitment to provide housing for all by 2020, assessment of GHG reduction potential of various cost-effective construction technologies is very essential to provide guidance to the stakeholders. This paper has surveyed various prevalent construction technologies in different parts of the country, analyzed the cost and embodied GHG emission for construction of the building envelope by collecting data through extensive search of literature and information obtained from construction sites. It has been found that there is ample scope of adoption of location-specific, cost-effective and eco-friendly construction technologies for construction of houses for EWS which are capable of reduction of GHG emission without any increase in cost of construction.

Among the two lagoons, the former is coast perpendicular, and the latter is coast parallel. An analysis of the textural characteristics reveals that, in both lagoons, the estuarine mouth and areas close to it are dominated by sand and sand-rich sediment species, indicating a high-energy depositional regime prevailing the region. On the other hand, the silt and clay dominant arms are almost sheltered and enjoy a low-energy depositional environment. The nutrient and organic carbon contents in the sheltered areas are significantly higher than the most dynamic high-energy estuarine mouth regions. This peculiar behaviour of these coastal water bodies has to be given adequate importance while laying down strategies for the conservation and management of these fragile aquatic systems in the south-western coast of India in particular and tropical coasts of the world in general.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Avifaunal study was carried out in Panipat refinery area before and after commissioning.

These are examined with particular reference to their regional variation in order to make an assessment of the magnitude of the food security challenge they pose for the country. Recent official estimates of groundwater exploitation in India are compared with actual negative physical, social and economic consequences of over-exploitation, as are evident in different regions, and their implications for national food security discussed. The analyses show that the real food security and water management challenge lies in the mismatch between water availability and agricultural water demand: high demands occur in water scarce but agriculturally prosperous regions and low demands in naturally water-abundant but agriculturally backward regions. Serious groundwater depletion problems, which occur in the naturally water-scarce but surplus food-producing regions, magnify the challenge. The small area of arable land per capita is a major reason for low agricultural water demand in regions that have abundant water. Sustainability of well irrigation in the naturally water-scarce regions, which is the backbone of food security, could be achieved through judicious investment in surface water projects which encourage direct irrigation and replenishment of over-exploited aquifers. Other strategies include: pro rata pricing of electricity in the farm sector; volumetric pricing of water from public irrigation systems; improving the efficiency of utilization of green water or the rainwater held in the soil profile; preventing depletion of the residual soil moisture in the field after crop harvest by reducing the fallow period; and reducing the use of water through a shift to low water consuming crops'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Palaeoclimate and Palaeoecological study was carried out in m sediment core deposited since 4 ka in an estuarine environment along Uppanar River mouth, Cauvery Delta.

Our objective was to improve understanding of the addition of organic matter and nutrients to soil from the litter of two abundant highland bamboo species, species that support the local population of the region in many ways. N concentration and N/P ratio were significantly higher (p<0.01) in leaf litter of P. bambusoides. Significantly, larger values of lignin concentration, C/N ratio, and lignin/N ratio were found in the sheath litter of A racemosa. Weight loss of both leaf and sheath litter was strongly positively correlated with N and N/P ratio, and significantly negatively correlated (p<0.01) with C/N ratio. Lignin/N had a negative correlation with decay rate. In both species, only lignin concentration of the litter showed strong positive correlation with N release. Litter decomposition and N release patterns were similar for the two bamboo species, whereas, P release rate from leaf litter was higher in P. bambusoides and differed significantly between sheath and leaf litter for both species.

This could be due to the large amount of nutrients stored in cotyledons of big sized J. curcas seeds. Further results showed that the removal of cotyledons (metabolic reserves) immediately after seed germination did not increase MD of J. curcas. Workers from different countries have reported variable results on this aspect and it is generally admitted that different populations, varieties, cultivars or strains of any specific cultivated crop may react differently to different situations such as inoculation with AM fungi. Therefore, it will be worthwhile to test the different populations of J. curcas from various locations under a given set of conditions.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'This paper tries to understand the soil erosion characteristics in a tropical plateau fringe region by the use of Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Soil loss estimation is an important phenomenon to understand the land degradation. An integrated method needs to be adopted in tropical plateau fringe region to estimate the soil loss. RUSLE has been adopted for the present study. The river in the basin under consideration sees its origin from a plateau top region and flows through the plateau fringe region of eastern Chotanagpur plateau, India. The present study area reflects undulated plateau fringe landform with gently sloping dissected plateau topography. The different factors like, rainfall erosivity factor (R), soil erodibility factor (K), topographic factor (LS), crop and management factor (C), and support and practice factor (P) have been enumerated using field and remote sensing data. Each factors result has also been verified with previous literature. All factors have been multiplied in GIS environment to estimate soil loss. High-magnitude soil loss region covers 4.88% of the total area and extends up to the upper reaches of the watershed. Topographic and soil factors best represent this loss. Low-magnitude soil loss region in the lower reaches of the watershed is a result of successful land management activity. Soil erosion is dominated process of land degradation in the upper reaches of the watershed and estimation of soil loss is an important input for land-use land-cover management. The study also inferred that RUSLE soil erosion model could be effectively used in tropical plateau fringe environment.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The southwestern coast of India is drained by many small rivers with lengths less than and catchment areas less than These rivers are perennial and are also the major drinking water sources in the region. But, the fast pace of urbanization, industrialization, fertilizer intensive agricultural activities and rise in pilgrim tourism in the past four to five decades have imposed marked changes in water quality and solute fluxes of many of these rivers. The problems have aggravated further due to leaching of ionic constituents from the organic-rich (peaty) impervious sub-surface layers that are exposed due to channel incision resulting from indiscriminate instream mining for construction-grade sand and gravel. In this context, an attempt has been made here to evaluate the water quality and the net nutrient flux of one of the important rivers in the southwestern coast of India, the Manimala river which has a length of about and catchment area of The river exhibits seasonal variation in most of the water quality parameters (pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, HCO3, NO2-N, NO3-N, chloride, SO4, and SiO2). Except for NO3-N and SiO2, all the other parameters are generally enriched in non-monsoon samples than that of monsoon The flux estimation reveals that the Manimala river transports an amount of of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, and of SO4, and K into the receiving coastal waters. These together constitute about 23% of the total dissolved fluxes transported by the Manimala river.

Sole cropped Sorghum bicolor and Acacia saligna were compared with the agroforestry combination in an alley cropping system in semiarid Northern Kenya. Three methods for the calculation of root production were used: the max-min, balancing-transfer and compartment-flow method. The highest root biomass was found in the topsoil for all cropping systems, though trees had a deeper root system. Trees and crops had a similar amount of below-ground biomass during the vegetation period (0.3 and 0.4 Mg DM ha-1 120 cm-1), but in the agroforestry combination root biomass was more than the sum of the sole cropped systems (1.1 Mg DM ha-1 120 cm-1). The tree system showed a very static root development with little fluctuation between seasons, whereas root biomasses were very dynamic in the crop and tree + crop systems. Root production was highest in the tree + crop combination with 2.1 Mg DM ha-1 a-1, with about 50% less in sole cropped trees and crops. Root N input to soil decreased in the order tree + crop>tree>crop system with 13.5, 11.0 and 3.2 kg N ha-1 a-1, and cannot be estimated from total below-ground biomass or carbon turnover, as N is accumulated in senescing roots. Such low N input to soil stresses the need for investigating other processes of nutrient input from roots to soil. Areas of highest N input were identified in the topsoil under the tree row in the tree system.

Biomass reflects the health and environmental conditions of a forest ecosystem. In context to the climate change mitigation mechanisms like REDD (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), an extensive forest monitoring campaign is especially important. Remote sensing of forest structure and biomass with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) bears significant potential for mapping and understanding forest ecological processes. Limitations of the conventional forest inventory procedures, like the extensive cost, labor and time, can be overcome through integrated geospatial techniques. Optical sensor or SAR data are suitable for extracting information about simple and homogeneous forest stand sites. However, optical sensors face serious limitations, specifically in tropical regions, like the cloud cover that SAR can overcome along with targeting saturation and penetration aspects. Simultaneous use of spectral information and image texture parameters improves the biomass assessment over undulating terrain and in radical conditions. Also, synergic use of multi-sensor optical and SAR has better potential than single sensor. Interferometric (InSAR) and polarimetric (PolSAR) SAR or a combination of the both (PolInSAR) serves as effective alternatives. These techniques could serve as valuable methods for biomass assessment of heterogeneous complex biophysical environments. However, SAR data have its own limitations and complexities. Identifying, understanding and solving major uncertainties in different stages of the biomass estimation procedure are critical.

It is conventionally propagated by hardwood and softwood cuttings, but about is needed before the rooted cuttings can be transplanted to the field. Propagation by seed is undesirable as populations are heterozygous and seed propagation leads to wide variations in tree and fruit characteristics. Several studies have been conducted on in vitro culture of pomegranate, and protocols have been developed for plant regeneration through organogenesis and embryogenesis from various types of explants. Tissue culture has enabled mass propagation of superior genotypes of both wild and cultivated varieties. However, successful application of tissue culture systems for genetic engineering of pomegranate is still limited. Molecular markers are essential for identification and discrimination of genotypes for genetic conservation, crop improvement, breeding programs, and commercialization of superior genotypes. These techniques may also be applicable to rapid identification and indexing of disease-free planting material.

However, rainfall recorded at the nearest meteorological station at Leh did not corroborate with the flood severity. For better understanding of this event, hydrological analysis and atmospheric modeling are carried out in tandem. Two small catchments were studied along the stream continuum to assess the flood characteristics to identify the cloudburst impact zones. Peak flood discharges were estimated close to the head wall region and at the catchment outlet of the Leh town and the Sabu eastern tributary catchments. Storm runoff depth is estimated by developing a triangular hydrograph by using the known time base of the flood hydrograph. This triangular hydrographs have been transformed further into storm hydrographs to gain a better understanding of the storm duration by using the dimensionless hydrograph method at selected cross sections. Storm duration is estimated by using the relationship between time to peak and time of concentration of the catchment. The peak flood estimates ranged from m3/s for Leh town catchment m3/s for Sabu eastern tributary catchment to m3/sec for Sabu catchment To assess the atmospheric processes associated with this event, a triple nest simulation (27, 9 and is performed using Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) modeling system.

However, due to various natural and anthropogenic activities, about 12.6% of land areas (excluding snow-covered area) in India are prone to landslide posing threat to life and property. Moreover, many structures in the hilly terrain of India are non-engineered which results in high vulnerability of buildings. Therefore, assessment of physical vulnerability is a fundamental step in reducing landslide risk. The study aims to present a methodology to assess vulnerability of the buildings using indicator-based approach at site-specific scale. Several studies to assess vulnerability of buildings due to landslides have been carried out by researchers from European countries. But these methodologies cannot be implemented successfully in India because of different geological and climatic condition. The different components of the discussed methodology for physical vulnerability of buildings exposed to landslides such as landslide intensity (a function of landslide velocity and volume) and resistance of buildings (a function of structural and non-structural features) are worked out and suggested by different researchers. However, putting them together, to present as a framework (specifically in Indian scenario) is the novelty of the present work.

In this paper, we analyse the correspondence between human development index, as an indicator adopted by governments to assess QoL, and the elements defined by local people as important in their QoL, called here local means. Using a free-listing technique, we collected information from 114 individuals from Kodagu, Kartanataka (India), to capture local means defining QoL. We then compared local means with the indicators used by Human development report (HDR) of Karnataka, the main measurement tool of QoL in Kodagu. The list of local means included access to basic facilities and many issues related to agriculture and natural resources management as elements locally defining QoL. We also found that HDR does not capture the means defined by people as indicators of QoL.

The present analysis supports a narrow conception of Durioneae (excludingCamptostemon andPapuodendron) and confirms a close relationship withHelicteres, Reevesia, Ungeria, andTriplochiton (all of traditional Sterculiaceae). Phylogenetic relationships within Durioneae were inferred from a combined analysis ofndhF and ITS sequences. These data suggest thatNeesia is sister to a clade comprising all other five genera of core Durioneae, and thatCoelostegia +Kostermansia form a clade that is sister toCullenia +Boschia +Durio. Various morphological features support these relationships. However, characters usually considered diagnostic for the entirety of Durioneae, such as a densely lepidote lower leaf surface and uni- or polylocular anthers, appear to be apomorphic within this clade. Likewise, spiny fruits and large arils covering the seeds are not plesiomorphic for Durioneae, in contradiction to Corner\\'s classic Durian Theory. The phylogeny suggests that bat- and bird-pollination evolved from beetle-pollination and that this transition was coincident with extensive androecial modification. Similarities due to convergent evolution of floral traits in relation to pollination by birds and mammals probably account for the erroneous, traditional placement of Durioneae in Bombacaceae.\"'], [\"Abstract: ' This study showed that Themachhi is genetically very close to C. medica and consistently grouped with the typical citron in all the phylogenetic trees; hence revealed the identity of as a natural wild type of C. medica.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The present study aims to investigate the spatial and temporal variation of meteorological drought in the Parambikulam-Aliyar basin, Tamil Nadu using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) as an indicator of drought severity.

Building upon recent work of feminist political ecology, I uncover a number of dualisms attached to the gender-nature nexus and put forward that gender roles are constituted by social relations which need to be analysed with regard to the transformative potential of gender-nature relations. Three main themes are at the centre of the empirical inquiry: gender subjectivities, rural off-farm employment and the human-nature nexus. I seek to show that, first, the production of gendered subjectivities cannot be simplified through essentialist assumptions that romanticise relationships with nature; second, off-farm employment strategies both reinforce the social hierarchy in gender and contradict the moral economies; and, finally, environmental and agrarian change redefine the use of agrobiodiversity and are related to ideas on progressive versus nonprogressive cultivation practices. The research is informed by qualitative research methods and offers a conceptual approach to the deconstruction of gender-nature relations from a poststructuralist feminist perspective.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The island of Madagascar ranks second to the neotropics in diversity of Bignoniaceae. Tribe Coleeae (Bignoniaceae) is a monophyletic group of tropical trees endemic to Madagascar and surrounding islands. The Masoala assemblage of Coleeae, in northeastern Madagascar, utilizes four mechanisms for avoiding competition via niche specialization: (1) morphologically via characters that comprise syndromes, explaining part of the pattern in this system although the syndrome concept is not perfect; (2) spatially via vertical stratification and potentially pollen placement; (3) temporally via phenological stagger; (4) ethologically via flowering duration and display. The 13 sympatric species of understory treelets and canopy trees did receive low flower visitor numbers. Contrary to the prevailing view of pollination systems where generalized systems predict equivalency between floral traits and pollinators, I found that different pollinators pollinated the 13 species of trees, that floral characters of different trees did not overlap in multidimensional phenotype space, and that few species of trees were visited by more than two pollinator groups. The use of multiple niches is potentially important in understanding both the origin and maintenance of tropical tree diversity.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The Swiss stone Pine (Pinus cembra L.) is an alpine species, fairly commonly occurring in the Alps and the Carpathians, close to the timberline.

However, seasonality in both fig and leaf production has been noted in almost all published phenological studies. We have addressed the following questions in the present study: (1) Are reproductive and vegetative phenologies seasonal and, consequently, related to climate? (2) Does Ficus citrifolia produce ripe figs year round? (3) Is the fig development related to climate? And, (4) Are reproductive and vegetative phenologies independent? By investigating these questions with a F. citrifolia population over a two-year period, at the southern edge of the tropical region in Brazil, we detected phenological seasonality that was significantly correlated with climate. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Trees became deciduous during the cold and dry months; (2) The flowering onset was asynchronous among individuals, but with moderate concentration during the hot and rainy months; (3) There was a correlation between the onset of flowering and vegetative phenology, with significantly higher crop initiations in individuals with full-leaf canopy; (4) Fig developmental time was longer in cold months; and (5) Ripe fig production occurred year-round and was not correlated with climate. Our results suggest that there are strong selection pressures that maintain the year-round flowering phenology in figs, for we have observed little seasonality in the phenology of such species despite the strong seasonality in the environment.'\"], ['Abstract: Abstract not available'], [\"Abstract: 'A highly reproducible and efficient in vitro shoot regeneration system was developed in a potential medicinal plant, Albizia lebbeck using root explants.

We find that the pursuit of adaptiveness will take place partly outside the range of human experience in a context of large differences in exposure and vulnerabilities, disparate interests and unequal power. Anticipatory policies and actions to adapt and improve adaptive capacity to the transboundary impacts of changes in water-use, land-use and climate on water resources and services are still in their infancy; but several problem-framing discourses are emerging that have longer-term implications for water governance. It is not yet clear how these competing policy-frames will evolve in Asia. Much will depend on how systems of water governance develop.

Approximately 7000 Soliga and 66000 non-Soliga people depend on the 540 km2 sanctuary for fuelwood. The demand for fuelwood is estimated to be 134.7 t d-1 or 49165 t y-1 against production of 66024 t y-1 for the entire sanctuary. Consumption patterns vary with the season and the altitude. The pressure for fuelwood is far greater on the fringe (85.8%) than in the core (14.2%). The fuelwood supply emanates from an activity zone of 20.1% of the total forest area which produces only 27% of the total demand. Furthermore, only selected species are preferred for fuel use, indicating that only a certain percentage of total productivity is available for extraction. Thus, the demandsupply gap is far greater than it actually appears.

To disentangle how mixed-species flocks change as a function of local forest structure, we analyzed flock characteristics (particularly species richness, flocking frequency and propensity) and vegetation physiognomies along a presumed successional series (early, middle, and advanced) simultaneously in subtropical forests in southern China. As hypothesized, monthly point counts demonstrated that complexity of flocks increases with the progression of natural forest succession at a local scale. Advanced forests differed significantly from pioneering plantations with respect to vegetation structure, flock characteristics and constituents (especially for understory specialists). Importantly, forest succession affected flock patterns particularly in relation to the flocking propensity of regular species, and the frequency of nuclear species fulvetta Alcippe hueti), which in turn determined flocking occurrence at different successional stands. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that understory flocking species (mainly Timaliidae babblers) were significantly associated with intact native canopy cover, complex DBH diversity, as well as high densities of dead trees and large trees, representing a maturity level of successional stands. Our study reveals that the effect of natural forest succession on mixed-species bird flocks is species-specific and guild-dependent.

Africa has been labeled the man because of its perceived lower species diversity when compared to the Neotropics or South-East Asia. Understanding why, within a biome, certain regions have higher or lower species diversity provides important insights into the evolution of biodiversity. I review the evidence in favor of an man pattern and the different hypotheses that have been advanced to explain and test this pattern using recent ecological, biogeographical and diversification studies. The man pattern has yet to be formally tested using extensive inventory plot data (including non woody species) between all three major rain forest regions based on appropriate statistics in an area controlled manner. The lower species diversity is not the result of a single cause, but is probably linked to numerous intricate causes related to present and past events. Future comparative studies should combine numerous variables including novel ones such at plant functional diversity. Finally, though more extinction in Africa is apparent from the fossil record, it is still hard to precisely quantify to what degree extinction varied between the three major regions. Diversification studies of important tropical plant lineages tend to support higher speciation rates in the Neotropics and South-East Asia instead of higher extinction in Africa as the main cause explaining the differences in species diversity. The lower species diversity of African rain forests remains an understudied question with numerous preconceived and largely untested ideas for which we are still far from having a synthetic explanation. This review highlights that there are still very little intercontinental rain forest comparisons of plant species diversity hindering any solid conclusions.

Generation of digital elevation model (DEM) of a particular geographic region of interest is the primary goal and advantage of Cartosat-1 mission. To generate the most accurate DEM from Cartosat-1 stereo data, 34 GCP points were used, and 122 tie points are automatically extracted with the aid of LPS-2011. Here, an attempt has been made to study the quantitative hypsometric analysis of six sub-watersheds of the Kuttiyadi River Basin with a humid tropical setting, using Cartosat-1 DEM. An extension, CalHypso, an add-on tool to ArcGIS 9.2, was utilized to synthesize hypsometric data from Cartosat-1 DEM which reflects the erosional signature of sub-watersheds based on geological stages of development. From hypsometric analysis, it is found that three sub-watersheds are in old stage, and the remaining three are of mature stage.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Ridge top ecosystems (RTEs) are considered to be more sensitive to global warming as they are characterized by uniform sunlight exposure and low human interferences and hence are perfect places for monitoring and comparing the effects of climate change in species composition.

In this study, data of rainfall and soil moisture contents at different depths (10 cm, 20 cm, 40 cm and 60 cm) in forestland and vegetable plot in the Taihu Lake Basin, China were monitored and analyzed for characteristics of soil moisture variation and its response to several typical rainfall events. The following results were observed. First, great temporal variation of soil moisture was observed in the surface layer than in deeper layer in vegetable plot. In contrast, in forestland, soil moisture had similar variation pattern at different depths. Second, initial soil moisture was an important factor influencing the vertical movement of soil water during rainfall events. In vegetable plot, simultaneous response of soil moisture to rainfall was observed at 10- and 20-cm depths due to fast infiltration when initial soil was relatively dry. However, traditional downward response order occurred when initial soil was relatively wet. Third, critical soil horizon interface was an active zone of soil water accumulation and lateral movement. A less permeable W-B soil horizon interface (40-cm depth) in vegetable plot can create perched water table above it and elevate the soil water content at the corresponding depth. Fourth, the land cover was an effective control factor of soil moisture during small and moderate rainfall events. In the forestland, moderate and small rainfall events had tiny influences on soil moisture due to canopy and surface O horizon interception. Fifth, preferential flow and lateral subsurface interflow were important paths of soil water movement. During large and long duration rainfall events, lateral subsurface flow and preferential flow through surface crack or soil pipe occurred, which recharged the deep soil. However, in more concentrated large storm, surface crack or soil pipe connected by soil macropores was the main contributor to the occurrence of preferential flow.

This study investigated land use pattern and spatial heterogeneity of the ecotones among agricultural land, forest land, and grassland of the southeastern Da Hinggan Mountains in the northeastern China. The change of these delineated ecotones under different slopes and aridity conditions was analyzed by two landscape indices, edge density (ED) and core area percentage of landscape (CPL), to explore the inter-linkage between spatial structure of ecotones and socioeconomic development and land management. Specifically, the ecotones such as agriculture-forest (AF) ecotone, forest-grassland (FG) ecotone, and agriculture-forest-grassland (AFG) ecotone moved from the arid southeast to the humid northwest. The flat area with small slope is more edge-fragmented than the steep area since the ED decreases as the slope increases.

Ten sampling quadrates and were randomly laid for overstorey (OS), understorey (US) and ground vegetation (GS), respectively. Girth of trees was measured at breast height and collar diameters of shrubs and herbs at height. Biomass was estimated using allometric regression equations and herb biomass by harvesting. Net primary productivity (NPP) was determined by summing biomass increment and litter crop values. Aspect and slope influenced the vegetation types, biomass and NPP in different forests. Standing biomass and NPP varied from 18.6 to and 5.3 to respectively, in different forest types. The highest biomass was found in dense mixed forest, while net production recoded in Teak forests. Both were lowest in degraded mixed forests of different forest types. OS, US and GS contributed 90.4, 8.7 and 0.7%, respectively, for the total mean standing biomass in different forests.

The availability of datasets from the system research and predictability experiment initiated a forecast data archive, called THORPEX interactive grand global ensemble (TIGGE), makes it possible to use forecasts from a suite of individual ensemble prediction systems (member models) and to construct multi-model superensemble forecasts that are designed to remove the collective bias errors of the suite of models. Precipitation datasets are important for this study, we have used high resolution daily gridded rainfall dataset of India Meteorological Department (IMD), in addition to rainfall estimates from tropical rainfall microwave mission (TRMM) satellite and the CPC morphing technique (CMORPH). The scientific approach of this study entails the use of a multi-model superensemble for forecast and to verify against the rainfall information during a training phase, as well as during a forecast phase. We examine the results of forecasts out to day-10 and ask how well do forecast strings of day-1 through day-10 handle the prediction of the onset and duration of the breaks in the summer monsoon rains. Our results confirm that it is possible to predict the onset of a dry spell, around week in advance from the use of the multi-model superensemble and a suite of TIGGE models. We also examine trajectories of the parcels arriving in India in such forecasts from member models and from the multi-model superensemble to validate the arrival of descending dry desert air from the Arabian region during the dry spells and its mode of transition from wet spell. Some phenological features such as a shift in the latitude of the tropical easterly jet and changes in its intensity during break periods are additional observed features that are validated from the history of multi-model superensemble forecasts. Invariably this multi-model superensemble performs better than any single model in proving the better forecasts during our experiment period.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Belgaum city is a developmental hub of Karnataka State in India. In the recent time, the Government of Karnataka has planned to set up many processing industries in the vicinity of Belgaum to meet the growing needs of the region and to ease out the pressure on the already existing industrial hubs in Karnataka State. Ghataprabha, a tributary of river Krishna, is one of the major sources of water supply to Belgaum city and adjoining areas. During the last decade, a lot of anthropogenic activities such as unplanned agricultural activities are ongoing in many parts of the catchment. Therefore, people of Belgaum are more concerned about the quality of water in Ghataprabha river. Considering the significance of water quality of the river, surface water samples were collected during Pre- and Post-monsoon season from selected locations and analyzed for both physical and chemical constituents in the laboratory. The results indicate that the chemical parameters such as bicarbonates, sulphates, chlorides, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium are within the permissible limits. QUAL2E model was applied to assess the impact of point and non-point sources of pollution on the river water quality. Results show that the water quality conditions are highly acceptable all along the river stretch. Further, the variation of with river discharge was also estimated.

Significant genotypic variability was observed for all morpho-agronomic traits studied. Dendrogram and principal component analysis based on morpho-agronomic traits separated the accessions into three clusters. The first two principal components accounted for 82% of the total variation. The most discriminatory traits were number of grains per panicle, biomass yield, and days to flowering and maturity. The SSR analysis revealed high polymorphic information content value of 0.84. Though, Mantel test did not show a significant correlation, yet the classification based on phenotyping and genotyping data showed good agreement for the expression of morpho-agronomic traits in the formation of clusters.

This disease is caused by urdbean leaf crinkle virus (ULCV). Urdbean (Vigna mungo L. Hepper) is relatively more susceptible than other pulses to leaf crinkle disease. Urdbean is an important and useful crop cultivated in various parts of South-East Asia and well adapted for cultivation under semi-arid and subtropical conditions. Aphids, insects and whiteflies have been reported as vectors of the disease. The virus is also transmitted through sap inoculation, grafting and seed. The loss in seed yield in ULCD-affected urdbean crop ranges from 35 to which is dependent upon type of genotype location and infection time. The diseased material and favourable climatic conditions contribute for the widespread viral disease. Anatomical and biochemical changes take place in the affected diseased plants. Genetic variations have been reported in the germplasm screening which suggest continuous screening of available varieties and new germplasm to search for new traits (new genes) and identify new sources of disease resistance. There are very few reports on breeding programmes for the development and release of varieties tolerant to ULCD. Mostly random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) as well as inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) molecular markers have been utilized for fingerprinting of blackgram, and a few reports are there on sequence-tagged micro-satellite site (STMS) markers. There are so many RNA viruses which have also developed strategies to counteract silencing process by encoding suppressor proteins that create hindrances in the process. But, in the case of ULCV, there is no report available indicating which defence pathway is operating for its resistance in the plants and whether same silencing suppression strategy is also followed by this virus causing leaf crinkle disease in urdbean. The antiviral principles (AVP) present in leaf extracts of several plants are known to inhibit infection by many viruses.

Parental care patterns and other forms of reproductive behavior, along with the reproductive strategy as a whole, can be the subject of semogenetic analysis to no less an extent than morphological structures sensu stricto. One highly specialized form of parental care in fish, including representatives of the suborder of labyrinth fishes and their sister groups, appears to be parental food provisioning. In our view, the evolutionary origin of postembryonic brood provisioning in bony fishes is characterized by three main features: (1) in fish, different forms of postembryonic food provisioning are convergent in their origin; (2) any kind of brood provisioning is realized through exploitation of the already existing character and is maintained by selection due to an enhancement of offspring fitness; (3) the main evolutionary path of the emergence and development of this phenomenon consists in function expansion and replacement. The hypothesis does have heuristic power, since it enables prediction of the presence of the reproductive strategy component in question through the identification of adequate basic adaptations. Although parental care occurs in the majority of anabantoid fishes, there are still several species for which such care is not known. On the cladogram, these species by no means take the basal position but are surrounded by fishes that provide care for their eggs, or even their hatchlings. The parsimony principle leads to the suggestion that parental care is a plesiomorphic character in the suborder Anabantoidei (or in the order Anabantiformes). It seems that the ancestors of present day noncarrying species that take various positions within this phylogenetic group were fishes showing parental care. Their reproductive strategy later changed as a result of r selection. If this hypothesis is correct, the absence of parental care should be considered a case of reproductive strategy degradation. It is quite probable that parental food provisioning was a component of the ancestral reproductive strategies. It is also possible that the reproductive strategy of present-day anabantoids that supposedly do not care for their offspring actually includes some optional forms of parental care.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'This paper looks at the crucial issue of dry-season groundwater-availability in the state of Maharashtra, India. We look at the two key hydro-climatological measurements which are used to implement groundwater policy in the state, viz., water levels in 5000 + observation wells across the state and aggregate rainfall data. We see that there is substantial variation in groundwater levels within and across the years in most wells. We argue that for a large number of these observation well locations, aggregate rainfall data is inadequate to model or to predict groundwater levels. For this, we use a novel random rainfall coefficient model for the purpose of modelling the effect of rainfall in a composite setting where extraction and changing land-use data is unknown. The observed high variance of this coefficient points to significant variations in groundwater levels, which may only be explained by unmeasured anthropogenic factors. Next, we see that the uncertainty in actual groundwater levels along with scarcity are two distinct features of groundwater availability and will elicit different behaviours from the typical user. Finally, we recommend that quantitative groundwater assessment protocols of the state should move to incorporating data from which extraction and land-use may be modelled. We believe this is one of the first studies where large spatio-temporal scale data gathered by state agencies have been analysed for scientific adequacy.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The performance of 11 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Climate Center (APCC) global climate models (coupled and uncoupled both) in simulating the seasonal summer monsoon rainfall variability over Asia (especially over India and East Asia) has been evaluated in detail using hind-cast data advance) generated from APCC which provides the regional climate information product services based on multi-model ensemble dynamical seasonal prediction systems.

The analysis found a large variation in spatial ASMR simulated with uncoupled model compared to coupled models (like Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia, National Centers for Environmental Prediction and Japan Meteorological Agency). The simulated ASMR in coupled model was closer to Climate Prediction Centre Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) compared to uncoupled models although the amount of ASMR was underestimated in both models. Analysis also found a high spread in simulated ASMR among the ensemble members (suggesting that the performance is highly dependent on its initial conditions). The correlation analysis between sea surface temperature (SST) and ASMR shows that that the coupled models are strongly associated with ASMR compared to the uncoupled models (suggesting that air-sea interaction is well cared in coupled models). The analysis of rainfall using various statistical measures suggests that the multi-model ensemble (MME) performed better compared to individual model and also separate study indicate that Indian and East Asian land masses are more useful compared to Asia monsoon rainfall as a whole. The results of various statistical measures like skill of multi-model ensemble, large spread among the ensemble members of individual model, strong teleconnection (correlation analysis) with SST, coefficient of variation, inter-annual variability, analysis of Taylor diagram, etc. suggest that there is a need to improve coupled model instead of uncoupled model for the development of a better dynamical seasonal forecast system.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Mountain ecosystem, on the earth, has plenty of natural resources.

The CSM reproduces the seasonal cycle as well as basic observed patterns of key climatic parameters reasonably well in spite of some limitations in simulation of the monsoon rainfall. However, while the seasonality in rainfall over the region is simulated well, the simulated area-averaged monsoon rainfall is underestimated to only about 60% of the observed rainfall. The centers of maxima in simulated monsoon rainfall are slightly displaced southward as compared to the climatological patterns. The cross-equatorial flow in simulated surface wind patterns during summer is also stronger than observed with an easterly bias. The transient experiment with a 1% per year compound increase in CO2 with CSM suggests an annual mean area-averaged surface warming of about over the region at the time of CO2 doubling. This warming is more pronounced in winter than during the monsoon season. A net increase in area-averaged monsoon rainfall of about largely due to increased moisture convergence and associated convective activity over the land, is obtained. The enhanced intraseasonal variability in the monsoon rainfall in a warmer atmosphere is confined to the early part of the monsoon season which the summer monsoon activity over India could also contribute to more intense rainfall spells over the land regions of the Indian subcontinent, thus increasing the probability of extreme rainfall events in a warmer atmosphere.'\"], [\"legumes and non-legumes'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Litter decomposition and nitrogen mineralization were investigated in subtropical plantation forests in southern China.

Split application of fertilizer suggested for increasing nitrogen-use efficiency is often not practical in rainfed lowland rice due to adverse situations. Hence, the entire required amount of N has to be applied in one single application when the water regime is favorable. A single broadcast application, however, increases N loss. Deep placement of urea supergranules (USG) has been proven to improve N fertilizer efficiency. The placement technology is best suited to conditions where the predominant N loss mechanism is ammonia volatilization rather than leaching or denitrification. Deep placement of USG thus has greater benefit over surface split application on soils with moderate to heavy texture, low permeability and percolation rate, and high cation exchange capacity and pH. Environments and management factors conducive to high ammonia volatilization potential would benefit most from deep-placement technology. Improved N recovery and efficiency of USG has been well-documented for lowland rice, but its market availability and methods to achieve placement pose problems. The technology has very limited adoption because USG is not commercially available or manufactured in most countries, and labor requirement is high with hand placement. Manual application creates more difficulties in handling the granules, besides taking more hours per hectare, than 2 split broadcast applications of prilled urea. Applicators developed so far have not worked satisfactorily under standing water conditions and in direct-seeded rice conditions due to hardness of the soil. Hence, it is necessary to develop a suitable applicator to overcome these difficulties. Alternatively, for direct-seeded rice, N-fertilizers can be subsoil-banded near seedrows. The placement technology, if adopted by the farmers of the potential lowland areas in eastern India, is expected to give an additional production of 5.6 million tons of rice.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater and its suitability for drinking water supply in Kangayam taluk, Tirupur district, Tamil Nadu, India.

Natural and human impact on soil carbon concentration and storage is poorly understood in native north Australian savanna, yet this represents the largest carbon store in the ecosystem. To gain understanding of possible management impacts on this carbon pool, soil organic carbon (SOC) of the top 1m of red earth sands and sandy loams common in the region was sampled at 5 sites with different vegetation cover and site history (fire regime and tree removal). SOC was high when compared to other published values for savannas and was more comparable with dry-deciduous tropical forests. Sites sampled in this study represent high rainfall savannas of northern Australia (> annual rainfall) that feature frequent burning (2 in or more frequent) and a cycle of annual re-growth of tall C4 grasses that dominate the savanna understorey. These factors may be responsible for the higher than expected SOC levels of the surface soils, despite high respiration rates. Medium term fire exclusion at one of the sampled sites (Wildlife Park) dramatically reduced the grassy biomass of the understorey. This site had lower SOC levels when compared to the grass dominated and frequently burnt sites, which may be due to a reduction in detrital input to surface soil carbon pools. Exclusion of trees also had a significant impact on both the total amount and distribution of soil organic carbon, with tree removal reducing observed SOC at depth Soil carbon content was higher in the wet season than that in the dry season, but this difference was not statistically significant. Our results indicated that annual cycle of grass growth and wildfire resulted in small carbon accumulation in the upper region of the soil, and removal of woody plants resulted in significant carbon losses to recalcitrant, deep soil horizons greater than depth.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'At an elephant camp in central Myanmar (Burma), we interviewed mahouts and veterinarians to describe the diet of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in a mixed-deciduous forest. Elephants showed a broad dietary breadth (103 plant species from 42 families); consumed mostly browse (94% of plant species); and were very selective about plant parts [e.g., many trees were eaten exclusively for their bark (22%) or fruits (14%)]. The fruits from 29 plant species were recorded to be eaten by elephants. Several of these were found as fruit remains, seeds, or seedlings in elephant dung, suggesting a role of Asian elephants in seed dispersal. Work elephants and their mahouts prove to be a rich source of information to understand wild elephant ecology.'\"], [\"expression profiles'\"], [\"Abstract: 'A rapid in vitro propagation protocol for large-scale cultivation of Lagerstroemia speciosa L., an important medicinal and ornamental tree was established using nodal explants in Schenk and Hildebrandt (SH) medium optimized with various concentration and combinations of auxins and cytokinins. The study revealed, for the first time, accumulation of corosolic acid (CRA), an anti-diabetic and anti-obese pentacyclic triterpene in the in vitro plantlets. Multiple shoot induction was maximum in SH medium supplemented with Benzyl Amino Purine (BAP) and shoot initials, when transferred to SH medium supplemented with BAP, resulted in shoot multiplication and elongation. Rooted plantlets, after of hardening in mist-house and of rearing under shade-net, transferred to forest segments showed successful establishment In a short duration of ~2,450 hardened plantlets were obtained from a single nodal explant. The ISSR banding profiles of the regenerants and the mother plant were highly monomorphic and similarity matrix confirmed genetic fidelity of the clones. Chemical analysis using HPLC showed that CRA content is more in mature DW) than young leaves DW) of the in vitro derived plantlets. The differential synthesis of CRA in micropropagated and mother plant was studied using gene expression profiles. The expression of upstream rate limiting genes in terpenoid biosynthesis was relatively high in young leaves while downstream Cytochrome P450 hydroxylase (CYP450H), catalyzing the final step(s) in CRA synthesis, was more in mature leaf, suggesting a strong correlation between observed CRA variation and gene expression. The study signifies the role of in vitro methodology for true-to-type regeneration and its possible utility for biosynthesis of CRA, throughout the year.'\"], [\"Abstract: '60% of the ecosystems are not used in a sustainable way. Modern agriculture is blamed for declining soil carbon and biodiversity. Climate change, habitat fragmentation and other obstacles impede the movement of many animal species, and distribution changes are projected to continue. Therefore, we need alternative management strategies. The colony organisation of social insects, especially of ants, is seen as a model to design an improved agricultural management, because ants are very experienced agriculturists. Ants represent half of the global insect biomass. Their individuals work like a super organism. This article focuses on harvester and leaf cutter ants by considering Lasius species. It reviews the organisation structure of social ant communities. Harvester and leaf cutter ants represent a high percentage of the worldwide ant societies. They collect plant saps with carbon nitrogen (C/N) ratios of about 40 for their own nourishment and leaf fragments with C/N ratios of about 100 for fungi gardens and brood nourishment. They sustain huge numbers of individuals with their low N-based organic imports and their colony commensalisms enable them to convert these polymers into lower molecular, partly volatile compounds, adenosinetriphosphate (ATP), and heat. Digging improves water infiltration, drainage and soil aeration. Ants maintain fungi as a food source for the scleroproteinous brood, carry out food preservation, infection control and waste management, and construct with endurance new nests and rebuild them after damage. All these activities move the nest sites far away from the thermodynamic equilibrium. Physical, chemical and biological gradients emerge and the growing populations, together with nest-penetrating mycorrhized plant roots, absorb the released nutrients and form biomass by lowering energy flows into potentially strong consumer-resource interactions or runaway consumptions. The plant material import of leaf cutter ants, rich in carbon but low in proteins, amounts to kg dry weight per year. It keeps the electron donor/acceptor ratio in favour of the electron donor so that denitrifiers can reduce nitrate predominantly to N2. Ants living in highly N-polluted areas bind the pollutant in the cuticle. In their low N-input environments harvester, leaf cutter and honeydew-sucking ants furnish the N demand of adult ants with the help of N2-fixing bacteria. The low N-input management of harvester, leaf cutter and honeydew-sucking ants is therefore a resourceful concept for approaching a highly productive agriculture by avoiding soil carbon decline and N2O emissions increase.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Wild edibles continue to be a significant contributor to the global food basket in much of the developing world.

Increasing irrigation and domestic water use, change in the local climate and changes in the surrounding land cover are believed to be the causes of Lake demise. Expansion of major irrigated crops in particular chat (Catha Edulis), potato and vegetables and non-judicious use of irrigation water in the Lake Alemaya watershed led to presumption that irrigation is partly responsible for the withdrawal of large quantity of water from the lake. Thus, water balance study of Lake Alemaya was carried out under presumed scenarios in order to study the possible trends and fluctuations of the lake water level in response to proposed scenarios. Further, it is essential to study the irrigation performance for developing optimal irrigation schedules in the study area to make the best use of available water for long term sustainability of the water resources of Lake Alemaya. It was identified that expansion of the irrigated area in general and chat cultivation in particular in the study area have been the key to sustainable management of lake water, hence its expansion during the past was studied through interpretation of satellite data. Subsequently, performance evaluation of the small-scale irrigation practices for major irrigated crops was carried out. Optimal irrigation schedules for different crop seasons were also developed for these irrigated crops using CROPWAT software. It was found that chat area increased from in 1996 to nearly in 2002. Further, it was observed that 43% surface area of the lake has reduced within a span of Overall, maximum irrigation intensity of chat, potato and vegetables is observed during the first irrigation season of the crop calendar. Particularly, in case of chat, irrigation performance indicators such as Relative Water Supply (RWS), Relative Irrigation Supply (RIS), Depleted Fraction (DF) and Overall Consumed Ratio (OCR) values indicated poor performance of irrigation practices. From the analysis, it was found that the application of a fixed irrigation depth and fixed irrigation interval combinations of or are recommended for chat in the study area. Optimal irrigation schedules were decided on the basis of combination of irrigation interval and depth that results in low loss of irrigation water with reasonable yield reduction. Thus, determination of appropriate water management strategy can ensure proper utilization of the available water resources and improve the water application efficiency of the small-scale irrigation practices around Lake Alemaya, Ethiopia.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Watershed characterization and prioritization is carried out before taking up the task of management. Morphometric analysis plays significant role in prioritization of watersheds for proper use and various economic activities like animal husbandry. In the present study, morphometric investigations are used to ascertain plant growth potential of watershed for environmental management. Analysis was carried out in four sub-watersheds of information system (GIS) technique for determining plant growth potential. The analysis includes linear aspects, aerial aspects and relief aspects. Exhaustive data requirements and individual biasness for assigning weights to various morphometric parameters affect the prioritization process. Thus, Weighted Sum Analysis (WSA) method is used in the present study for identifying for potential plant growth. The maximum elevation in Shivganga watershed is in sub-watershed which increases stream flow velocity, erosion, minimized length of overland flow and quick water flow into streams contributing to hydrograph rise. It has been observed that sub-watershed 3 and 4 with low average slope show significant plant growth and contribute less runoff, relatively less land erosion and low peaks in hydrograph. The SW3 has highest potential for plant growth as it matches with the lowest weighted sum analysis. Thus, SW1 is given rank 1 with least compound factor value 1.317. The result illustrated that 13.64 to 45.40% of total area, falls in the good potential growth zone. The results of the work may be useful for watershed administrators and managers while planning conservation measures in the area.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Tropical and subtropical hilly vegetation in Himalayan regions are well suited for the taxonomical research because of the diverse habitat available in close proximity and the regions promote high species richness and endemism due to variation in slopes, soils, rocks, microclimate, exposure, latitude and altitude. Pteridophytes have evolved to fill the ecological niche between the angiosperms and the gymnosperms. During the course of recent study towards the pteridophytes of Nokrek Biosphere Reserve in eastern Himalaya, a few new taxa are described and geographical distribution extension of several previously reported species have also come to light. Studies based mainly on collections made during the last years have resulted in the revised description of the 19 species of lycophyta and ferns viz.

Over people depend on climate-sensitive sectors, such as rain-fed agriculture and forestry, for livelihood and over 973 million people are exposed to vector borne malarial parasites. Projection of climatic factors indicates a wider exposure to malaria for the Indian population in the future. If precautionary measures are not taken and development processes are not managed properly some developmental activities, such as hydro-electric dams and irrigation canal systems, may also exacerbate breeding grounds for malaria. This article integrates climate change and developmental variables in articulating a framework for integrated impact assessment and adaptation responses, with malaria incidence in India as a case study. The climate change variables include temperature, rainfall, humidity, extreme events, and other secondary variables. Development variables are income levels, institutional mechanisms to implement preventive measures, infrastructure development that could promote malarial breeding grounds, and other policies. The case study indicates that sustainable development variables may sometimes reduce the adverse impacts on the system due to climate change alone, while it may sometimes also exacerbate these impacts if the development variables are not managed well and therefore they produce a negative impact on the system. The study concludes that well crafted and well managed developmental policies could result in enhanced resilience of communities and systems, and lower health impacts due to climate change.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'We examined the effects of treefall gap size and soil properties on microbial biomass dynamics in an undisturbed mature-phase humid subtropical broadleaved forest in north-east India. Canopy gaps had low soil moisture and low microbial biomass suggesting that belowground dynamics accompanied changes in light resources after canopy opening. High rainfall in the region causes excessive erosion/leaching of top soil and eventually soil fertility declines in treefall gaps compared to understorey. Soil microbial population was less during periods when temperature and moisture conditions are low, while it peaked during rainy season when the litter decomposition rate is at its peak on the forest floor. Greater demand for nutrients by plants during rainy season (the peak vegetative growth period) limited the availability of nutrients to soil microbes and, therefore, low microbial C, N and P. Weak correlations were also obtained for the relationships between microbial C, N and P and soil properties. Gap size did influence the microbial nutrients and their contribution to soil organic carbon, total Kjeldhal nitrogen and available-P. Contribution of microbial C to soil organic carbon, microbial N to total nitrogen were similar in both treefall gaps and understorey plots, while the contribution of microbial P to soil available-P was lower in gap compared to the understorey. These results indicate that any fluctuation in microbial biomass related nutrient cycling processes in conjunction with the associated microclimate variation may affect the pattern of regeneration of tree seedlings in the gaps and hence be related with their size.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The paper deals with the hydrochemical characterization and water quality assessment of springs emerging from the Archaean crystalline basements at the foothills of Western Ghat mountains in the highlands and Neogene sedimentary formations in the coastal lowlands of Kerala in south west India. A total of 19 springs from two important river basins of southern Kerala such as Ithikkara and Kallada river basins were studied for 18 physico-chemical (temperature, pH, electrical total dissolved dissolved total hardness (TH), Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, CO3 HCO3 SO4 , NO3 Fe2+, and ) as well as bacteriological parameters. The discharge computations show that free-falling type of springs in the area discharge about 256.23 million liters of water a year. A comparative study between the spring water samples of highland and lowland regions reveal that the quality of spring water, except pH and bacteriological contents, satisfies the standards set by the Bureau of Indian Standards and World Health Organization for drinking water. Spring water samples collected from the lowlands register high value of Na+ and compared with the highlands. Bicarbonate, Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ values are high in highland than lowland springs. The present study reveals that the spring water sources in the region can be developed as an alternate source for drinking water, provided pH correction and proper disinfection are done prior to its end use.'\"], [\"behaviour of the pest as possible causes'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Hyposidra talaca (Walk.) is a major pest of tea (Camellia sinensis L.) in Northeastern (NE) India. The present study examined (1) the likely causes of expansion of H. talaca to tea from its ancestral home of sal forests, and (2) the anti-predatory mechanisms that helped it to build up in tea plantations. Studies were made on the role of the regulating agents of the eggs and caterpillars of the pest and responses of caterpillars to different predator-like stimuli (predatory wasps, ants and birds) and mechanical vibrations. Eggs collected from the fields were reared in the laboratory to study egg parasitization and monitored in the field to study the role of natural predators. Prolonged drought and inconsistent rainfall influenced the range expansion of H. talaca. In tea plantations, female moths preferred to conceal the eggs in the scaly bark of shade trees. Excluding woodpeckers, H. talaca eggs were scarcely attacked by other natural enemies. The caterpillars dropped off the plant in response to potential predators and assumed a deimatic or shape, and remained motionless when stimulated by mechanical vibration. This study suggests that the lack of specialized natural enemies helped H. talaca to build up in the tea plantations of NE India in a short period of time.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Dynamics of heavy metals such as Fe, Mn, Zn, Cr, Cu, Co, Ni, Pb, and Cd in surface water of Mahanadi River estuarine systems were studied taking 31 different stations and three different seasons. This study demonstrates that the elemental concentrations are extremely variable and most of them are higher than the World river average. Among the heavy metals, iron is present at highest concentration while cadmium is at the least. The spatial pattern of heavy metals suggests that their anthropogenic sources are possibly from two major fertilizer plants and municipal sewage from three major towns as well as agricultural runoff. The temporal variations for metals like Fe, Cu, and Pb exhibit higher values during the monsoon season, which are related to agricultural runoff. Concentrations of Ni, Pb, and Cd exceed the maximum permissible limits of surface water quality in some polluted stations and pose health risks. Dissolved heavy metals like Fe, Mn, Cr, Ni, and Pb exhibit a non-conservative behavior during estuarine mixing, while Zn, Cu, and Co distribution is conservative. Distribution of cadmium in the estuarine region indicates some mobilization which may be due to desorption. The enrichment ratio data suggest that various industrial wastes and municipal wastes contribute most of the dissolved metals in the Mahanadi River.

Genetic fidelity of in vitro raised 40 plants of Ocimum basilicum L. derived from nodal explants was assessed by 56 RAPD and 17 ISSR markers, for their genetic stability. Out of 56 RAPD and 17 ISSR primers screened, only 31 RAPD and 11 ISSR primers produced clear, reproducible, and scorable bands. The 31 RAPD primers produced 92 distinct and scorable loci, with an average of 2.96 loci per primer. The number of scorable loci for ISSR primers varied from three (ISSR-BG09 and ISSR-BG11) to eight (ISSR-BG01), with an average of 4.81 loci per primer. The number of loci generated per primer was greater in ISSR than RAPD. The markers designed from AG motif amplified more number of loci. The markers anchored at ends produced a higher number of consistent bands than unanchored markers. All banding profiles from micropropagated plants were monomorphic and similar to those of the mother plant. A similarity matrix based on coefficient revealed that the pair-wise value between the mother and the in vitro-raised plantlets was 1, indicating 100% similarity.

Worldwide, these ecologically important forests have degraded considerably since the past few decades due to such factors. These factors have harmful consequences on the vegetation structure and diversity especially tree seedlings, which may further aggravate climate change. Generally, the vegetation recovery is very slow and unpredictable in the dry tropics due to complex interaction among tree seedling, site (particularly, soil) and climatic conditions. We inculcated that a better understanding of the behavior of individuals of different tree species at seedling stage in dry forests is of immense importance. It is increasingly being recognized for explaining and managing the future composition of plant communities under changing environmental conditions. In this regard, the multi-factorial interaction studies under various combinations are needed in dry tropical ecosystems to understand the: (1) impact of relative variability in resources and disturbances on the responses of tree seedlings of native species and (2) how the later relates to distinct functional and life history traits of the individual tree species. Most importantly, such studies would improve our limited understanding of how variation (natural and man-made) in nutrient availability, under the influence of other local environmental factors (such as water, light, grass competition, herbivory, fire, allelopathy and enhanced CO2 conditions), would affect the dynamics of dry tropical forest community. It may help in the proper management of these forests. Moreover, it may prove helpful in the current climate change scenario, as change in forest community dynamics may have consequences on soil C sequestration and CO2 efflux at global scale.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Agricultural drought has been a recurrent phenomenon in many parts of India. Remote sensing plays a vital role in real time monitoring of the agricultural drought conditions over large area, there by effectively supplementing the ground mechanism. Conventional drought monitoring is based on subjective data. The satellite based monitoring such as National Agricultural Drought Assessment and Monitoring System (NADAMS) is based on the crop condition, which is an integrated effect of soil, effective rainfall, weather, etc. Drought causes changes in the external appearance of vegetation, which can clearly be identified (by their changed spectral response) and judged using satellite sensors through the use of vegetation indices. These indices are functions of rate of growth of the plants and are sensitive to the changes of moisture stress in vegetation. The satellite based drought assessment methodology was developed based on relationship obtained between previous Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) profiles with corresponding agricultural performance available at district/block level. Palar basin, one of the major river basins in Tamil Nadu state was selected as the study area. The basin covers 3 districts, which contain 44 blocks.

Groundwater samples were collected and analysed to obtain the hydrochemical characteristics for delineating the groundwater recharge and discharge zones. Alkaline water is present in the district during all seasons. Groundwater facies were evaluated and the majority of them were CaHCO3 and types. Generally, HCO3 was used to identify the recharge area and Cl the discharge area. Dominance of HCO3 in both water types helps in identifying the recharge zones. The TDS and major ions in conjunction with HCO3/Cl, SO4/HCO3, and Cl/T.anions were used in the delineation of areas. Results of geochemical modelling using PHREEQC were in agreement with the analysis of ionic ratios. Carbonate minerals are saturated in the recharge zone and become undersaturated as the flow progresses. HCO3 to Cl types for the recharge to discharge zones were confirmed by the aqueous speciation modelling. Gradual increase of NO3 along the flow path also supported the increasing anthropogenic influences towards the discharge zone. The spatial distribution diagrams drawn for each of these ratios suggested that a major part of the study area is covered by recharge zones. Mettupalayam and Pollachi taluks were found to be discharge zones. The results of the study showed that the water quality in the discharge zones is largely controlled by anthropogenic activities. The study gains importance since part of the water supply to the Coimbatore corporation area is from a source in the neighbouring state and the major surface water source of this area comes under an interstate water dispute.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Integrating targeted metabolic profiling with genetic diversity estimates is vital for selecting genetic stocks for breeding as well as mapping a biochemical trait.

To infer geohydrological makeup and consequent behavior of the KRB in respect of GW potential, firstly, various thematic layers viz. geomorphology, geology, slope, soil, lineament density and drainage density, were created. Secondly, thematic layers and their features were assigned suitable weights on the scale according to their relative significance for the presence and potential of GW. The assigned weights of the layers and their features were normalized using analytic network process method, and then the selected thematic maps were integrated in GIS using weighted overlay method to create the final groundwater prospect zone map. From the outcomes, the groundwater prospect zones of the KRB basin was found to be very good good moderate poor which constitute 24, 15, 26 and 35% of the study area, respectively. The GW prospect zone map was finally validated using geohydrology of area and GW level data from 43 phreatic wells in the study area.

Estimation of aboveground biomass was determined by harvest method and multiplied with density of tree species. The aboveground biomass was between and the carbon stock ranged from 9.13 to across forest stands. Aboveground biomass and carbon stock increased with the increase in tree girth. The rate of carbon sequestration varied from 1.4722 to among the dominant tree species in forest stands in tropical deciduous forest area. The rate of carbon sequestration depends on species composition, the density of large trees in different girth classes, and anthropogenic disturbances in the present forest ecosystem. Further work is required to identify tree species having the highest potential to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere, which could lead to recommendations for tree plantations in a degraded ecosystem.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The influence of anthropogenic loading on the distribution of soft bottom benthic organisms of a tropical estuary (Cochin backwaters) was examined.

Principal component analysis distinguished three zones in the estuary. The central zone (Z1) was characterized by organic enrichment, low species diversity, and increased number of pollution tolerant species. Long-term deterioration of the estuary is indicated by an increase in the nutrients and chlorophyll a levels by sixfold during the last few decades. Flow restrictions in the lower estuary have lead to a fourfold increase in sediment organic carbon over the period of three decades. The reduced benthic diversity followed by an invasion of opportunistic polychaetes (Capitella capitata), are indicative of a stress in the estuary.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'We mapped the forest cover of Khadimnagar National Park (KNP) of Sylhet Forest Division and estimated forest change over a period of 22 years using Landsat TM images and other GIS data. Supervised classification and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image classification approaches were applied to the images to produce three cover classes, viz. dense forest, medium dense forest, and bare land. The change map was produced by differencing classified imageries of 1988 and 2010 as before image and after image, respectively, in ERDAS IMAGINE. Error matrix and kappa statistics were used to assess the accuracy of the produced maps. Overall map accuracies resulting from supervised classification of 1988 and 2010 imageries were 84.6% (Kappa 0.75) and 87.5% (Kappa 0.80), respectively. Forest cover statistics resulting from supervised classification showed that dense forest and bare land declined from 526 ha (67%) to 417 ha (59%) and 105 ha (13%) to 8 ha (1%), respectively, whereas medium dense forest increased from 155 ha (20%) to 317 ha (40%). Forest cover change statistics derived from NDVI classification showed that dense forest declined from 525 ha (67%) to 421 ha (54%) while medium dense forest increased from 253 ha (32%) to 356 ha (45%). Both supervised and NDVI classification approaches showed similar trends of forest change, i.e. decrease of dense forest and increase of medium dense forest, which indicates dense forest has been converted to medium dense forest. Area of bare land was unchanged. Illicit felling, encroachment, and settlement near forests caused the dense forest decline while short and long rotation plantations raised in various years caused the increase in area of medium dense forest.

A wide variation in morpho-agronomic characters was identified from information and also from laboratory analyses. Multivariate analysis of the data produced four discrete groups, represented by trees from different agroecological zones and soil types. Characteristics such as weight; length; diameter; girth of fruits; number of bulbs per fruit; percentage of pulp; percentage of rachis (core); and percentage of rind (peel) were found to be poorly correlated with environmental factors indicating that these characters may be genetically controlled. Other characters, such as seed weight, bulb weight, and brix (%) were found to be affected by environmental and genetic factors. Isozyme analysis of 50 accessions confirmed results obtained from field studies of morpho-agronomic characters.

The effects may not be conspicuous in the case of very large rivers, but the ecosystems of smaller rivers or streams may be completely destroyed over a period of time. While restoration of the natural flow regime may not be possible, at present there is increased effort to implement restoration by regulating environmental flow. This study investigates the development of an environmental flow management model at an icon site in the small river basin of Bharathapuzha, west India. To determine optimal environmental flow regimes, a historic flow model based on data assimilated since 1978 indicated a satisfactory minimum flow depth for river ecosystem sustenance is a value also obtained from the hydraulic model; however, as three of the reservoirs were already operational at this time a flow depth of is considered a more viable estimate. Analysis of daily stream flow in indicated adequate flow regimes during the monsoons in but that sections of the river dried out in with alarming water quality conditions near the river mouth. Furthermore, the preferred minimum flow regime expressed by stakeholders of the region is a water depth of which exceeds of the flood discharge in July. Water could potentially be conserved for environmental flow purposes by (1) the de-siltation of existing reservoirs or (2) reducing water spillage in the transfer between river basins.

We chose four study plots for control, light, medium and heavy thinning treatment, and three sub-plots for buried bag studies at similar elevations in each treatment plot to measure the net N mineralization and nitrification rates in situ. The contents of soil inorganic N (ammonium and nitrate) were similar between treatments, but all varied with season, reaching maxima in September 2003 and 2004. The seasonal maximum net Nmin rates after four treatments were 0.182, 0.246, 0.303 and 0.560 in 2003, and 0.242, 0.258, 0.411 and 0.671 2004, respectively.

In this paper, segmentation, feature extraction and classification methods are done for elephant recognition. Thresholding based segmentation technique is used for image segmentation and k-NN classifier is used for object recognition based on the shape features of the segmented image. Infrared elephant images are considered for experimentation. The database created by us for this type of object recognition includes elephant, bear, horse, pig, tiger, and cow and lion images. The recognition rate is calculated for performance evaluation. However, implementing such algorithms on software consumes more time as image sizes and bit depths grow larger. Hence this paper aims at hardware implementation of elephant recognition to reduce the computational time. The proposed hardware is prototyped inVirtex-4 xc4vlx25 FPGA using Xilinx System Generator (XSG) tool. The hardware/software co-simulation feature allows the input and output to be displayed on Matlab window while the processing is done through FPGA. The results indicate that when the category is elephant and if the recognition status is recognition rate is 100%. If the category is not an elephant and if the recognition status is recognition rate is still 100% also indicates, the approach is successful in elephant recognition and the computation of segmentation algorithm and shape feature extraction (area, centroid, equivdiameter) in hardware reduces the computational time of elephant recognition by 89.65% as compared to software computation.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The middle Andaman Island populations of Momordica cochinchinensis are quite distinct from true M. cochinchinensis in some floral characters.

The drainage density of the basin is estimated as 2.54 and the lower-order streams mostly dominate the basin. The high basin relief indicates high runoff and sediment transport. The elongation ratio of the Chalakudi Basin is estimated as 0.48 and indicates that the shape of the basin is elongated. The development of stream segments in the basin area is more or less effected by rainfall. Relief ratio indicates that the discharge capability of watershed is very high and the groundwater potential is meagre.

Conversions to agriculture have mainly been occurred from grasslands and sparsely vegetated areas as large as 1,314.95 and respectively. Urban coverage doubled in this period as a result of of increase. Urban area increased in the second period from 2,920 to Conversions to agriculture occurred at high amounts.

A long control run of CCSM3 with constant forcing at every year has been done and the model climatology has been generated using of simulation. Atmospheric component of the model has been able to capture the large scale phenomena, however, regional monsoon variability not fully captured by the model simulation. A suitable modification in the flux coupler and the convective parameterization process in regional scale certainly improve the atmospheric part of the climate system. Another major component of the climate model is the representation of Land Surface Processes (LSP). A successful inclusion of LSP in climate model must address the issues related to the regional scale variation of the properties of LSP. A proper understanding of land surface processes is very crucial for climate simulations using numerical models. To understand the LSP-monsoon coupling, the offline Community Land Model (CLM), taken from CCSM3 land component, simulation forced with three hourly atmospheric boundary conditions have also been analyzed and compared with the CLM version of coupled CCSM mode. The distribution of surface heat flux in CCSM coupled mode shows some discrepancies compared to the offline CLM. Both the simulation results are compared with existing climatological features and assessment to improve CCSM3 for the regional climate change studies is made.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'During a 5-yr study of lion-tailed macaques in their natural habitat, we found that: 1) most births occurred from January to April (70%) and from September to December (19%), showing a bimodal pattern with a major and a minor birth peak; 2) the period of peaks remained the same over 5 yr; and 3) a similar pattern of birth peaks occurred both in groups in large forest complexes that had overlapping home ranges with other groups and in single groups that were isolated in forest fragments in the same region but with similar ecological conditions. The results suggest more of a birth seasonality than mere breeding synchronization in the wild lion-tailed macaques. We also analyzed data on births in captivity in European Zoos for 10 yr. We observed no seasonality or peaks in births, and the pattern was the same over the years. Data on rainfall suggest that resource availability in the wild habitat may not be uniform throughout the year; hence, ecological factors may play an important role in determination of birth patterns in the natural habitats of lion-tailed macaques.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker was used to assess diversity in germplasm collection of Mucuna species which has gained tremendous attention in the recent past due to its promising nutritional, agronomic and medicinal attributes. Twenty five accessions comprising five species, collected from seven states of India were evaluated with twelve AFLP primer combinations that generated a total of 1,612 fragments with an average of 134 fragments per primer combination. The values of polymorphic information content (PIC), marker index (MI) and the resolving power (Rp) demonstrated the utility of the primer combinations used in the present study for discriminating the Mucuna accessions. UPGMA and Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of the genotypic data revealed clustering of accessions as per phenetic and genetic relationships. The similarity coefficient values suggested good variability among the M. pruriens accessions indicating their utility in breeding programs.

A study was taken up to understand the seasonal changes of physical processes at the headland bound and compared with exposed beaches. The spatio-temporal morpho-sedimentary dynamics were carried out through beach profiles, sediment samples, and simulated wave climates across two complete annual cycle. The beach profile survey was carried out using RTK-GPS, wherein the GRADISTAT was used for analysing sediment samples. The seasonal wave climates were studied with the SWAN model coupled with WAVEWATCH III. Observation shows, the sediment environment at headland bound beach is strongly dominated by fine sand throughout the year, whereas the exposed beach is illustrated from fine to medium sand across seasonal scale. The seasonal change in beach morphology occurs considerably in the exposed beach than that compared to headland bound. Successively, the occurrence of shoreline retreat is shown maximum up to in at the exposed beach during the monsoon. Both the locations showed strong seasonal variation in the wave energy as well as direction, whereas the nearshore wave energy at exposed beach is comparatively high with an average of 8342 J/m2 than the headland bound due to less deviation in the wave propagation.

The framework emphasizes that given a certain situation where the livelihood context, resources and institutions remain favourable, livelihood strategies carried out by people could possibly lead to two different outcomes. One, the results of livelihood strategies will produce sustainable outcomes providing affected households respite from the impacts of livelihood loss. Two, there is a possibility that resulting outcomes may not be sufficient to reverse livelihood crisis and may not necessarily result in sustainable livelihood because of the complexities, uncertainties and multilevel drivers associated with it. This paper aims to evaluate both these possibilities through use of empirical data to clarify factors and conditions that may impede sustainable livelihood outcomes despite well planned strategies. It highlights that availability of more resources (or capitals) do not necessarily contribute to more robust livelihood strategies or outcomes. Using the case of small scale fishery-based livelihood system of Chilika Lagoon, Bay of Bengal in the East coast of India, this paper suggests that the relationship between livelihood shocks and stresses, capitals, institutions and livelihood strategies is circular and not linear.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Delta regions of the Cauvery River basin are one of the significant areas of rice production in India.

The refined horizontal and vertical grid of the atmospheric component, LMDZ, constitutes a major difference compared to the previous IPSL-CM4 version used for CMIP3. From imposed-SST (Sea Surface Temperature) and coupled numerical experiments, we systematically analyze the impact of the horizontal and vertical grid resolution on the simulated climate. The refinement of the horizontal grid results in a systematic reduction of major biases in the mean tropospheric structures and SST. The mid-latitude jets, located too close to the equator with the coarsest grids, move poleward. This robust feature, is accompanied by a drying at mid-latitudes and a reduction of cold biases in mid-latitudes relative to the equator. The model was also extended to the stratosphere by increasing the number of layers on the vertical from 19 to 39 (15 in the stratosphere) and adding relevant parameterizations. The 39-layer version captures the dominant modes of the stratospheric variability and exhibits stratospheric sudden warmings. Changing either the vertical or horizontal resolution modifies the global energy balance in imposed-SST simulations by typically several W/m2 which translates in the coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations into a different global-mean SST. The sensitivity is of about per when varying the horizontal grid. A re-tuning of model parameters was thus required to restore this energy balance in the imposed-SST simulations and reduce the biases in the simulated mean surface temperature and, to some extent, latitudinal SST variations in the coupled experiments for the modern climate. The tuning hardly compensates, however, for robust biases of the coupled model. Despite the wide range of grid configurations explored and their significant impact on the present-day climate, the climate sensitivity remains essentially unchanged.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'It is generally perceived that landscape patterns or textures in a given protected area are spatially stationary.

These predictions were tested with data from a wild population of lion-tailed macaques in the Anamalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Tamil Nadu (India). Group size and composition, births, and mortality were monitored from eight groups for one to six years. The rate of growth of groups, birth rate, and survival rate were examined in relation to group size. The rate of growth of a group was a decreasing function of group size. Birth rate was also a decreasing function of group size and the number of adult females in the group. The sample size for survival rate of adults was too small to test for their dependence on group size. Immature survival was independent of group size, but the analysis was based on a very small sample. It is possible that the nature of dependence of net growth rate, birth rate, and survival rate on group size could be different outside the range of group sizes on which the analysis was based. The stronger relationship between birth rate and group size in the lion-tailed macaque, in relation to other primates, might be the result of its low birth rate as well as the relatively low temporal variation in resources in the rain forest. Limited data available from other sites indicate that the observed relationship between birth rate and group size might be spatially stable.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'An optimized method was devised for asymbiotic seed germination, seedling development and field establishment of Eulophia nuda Lindl., an endangered orchid with tremendous therapeutic potentialities.

The city stood as the fourth most populous city in the world. Recent seismo-tectonic studies of this city highlighted the presence of active West coast fault and Chiplun fault beneath the Deccan basalt. In the present study, spatial variability of probabilistic seismic hazard for Mumbai region (latitudes of and longitudes of at a grid spacing of which includes Mumbai city, Suburban, part of Thane district and Navi Mumbai, in terms of ground motion parameters; peak horizontal acceleration and spectral acceleration at 1.0-s period for 2 and probability of exceedance in are generated. The epistemic uncertainty in hazard estimation is accounted by employing seven different ground motion prediction equations developed for worldwide shallow crustal intra-plate environments. Further, the seismic hazard results are deaggregated for Mumbai (latitude longitude to understand the relative contributions of earthquake sources in terms of magnitude and distance. The generated hazard maps are compared with the zoning specified by Indian seismic code (IS1893: Part 1 in Indian standard criteria for earthquake-resistant design of structures, Part provisions and buildings.

Further, past shoreline positions have been demarcated and future positions are estimated for 12 and The shoreline change rate has been estimated using statistical point rate, average of rates and linear cross-validated with correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error (RMSE) methods. Resultant changes from natural processes and human interventions have been inferred from the estimated values of the back-calculated errors. About of transects exhibit RMSE values, indicating better agreement between the estimated and satellite-based shoreline positions, and the transects closer to the cell boundaries exhibit uncertainties in shoreline change rate estimations. Based on the values of correlation coefficient and RMSE, the influence of natural processes and human interventions on shoreline changes have been calculated. The cells/transects dominated by natural processes record low RMSE values, whereas those influenced by human interventions show lower correlation coefficient and higher RMSE values.

There are several sources of fluoride in the environment and different pathways to enter in the drinking water resources, which is responsible for potential effect on human health. Presence of high concentration of fluoride ion in groundwater is a major issue and it makes the water unsuitable for drinking purpose. Availability of fluoride in groundwater indicates various geochemical processes and subsurface contamination of a particular area. Fluoride-bearing aquifers, geological factors, rate of weathering, ion-exchange reaction, residence time and leaching of subsurface contaminants are major responsible factors for availability of fluoride in groundwater. In India, several studies have reported that the groundwater of several states are contaminated with high fluoride. The undesirable level of fluoride in groundwater is one of the most natural groundwater quality problem, which affects large portion of arid and semiarid regions of India. Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and West Bengal are the relatively high-fluoride-contaminated states in India. Chronic ingestion of high doses of fluoride-rich water leads to fluorosis on human and animal. Over 66 million Indian populations are at risk due to excess fluoride-contaminated water. Therefore, groundwater contamination subject to undesirable level of fluoride needs urgent attention to understand the role of geochemistry, hydrogeology and climatic factors along with anthropogenic inputs in fluoride pollution.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Bacterial diversity of soil samples collected from different geographical regions of Himalayan mountains was studied through culturable (13 samples) and culture-independent approaches (5 samples based on abundance of diversity indices in each ecological niche). diversity index and total bacterial count ranged from to and to of soil, respectively.

All the strains were subjected to amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis and the representative isolates from each cluster were chosen for 16S rRNA gene sequence-based identification. Soil habitat in Himalayan foot hills was dominated by the genera Arthrobacter, Exiguobacterium, Bacillus, Cedecea, Erwinia, and Pseudomonas. Five 16S rRNA gene libraries from the selected five samples yielded 268 clones and were grouped into 53 phylotypes covering 25 genera including the genus of Ferribacterium, Rothia, and Wautersiella, which were reported for the first time in Himalayan tracks. Principal coordinates analysis indicates that all the clone libraries were clearly separated and found to be significantly different from each other.

Studies so far relied either on remote sensing-based spatial mapping of physical vulnerability or on certain socio-economic aspects with limited scope for upscaling or replication. The current study is an attempt to develop a holistic and robust framework to assess the vulnerability of coastal India at different levels. We propose and estimate cumulative vulnerability index (CVI) as a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, at the village level, using nationally comparable and credible datasets. The exposure index (EI) was determined at the village level by decomposing the spatial multi-hazard maps, while sensitivity (SI) and adaptive capacity indices (ACI) were estimated using 23 indicators, covering social and economic aspects. The indicators were identified through the literature review, expert consultations, opinion survey, and were further validated through statistical tests. The socio-economic vulnerability index (SEVI) was constructed as a function of sensitivity and adaptive capacity for planning grassroot-level interventions and adaptation strategies. The framework was piloted in Sindhudurg, a coastal district in Maharashtra, India. It comprises 317 villages, spread across three taluks viz., Devgad, Malvan and Vengurla. The villages in Sindhudurg were ranked based on this multi-criteria approach. Based on CVI values, 92 villages (30%) in Sindhudurg were identified as highly vulnerable. We propose a decision tool for identifying villages vulnerable to changing climate, based on their level of sensitivity and adaptive capacity in a two-dimensional matrix, thus aiding in planning location-specific interventions. Here, vulnerability indicators are classified and designated as (indicators with significantly high values and intervention priority) and (indicators with low-to-moderate values) at the village level. The framework provides for aggregation or decomposition of CVI and other sub-indices, in order to plan spatial contingency plans and enable swift action for climate adaptation.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'BMC Ecology showcases the winning entries from its second Ecology Image Competition.

Among amphibians, species richness is lower in plantations than in forests while among reptiles there is no significant difference. The abundance of reptiles increases in plantations. Three studies dealt with reptile assemblages in relation to structural complexity of plantation, which suggest that species richness and abundance is higher in complex plantations.

Detachment of soil particles by overland flow occurs when the shear stress at the surface overcomes the gravitational forces and cohesive forces on the particles. Deposition occurs when the sediment load is greater than the transport capacity. Beasley et (Trans ASAE 1980) transport equations for laminar and turbulent flow conditions are used to calculate the transport capacity. The model is capable of handling distributed information about land use, slope, soil and roughness. The model is applied to the Catsop watershed in the Netherlands and the Harsul watershed in India. Remotely sensed data has been used to extract land use/land cover map of the Harsul watershed, and other thematic maps are generated using the GIS.

Humid region showed a decreasing trend in initial value of RDI during the drought as compared to semiarid and arid regions and indicated possible climate change impact in these regions. Among all the indices, RDI was considered as an effective indicator because of implicit severity and high prediction matches with the actual drought years.

In all the compartments, the heavy metals dominated are zinc followed by iron. The major reason could be area mineralogy and lithogenic sources. Enormous quantity of metals like iron in estuarine sediment is a very natural incident due to the permanently reducing condition of organic substances. Contamination of cadmium, lead, and chromium was closely associated with anthropogenic origin. In addition, surrounding land use and atmospheric deposition could have been responsible for substantial pollution. The accumulation of heavy metals in fishes and aquatic plants is the result of time-dependent deposition in lentic ecosystems. Moreover, various potential risk assessment methods for heavy metals were discussed. This review concludes that natural phenomena dominate the accumulation of essential heavy metals in lentic ecosystems compared to anthropogenic sources. Amongst other recent reviews on heavy metals from other parts of the world, the present review is executed in such a way that it explains the presence of heavy metals not only in water environment, but also in the whole of the lentic system comprising sediment, fishes, and aquatic plants.'\"], [\"tissues'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Deep RNA-Seq profiling, a revolutionary method used for quantifying transcriptional levels, often includes non-specific transcripts from other co-existing organisms in spite of stringent protocols. Using the recently published walnut genome sequence as a filter, we present a broad analysis of the RNA-Seq derived transcriptome profiles obtained from twenty different tissues to extract the biodiversity and possible interactions in the walnut ecosystem in California. Since the residual nature of the transcripts being analyzed does not provide sufficient information to identify the exact strain, inferences made are constrained to the genus level. The presence of the pathogenic oomycete Phytophthora was detected in the root through the presence of a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Cryptococcus, the causal agent of cryptococcosis, was found in the catkins and vegetative buds, corroborating previous work indicating that the plant surface supported the sexual cycle of this human pathogen. The RNA-Seq profile revealed several species of the endophytic nitrogen fixing Actinobacteria. Another bacterial species implicated in aerobic biodegradation of methyl tert-butyl ether (Methylibium petroleiphilum) is also found in the root. RNA encoding proteins from the pea aphid were found in the leaves and vegetative buds, while a serine protease from mosquito with significant homology to a female reproductive tract protease from Drosophila mojavensis in the vegetative bud suggests egg-laying activities. The comprehensive analysis of RNA-seq data present also unraveled detailed, tissue-specific information of ~400 transcripts encoded by the largest family of resistance (R) genes (NBS-LRR), which possibly rationalizes the resistance of the specific walnut plant to the pathogens detected. Thus, we elucidate the biodiversity and possible interactions in several walnut (Juglans regia) tissues in California using deep RNA-Seq profiling.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'In this study, we investigated the genetic diversity and relationships in C. olitorius by analysing populations representing different distribution areas, and developed a hypothesis on the origin and spread of the species in the pantropics. We employed amplified fragment lengths polymorphism (AFLP) and morphometric analyses in a total of 101 C. olitorius accessions. Results of both data sets are mostly congruent. The molecular analysis indicated generally low genetic diversity within populations and the gene diversity (He) ranged from 0.0457 to 0.0955 with a mean of 0.0763. Qualitative traits, especially related to leaf morphology, branching habit and stipule color were the taxonomically most informative characters. The highest morphological variability occurred within African accessions, indicating that this species originally evolved in Africa. In both analyses, the Asian materials were nested within African populations, especially with those from North and East Africa. This indicates an African origin of the species and we hypothesise that dispersal occurred via the trade routes instead of natural migration along the coasts from western Africa to the Indian subcontinent. Both analyses revealed materials from Ethiopia to be quite distinct. The highest number of private bands percent polymorphism (29.29%), and gene diversity (0.0955) were also detected in wild accessions collected from Ethiopia, suggesting a long-term spatial isolation of C. olitorius populations in the country. Germplasm samples from this region could therefore be a useful source of genetic variation in jute breeding programs.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Sagar Lake is situated in the middle of the Sagar City in the Vindhyan terrain of Bundelkhand region of India at an elevation of above mean sea level.

(Sapindaceae), collected from Gujarat, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh states were estimated using three DNA fingerprinting methods viz., random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), directed amplification of minisatellite DNA (DAMD) and inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR). The cumulative data analysis carried out for all three markers showed polymorphism. The intra-population genetic diversity analysis revealed the highest values of genetic diversity (0.16), Shannon information index (0.24) and polymorphic loci among Bhavnagar (BH) population, whereas lowest values were found in Junagarh (JU) population. The maximum inter-population average genetic distance (0.20) was between Allahabad (AL) and JU populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed highest percentage of variation among individuals of populations followed by among populations and among regions. Principal coordinate analysis and UPGMA dendrogram revealed that genetic diversity was in congruence with the geographical diversity. The data strongly suggest that low genetic flow, geographic isolation and to some extent genetic drift are the major factors responsible for high genetic differentiation. Preservation of genetic diversity of S. trifoliatus is important, both to promote adaptability of the populations to changing environment as well as to preserve a large gene pool for future genetic improvement. The present study using RAPD, DAMD and ISSR profiles of S. trifoliatus provide the means of rapid characterization of accessions within the populations, and thus enable the selection of appropriate accessions for further utilization in conservation and prospection programs of this important plant genetic resource.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The systematic screening of plant species with the purpose of discovering new bioactive compounds is prerequisite for any bioprospecting study.

The current study proposes a framework for developing optimal irrigation schedules for rice crop (Oryza sativa) under water deficit conditions. The framework utilizes a rice crop growth simulation model to identify the critical periods of growth that are highly sensitive to the reduction in final crop yield, and a genetic algorithm based optimizer develops the optimal water allocations during the crop growing period. The model ORYZA2000, which is employed as the crop growth simulation model, is calibrated and validated using field experimental data prior to incorporating in the proposed framework. The proposed framework was applied to a real world case study of a command area in southern India, and it was found that significant improvement in total yield can be achieved by the model compared to other water saving irrigation methods.

Results indicate that the highest U concentration was found in granitic terrains of this region and about of the samples exceed the permissible limit for drinking water. Among different species of U in aqueous media, carbonate complexes [UO2(CO3) 2 ] are found to be dominant. Groundwater with higher U has higher pCO2 values, indicating weathering by bicarbonate ions resulting in preferential mobilization of U in groundwater. The major minerals uraninite and coffinite were found to be supersaturated and are likely to control the distribution of U in the study area.

The results of this study showed that there was no significant difference in the heartwood percentage and specific gravity among three girth classes. High shrinkage values from green to oven-dry condition in all the classes indicate that the timber is dimensionally unstable compared to teak. The static bending strength at LP, MOR and MOE, compression strength parallel to grain, compressive strength perpendicular to grain at limit of proportionality and surface hardness (side and end) were evaluated and compared among all the three girth classes.

The organophosphorus pesticides in the study area showed the order of enrichment as chlorpyrifos >malathion >methyl parathion. While studying the variations in pesticide concentrations seasonally, higher concentrations were observed during the premonsoon monsoon season, with the concentrations being lower than the detectable level. Sediment characteristics, such as pH, texture, organic carbon, moisture content, etc., had reflective effect on the degradation rates of pesticides.

We assessed vegetation distribution and density and, mineral N pool sizes, composition and transformations in a sulfidic coastal marsh in relation to distance from sulfur springs. We observed strong relationships between vegetation attributes (species and density) and mineral N status with greater total inorganic N, and denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) in sediment samples from areas populated by Crithmum maritimum (mid-way between S springs and sea shore) than in sediments from areas colonized by either Agropyron repens (closest to the S springs) or mangrove (Rhizophora mangleL., farthest from the springs). Our data also suggest close links between N cycling and reduction. The latter resulted in net release of NH4+ ranging from in the low density C. maritimum to in the high-density A. repens, during a 3-day incubation. We also tested for microbial adaptation to long-term high sulfide exposure by measuring DEA using the C2H2 block method (which has been found to be strongly affected by the presence of sulfide) and amendment of marsh sediment samples with NaMoO4 to suppress reduced S production. In sediments extracted from sites near the sulfur springs (A. repens and C. maritimum), the C2H2 blockage assay yielded similar results without and with NaMoO4 addition. However, in samples from a mangrove located further downstream from the springs, DEA was substantially lower (2.3 vs. sediment when production of reduced S was not inhibited by NaMoO4. These results suggest that denitrifying microbes in the high sulfide areas may have adapted to the presence of sulfide, allowing for high rates of N and S cycling to occur simultaneously in these marshes.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The response of decomposition of litter for the dominant tree species in disturbed (pine), rehabilitated (pine and broadleaf mixed) and mature (monsoon evergreen broadleaf) forests in subtropical China to simulated N deposition was studied to address the following hypothesis: (1) litter decomposition is faster in mature forest (high soil N availability) than in rehabilitated/disturbed forests (low soil N availability); (2) litter decomposition is stimulated by N addition in rehabilitated and disturbed forests due to their low soil N availability; (3) N addition has little effect on litter decomposition in mature forest due to its high soil N availability. The litterbag method (a total of 2880 litterbags) and N treatments: Control-no N addition, Low-N: Medium-N: and High-N: were employed to evaluate decomposition. Results indicated that mature forest, which has likely been N saturated due to both long-term high N deposition in the region and the age of the ecosystem, had the highest litter decomposition rate, and exhibited no significant positive and even some negative response to nitrogen additions. However, both disturbed and rehabilitated forests, which are still N limited due to previous land use history, exhibited slower litter decomposition rates with significant positive effects from nitrogen additions. These results suggest that litter decomposition and its responses to N addition in subtropical forests of China vary depending on the nitrogen status of the ecosystem.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus has a long-standing history of bacterial-plant interrelationship as a symbiotic endophyte capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen.

The dioecious nature together with disproportionate distribution of male and female sex organs has been the major constraint in the development of an effective breeding programme for the plant. Early identification of the male and female genotypes at the seedling stage is a pre-requisite to ensure genetic improvement of C. guruba. In the present study, we used 30 inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers to develop a sequence-tagged site (STS) linked to male sex in C. guruba. Molecular analysis of bulked DNA pooled from male and female genotypes resulted in the isolation of a putative male-specific marker CgMSM. Partial sequencing of CgMSM resulted in an STS marker CgMY1 which could successfully amplify a 597-bp fragment in male but not in the female plants. DNA gel blot analysis confirmed it as a single-copy locus in the male genome of C. guruba. Further validation of CgMY1 in the natural population of C. guruba resulted in precise detection of 9 males and 6 females from 15 individuals with unknown sex. Therefore, the STS marker CgMY1 could be used as a proficient tool for early sex differentiation and form the basis of a sustainable breeding programme for genetic improvement of C. guruba.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'This study addresses the issues of spatial distribution, dispersal, and genetic heterogeneity in social groups of the cellular slime molds (CSMs).

Because the social phase involves division of labor with what appears to be an extreme form of the CSMs raise interesting evolutionary questions regarding the origin and maintenance of sociality. Knowledge of the genetic structure of social groups in the wild is necessary for answering these questions. We confirm that CSMs are widespread in undisturbed forest soil from South India. They are dispersed over long distances via the dung of a variety of large mammals. Consistent with this mode of dispersal, most social groups in the two species examined for detailed study, Dictyostelium giganteum and Dictyostelium purpureum, are multi-clonal.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'The hilly terrains of Himalaya are among the most vulnerable of the regions of India due to natural hazards. Different kinds of landslides occur frequently in the tectonically and geodynamically active region of Himalaya. Transportation, public networks, and all kinds of socioeconomic activities that occur in the high hills of the Lesser Himalaya are entirely dependent upon the local road and highway network in this region. However, the stability of the slopes that have been cut to construct and/or widen roads and highways is a major concern in hilly regions. Unplanned excavations performed by blasting have resulted in these cut slopes that are on the verge of instability. Such slopes become vulnerable under the influence of factors such as heavy rainfall, seismic activity, dynamic loading, and/or various kinds of human intervention. Any kind of slope failure can lead to disruption of traffic, losses of property and lives, injuries, as well as environmental degradation. In the present study, a slope stability analysis was performed of road-cut slopes along about of NH-109 from Rudraprayag to Agastmuni in the state of Uttarakhand in India. Based on field observations and variations in geological and geotechnical conditions, five locations were chosen for detailed study, including a laboratory study and numerical analysis. The two-dimensional conventional limit equilibrium method and a numerical technique based on the finite element method were used to analyze the cut slopes. This comparative analysis of slope stability provided a deeper understanding of this issue.

In India, several vulnerability assessment tools have been designed spanning multiple disciplines, by multiple actors, and at multiple scales. However, their conceptual, methodological, and disciplinary underpinnings, and resulting implications on who is identified as vulnerable, have not been interrogated. Addressing this gap, we systematically review peer-reviewed publications and grey literature to characterise how vulnerability to climate change is assessed in India. We frame our enquiry against four questions: (1) How is vulnerability conceptualised (vulnerability of whom/what, vulnerability to what), (2) who assesses vulnerability, (3) how is vulnerability assessed (methodology, scale), and (4) what are the implications of methodology on outcomes of the assessment. Our findings emphasise that methods to assess vulnerability to climate change are embedded in the disciplinary traditions, methodological approaches, and often-unstated motivations of those designing the assessment. Further, while most assessments acknowledge the importance of scalar and temporal aspects of vulnerability, we find few examples of it being integrated in methodology. Such methodological myopia potentially overlooks how social differentiation, ecological shifts, and institutional dynamics construct and perpetuate vulnerability. Finally, we synthesise the strengths and weaknesses of current vulnerability assessment methods in India and identify a predominance of research in rural landscapes with a relatively lower coverage in urban and peri-urban settlements, which are key interfaces of transitions.'\"], ['Abstract: \"The relationship between EUF extractable nutrients and conventional soil test extractable nutrients in the acid soils of Southern India on one hand and that between EUF values and tea productivity on the other are described.

The thickness of the weathered zone ranges from 10 to 40 m and the depth to bedrock ranges from 50 to 55 m. The groundwater is generally potable. The average annual rainfall during the twelve-year period is 590 mm. Out of the total rainfall, around 11% is lost as surface runoff, 10% is lost through evaporation and transpiration, 30% is utilized for consumptive used, 16% is absorbed as subsoil loss and remaining only 33% is stored as groundwater recharge. Again out of total groundwater recharge only 85% is utilizable groundwater. The annual utilizable groundwater resource available in the area is 79.220 million cubic metre (MCM).

Remote Sensing (RS) refers to the science of identification of earth surface features and estimation of their geo-biophysical properties using electromagnetic radiation as a medium of interaction. Spectral, spatial, temporal and polarization signatures are major characteristics of the sensor/target, which facilitate target discrimination. Earth surface data as seen by the sensors in different wavelengths (reflected, scattered and/or emitted) is radiometrically and geometrically corrected before extraction of spectral information [2, 3]. Remote Sensing data, with its ability for a synoptic view, repetitive coverage with calibrated sensors to detect changes, observations at different resolutions, provides a better alternative for natural resources management as compared to traditional methods [4,\"], [\"Abstract: 'Open-cast mining generates sediment in river systems at globally significant scales. One of the challenges in attributing measured sediment loads to upstream mining activities is establishing the source of sediments that are a mixture of natural and mining-based materials. The environmental magnetic data (mass-specific magnetic susceptibility, anhysteretic remanent magnetisation, isothermal remanent magnetisation and inter-parametric ratios) on 57 samples of suspended sediment from the Bhadra River in the Sahyadri (the Western Ghat) of India have been used in this study. Samples were collected upstream, adjacent to and downstream of Kudremukh, a mountainous and high rainfall site where the largest mechanised open-cast mine in south Asia was located. Graphical and multivariate analyses and modelling of the data show that on average ~29% of the river suspended load downstream of the mine is derived from mining and allied activities at Kudremukh although the mine occupies less than 5% of the catchment. The contribution of primary ore is the maximum (18%), followed by transitional hard weathered ore (7%) and weathered ore (4%). The model has done a fairly good job of unmixing; the sum of errors is <1 for 40 samples, for five samples and >71,000 for four samples. Modelling of samples with small mass seems to produce large errors. This investigation demonstrates the utility of environmental magnetic data, which can be obtained in a simple and rapid manner, and the unmixing of such data in identifying the contribution of mining activities to the total suspended sediment load.'\"], [\"Abstract: ''\"], [\"Abstract: 'This study presents statistical analysis of hydrogeochemical data of the groundwater samples collected from the layered formations of the Cretaceous, Tertiary (Lower Cuddalore and Upper Cuddalore) and Quaternary in Pondicherry region, South India.

The results obtained from statistical analysis of 11 important hydrochemical parameters indicate dissimilar elemental correlations among aquifers. Quaternary aquifer exhibit good correlations among ion pairs and indicating source controls like salts from unsaturated zone, fertilizers, industrial wastes and also processes like ion exchange. Upper and lower Tertiary aquifers have good correlations among ions as indicating dominant role of silicate rock weathering processes, while Cretaceous formation show high correlations among indicating carbonate and sulphate mineral contribution. High positive ion correlations among observed in Cretaceous formation reflects contribution from marine sources. The study has also brought out the three major processes active in theses aquifers like parental, anthropogenic and mixing. The spatial distribution of the factor score for individual groundwater samples reveals the sources of the constituents that are in good agreement with those deduced from the geological and hydrogeological evidences.

In this context, the relationship between biodiversity (especially plant diversity) and soil carbon (C) sequestration (as a means of mitigating global warming) has become a subject of considerable scientific interest. This relationship was tested for homegardens (HG), a popular and sustainable agroforestry system in the tropics, in Thrissur district, Kerala, India. The major objectives were to examine how tree density and plant-stand characteristics of homegardens affect soil C sequestration. Soil samples were collected at four depths from HG of varying sizes and age classes, and their total C content determined. Tree density and plant-stand characteristics such as species richness (Margalef Index) and diversity (Shannon Index) of the HG were also determined. Results indicated that the soil C stock was directly related to plant diversity of HG. Homegardens with higher, compared to those with lower, number of plant species, as well as higher species richness and tree density had higher soil carbon, especially in the top of soil. Overall, within profile, soil C content ranged from 101.5 to Smaller-sized HG that had higher tree density and plant-species density had more soil C per unit area of land than larger-sized ones Soil C content, especially below was higher in older gardens. The enhanced soil-C storage in species-rich homegardens could have relevance and applications in broader ecological contexts.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'Water samples were collected from three selected mangrove ecosystems of Kali Estuary west coast Karwar, on monthly basis and analyzed for various hydrographic parameters.

The situation is rather alarming in the rivers draining the Vembanad lake catchments as the area hosts one of the fast developing urban-cum-industrial centre, the Kochi city, otherwise called the Queen of Arabian Sea. The Vembanad lake catchments are drained by seven rivers whose length varies between 78 and and catchment area between 847 and On an average, of sand and gravel are being extracted from the active channels and of sand from the river floodplains. The quantity of instream mining is about 40 times the higher than the sand input estimated in the gauging stations. As a result of indiscriminate sand mining, the riverbed in the storage zone is getting lowered at a rate of over the past two decades.

The BB is identified by enhanced radar reflectivity factor Z (dBZ) at the isotherm. The gradient of hydrometeor fall velocity is found to be a good indicator in identifying the melting layer when enhanced radar reflectivity at melting layer is not prominent. The storm structures as observed by the MRR are compared with CloudSat observations that provide evidence of ice hydrometeor at with clear indication of BB at Storm heights at warmer than are evident during NBB conditions from CloudSat. This suggests that warm rain processes are responsible for producing rain during NBB conditions. During BB conditions, bimodal DSDs below the melting layer are observed at lower altitudes. The DSDs of shallow warm precipitating systems of NBB conditions are monomodal at all the altitudes. Significantly, normalized DSDs are found to be bimodal for BB conditions, and monomodal for NBB conditions which confirm different dominant microphysical processes. It is found that the observed bimodal DSDs during BB conditions are mainly due to the collision, coalescence and break-up processes. During NBB conditions, number and size of large raindrops grow while reaching the ground without much breakup. The radar reflectivity and rainfall intensity R relationship of the form  b  are found out for BB and NBB conditions. Existing different microphysical processes lead to large coefficient in the relationship with small exponent during BB conditions while during NBB conditions the coefficients are small with large exponents.'\"], [\"Abstract: 'A study was carried out on seed characteristics of nine different tree species of six botanical families for germination and viability during three years, and Average germination percentages after 5, 10 and were 27.22, 55.56 and for all nine species.

Given that most species are described based on morphology-based alpha taxonomy, one cannot resolve nomenclatural issues of species complexes without the aid of morphology. In this study, we examined the taxonomic status of a long-known human commensal and species complex, Hemidactylus brookii. To this end, samples of H. cf. brookii and related species were collected across India. We analyzed molecular as well as morphological data to resolve the taxonomy of this species complex. Seven deeply divergent, well-supported clades were recovered using the mitochondrial phylogeny, five of which were also retrieved in the nuclear tree. One of these consists of five morphologically distinct species of ground-dwelling Hemidactylus. The genetic distances across each clade of putative species of H. brookii sensu lato were comparable to that between morphologically distinct species of ground-dwelling Hemidactylus. Meristic characters such as number of precloacal-femoral pores, number of non-pore bearing scales interrupting the series of pored scales, dorsal pholidosis, and presence/absence of divided lamellae can be used to distinguish these putative species from each other. However, morphological characters of H. brookii sensu stricto did not correspond to any of the putative species studied.

Rare species were more likely to be threatened, but 39% were not evaluated. We identified zones of rare endemics to help with conservation planning. The WG rain forests have a unique evolutionary history and potential that require increased conservation measures.'], ['Wildlife utilization in the tropics is massive, with nearly 5 million tons of bushmeat consumed by local communities. In India, a megadiversity nation, hunting—although illegal—is widespread among indigenous communities. However, the extent, frequency, and rationale for hunting, and factors influencing wildlife utilization are poorly known. Our study, based on 19 different indigenous communities in the Western Ghats region, revealed the utilization of 54 wild species/taxa. Although freshwater fish, herpetofauna, and small mammals were most frequently utilized, enforcement by the Forest Department was largely focused on large mammals. Gender, land ownership, number of domestic meats consumed, distance to markets, time spent hunting, and distance to hunting areas were major factors that affected wild meat utilization in the region. Although conservation needs to be focused on the most utilized groups, increasing access to domestic meats at remote settlements and integrating utilization of common, culturally prominent species can improve conservation of threatened fauna.'], [\"A meaningful effort for the preservation of endemism would require a deep understanding of its related mechanisms and an accurate estimation of its spatial distribution. Here, we applied methods dedicated to species distribution modelling (SDM) to map an integrated index in India's Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, the endemic tree richness, and to use it for recommendations of protected areas. We then rigorously compared SDM results with spatially explicit and multiscale comparison tools, among them the cutting-edge correlation map and profile (CMP) technique, to finally draw up an endemic richness map with improved accuracy.The endemic richness showed a sharply increasing southward gradient in the Western Ghats, mainly driven by the seasonality of the temperature and the precipitation's stability. This precise quantification of the tree endemism pattern in peninsular India helped in identifying vulnerable areas in terms of conservation of biodiversity as a whole. The Indian authorities recently used our recommendations to extend protected areas in the southern tip of the Indian peninsula to conserve this endemic richness. We believe that spatial analyses and multiscale comparison tools such as those presented here can help conservationists everywhere to better cope with the difficulties met in identifying zones for protected status.\"], ['Identifying and prioritising naturally occurring within-species diversity, which may correlate with local adaptations or vicariance, is an integral part of conservation planning. Using non-invasive sampling and a panel of 11 microsatellites on 158 individual tigers from a pan India sample, our evaluation revealed three population clusters in India: unique North-Eastern tigers, a combined cluster of Western Ghats, Western India and Terai tigers, and a mixed cluster from Central India. At further population division, tigers from Odisha, Valmiki and southern Western Ghats were distinct. Central Indian tigers were most diverse, but showed the highest level of local structuring, suggestive of human induced fragmentation. We show that tigers in India are genetically structured and some clusters are unique. Considering a combined analysis of population size, genetic diversity and uniqueness, tigers from the North-East hills, and southern Western Ghats emerge as conservation priorities. We propose reintroductions and supplementation of tigers be done among the same broad genetic clusters. Restoration and management of habitat corridors is vital for anthropogenically fragmented Central Indian populations. This study suggests a paradigm shift from indiscriminately doubling tiger numbers to prioritising conservation of naturally occurring diversity amongst tigers, to retain their full evolutionary potential, while managing to mitigate anthropogenic induced genetic structuring.'], ['Detailed mapping and regular monitoring of tropical rainforests is important for conservation and management of highly fragmented tropical rainforest habitats and biodiversity. Several studies have observed that it is highly challenging to map different vegetation types in tropical rainforests due to large environmental heterogeneity, high topographical variability and near constant cloud cover. In the present study, we assessed the capability of optical multispectral Sentinel-2 MSI bands, their derived NDVI and textures, and SAR Sentinel-1 bands and their textures to discriminate different vegetation types in the tropical rainforests of the Western Ghats using maximum likelihood and random forest classification. We also compared the results of our classification with previous such maps of the study area. Finally, we evaluated the magnitude of habitat fragmentation by using derived landscape metrics. Our classification had high accuracy (>75%), especially compared to previous classification efforts. Our results emphasise the significance of using vegetation indices and textures for vegetation type classification in the Western Ghats. Furthermore, the results suggest that rainforest habitats and other agro-ecosystems, suitable as habitats for numerous plant and animal species, are highly fragmented and require top conservation priority. High spectral and spatial resolution, continuity, affordability and access makes Sentinel-2 one of the best options for regular monitoring of tropical rainforests.'], ['Human-modified tropical landscapes under semi-natural or agro-ecosystems often harbor biodiversity of significant conservation value. In the Western Ghats of India, these ecosystems also provide connectivity between protected areas and other remnant forests. We investigated the conservation value of these landscapes and agro-ecosystems using results from 35 studies covering 14 taxonomic groups. Large, conspicuous taxonomic groups and tree-covered land-use types have received much focus in this area of research in the Western Ghats. We computed a response ratio defined as the log ratio of species richness in human land use to species richness in forest control site from 17 studies. In a meta-analysis, we investigated variation of this ratio across studies with respect to three variables: taxonomic group, the land-use type sampled and the extent of forest cover within the study landscape. Higher forest cover within the landscape emerged as a major positive influence on biodiversity in human-modified landscapes for vertebrates and vegetation while no patterns emerged for invertebrates. Our results suggest that loss of remnant forest patches from these landscapes is likely to reduce biodiversity within agro-ecosystems and exacerbate overall biodiversity loss across the Western Ghats. Conservation of these remnant forest patches through protection and restoration of habitat and connectivity to larger forest patches needs to be prioritized. In the densely populated Western Ghats, this can only be achieved by building partnerships with local land owners and stakeholders through innovative land-use policy and incentive schemes for conservation.'], [\"The validity of the threat status assigned to a species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List relies heavily on the accuracy of the geographic range size estimate for that species. Range maps used to assess threat status often contain large areas of unsuitable habitat, thereby overestimating range and underestimating threat. In this study, we assessed 18 endemic birds of the Western Ghats to test the accuracy of the geographic range sizes used by the IUCN for their threat assessment. Using independently reviewed data from the world's largest citizen science database (eBird) within a species distribution modeling framework, our results show that: (a) geographic ranges have been vastly overestimated by IUCN for 17 of the 18 endemic bird species; (b) range maps used by IUCN contain large areas of unsuitable habitat, and (c) ranges estimated in this study suggest provisional uplisting of IUCN threat status for at least 10 of the 18 species based on area metrics used by the IUCN for threat assessment. Since global range size is an important parameter for assigning IUCN threat status, citizen science datasets, high resolution and freely available geo-referenced ecological data, and the latest species distribution modeling techniques should be used to estimate and track changes in range extent whenever possible. The methods used here to significantly revise range estimates have important conservation management implications not only for endemic birds in the Western Ghats, but for vertebrate and invertebrate taxa worldwide.\"], ['Large mammals are declining globally due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Climate change is one of the factors known to alter the range of several mammalian species. An early understanding of the effect of climate change on species distributions can provide critical information for conservation planning. Nilgiritragus hylocrius (Nilgiri Tahr) is an endangered ungulate that is restricted to the montane grasslands of the Western Ghats, India. Currently, the Nilgiri Tahr is restricted to a fraction of its former range and is also prone to risks due to several ongoing anthropogenic pressures. However, the impact of global climate change on this emblematic species has seldom been estimated. The goal of our study was to use ecological niche models to quantify the effect of climate change on the habitats of Nilgiri Tahr. Using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm, we modelled the potential distribution of Nilgiri Tahr in its native range. The models were developed under the current climatic conditions and then projected onto two future climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and for three different time frames in the future (years 2030, 2050 and 2080). We identified that most of the climatically suitable habitats of Nilgiri Tahr would become unsuitable when global warming intensifies. Our models predicted a complete loss of suitable habitats in many existing protected areas in the Western Ghats. We use insights provided by our modeling results to propose conservation management plans to increase the likelihood of persistence of Nilgiri Tahr in the Western Ghats.'], ['Climate change has the potential to have significant influence on distribution of many species and alter ecosystems. With the current estimates of rate of projected environmental change for the 21st century, urgent adaptation and mitigation measures are required to slow down the impact of climate change on biodiversity. A number of studies have shown that recent human-induced environmental changes have already triggered species range shifts, changes in phenology and species extinctions. However, accurate projections of species responses to future climate change are more difficult to ascertain. In recent years, a number of modeling tools are being used to predict the consequences of climate change on the distribution of species and also identify possible ecological niche of a species under different climate change scenarios.In this paper, using the distribution data of the species, we have attempted to (a) identify the current geographical distribution of five species of the family Myristicaceae and predict the possible sites of occurrence of these species in the Western Ghats, India using the niche modeling tools and (b) predict the impact of climate change on the potential distribution of these species for two scenarios (A1B and A2A). All the five species selected for the study are distributed in the Western Ghats with higher densities in the Central Western Ghats. The model predicted an overall increase in the suitable habitats for the non-swampy species. However, there is a shift in the habitat range of these species in response to climate change. Gymnocranthera canarica and Myristica fatua, which are obligate swampy species, tend to be affected in changing climate. For both these species, the overall habitat is reduced due to climate change. These species already have restricted habitat and therefore climate change could pose a serious threat for their future survival. Predicting how species distribution will change in the wake of future global climate change is important to develop effective conservation strategies for these species, which inhabit fragile ecosystems.'], ['The ongoing introduction of the exotic Grevillea robusta tree species into agroforestry systems (AFS) of the Indian Western Ghats could become a threat to both climate change mitigation and tree diversity conservation.Here, we quantified carbon (C) storage and shade tree diversity in native forests and coffee AFS under contrasted management (native versus exotic shade trees, Robusta versus Arabica systems) at 67 plots along a 3500\\u202fmm precipitation gradient in the Cauvery watershed, India.Despite a substantial reduction of shade tree cover in native AFS compared to forest (from 90% to 32% in the high precipitation area), native AFS and forests displayed high and comparable C stocks (max. 228 MgC ha−1 and 234 MgC ha-1, respectively) and tree diversity (max. 44 and 45 species, respectively). Both variables were negatively impacted by the introduction of G. robusta, especially in Robusta coffee systems (max. 158 MgC ha−1, 12 species).The current trend toward the introduction of G. robusta in coffee AFS of the study area (exotic agroforestry) negatively affects C storage and tree diversity, especially in Robusta coffee systems. Policy makers should take advantage of the carbon-tree diversity positive correlation found in the agroforestry landscape of the Western Ghats of India to promote conservation and climate change mitigation.'], ['The diversity of hillstream loaches in the northern part of the Western Ghats region of India was studied for the first time using two mitochondrial genes, cytochrome oxidase subunit I and cytochrome b. Phylogenetic analysis revealed monophyletic groups corresponding to the genera Indoreonectes, Paracanthocobitis, Nemacheilus, Schistura and Nemachilichthys (family Nemacheilidae), and Balitora, Lepidocephalichthys and Botia (families Balitoridae, Cobitidae and Botiidae respectively). While there was little inter-population genetic divergence for genera such as Nemacheilus, Nemachilichthys, Balitora and Botia, each of which harbored a single species, there were distinct clades observed for Indoreonectes, Paracanthocobitis, Schistura and Lepidocephalichthys, which were supported through species delimitation by Poisson Tree Processes, Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescence and barcode gap analysis. We show that Indoreonectes evezardi, currently considered to be a wide-ranging species, is a ‘complex’ comprising of several genetically distinct clades indicating the presence of undescribed species. Further, we also suggest a possibility of hidden species diversity within the genera Paracanthocobitis, Schistura and Lepidocephalichthys. Based on different species delimitation methods, we suggest that there could be between 23 and 31 species of loaches belonging to eight genera and four families in the northern part of the Western Ghats of India. Our study substantially contributes to the understanding of the diversity and conservation status of loaches in this region.'], ['In recent years, climate change has become a major threat and has been widely documented in the geographic distribution of many plant species. However, the impacts of climate change on the distribution of ecologically vulnerable medicinal species remain largely unknown. The identification of a suitable habitat for a species under climate change scenario is a significant step towards the mitigation of biodiversity decline. The study, therefore, aims to predict the impact of current, and future climatic scenarios on the distribution of the threatened Garcinia indica across the northern Western Ghats using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modelling. The future projections were made for the year 2050 and 2070 with all Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenario (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) using 56 species occurrence data, and 19 bioclimatic predictors from the BCC-CSM1.1 model of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change’s (IPCC) 5th assessment. The bioclimatic variables were minimised to a smaller number of variables after a multicollinearity test, and their contributions were assessed using jackknife test. The AUC value of 0.956\\u202f±\\u202f0.023 indicates that the model performs with excellent accuracy. The study identified that temperature seasonality (39.5\\u202f±\\u202f3.1%), isothermality (19.2\\u202f±\\u202f1.6%), and annual precipitation (12.7\\u202f±\\u202f1.7%) would be the major influencing variables in the current and future distribution. The model predicted 10.50% (19318.7\\u202fsq.\\u202fkm) of the study area as moderately to very highly suitable, while 82.60% (151904\\u202fsq.\\u202fkm) of the study area was identified as ‘unsuitable’ or ‘very low suitable’. Our predictions of Climate change impact on habitat suitability suggest that there will be a drastic reduction in the suitability by 5.29% and 5.69% under RCP 8.5 for 2050 and 2070, respectively.Objective and SignificancePrimary objective of this study is to identify the potential distribution of medicinally and ecologically important but threatened Garcinia indica species in the northern Western Ghats on the basis of species occurrence data and nineteen bioclimatic predictors. Using MaxEnt modelling, current and future species distribution and suitability has been predicted using the BCC-CSM1.1 and four RCP scenarios of 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5. The results also signify the bioclimatic variables contribution to the species distribution in northern Western Ghats.Finally, the results signify that the model might be an efficient tool for biodiversity protection, ecosystem management, and species re-habitation planning under future climate change scenarios.'], ['Areas of high conservation value were identified in the Western Ghats using a systematic conservation planning approach. Surrogates were chosen and assessed for effectiveness on the basis of spatial congruence using Pearson’s correlations and Mantel’s tests. The surrogates were, threatened and endemic plant and vertebrate species, unfragmented forest areas, dry forests, sub-regionally rare vegetation types, and a remotely sensed surrogate for unique evergreen ecosystems. At the scale of this analysis, amphibian richness was most highly correlated with overall threatened and endemic species richness, whereas mammals, especially wide-ranging species, were better at capturing overall animal and habitat diversity. There was a significant relationship between a remote sensing based habitat surrogate and endemic tree diversity and composition. None of the taxa or habitats served as a complete surrogate for the others. Sites were prioritised on the basis of their irreplaceability value using all five surrogates. Two alternative reserve networks are presented, one with minimal representation of surrogates, and the second with 3 occurrences of each species and 25% of each habitat type. These networks cover 8% and 29% of the region respectively. Seventy percent of the completely irreplaceable sites are outside the current protected area network. While the existing protected area network meets the minimal representation target for 88% of the species chosen in this study and all of the habitat surrogates, it is not representative with regard to amphibians, endemic tree species and small mammals. Much of the prioritised unprotected area is under reserve forests and can thus be incorporated into a wider network of conservation areas.'], ['Emilia reddyi is described and illustrated as a new species from the Eastern Ghats of Andhra Pradesh, India.

Large scale land use land cover (LULC) change leading to deforestation is one of the drivers of global climate changes and alteration of biogeochemical cycles with significant consequences in ecosystem services and biodiversity. This has necessitated the investigation of LULC by mapping, monitoring and modelling spatio-temporal patterns and evaluating these in the context of human-environment interactions. The current work investigates LULC changes with temperature dynamics of select protected areas in Western Ghats. The land use analyses reveal changes in the forest cover across Kudremukh National Park (KNP), Rajiv Gandhi Tiger Reserve (RTR), Bandipur Tiger Reserve (BTR). KNP region has lost evergreen forest cover during 1973–2016 from 33.46 to 27.22%, while BTR lost deciduous cover from 61.69 to 47.3% due to mining, horticulture plantations, human habitations, etc. The LST increase has impacted regeneration of species with the induced water stress, etc. CA-Markov modelling was used for forecasting the likely land uses in 2026 and validation was done through Kappa indices. Results highlight decline of evergreen cover in KNP (9%) and deciduous cover in RTR (2%) followed by BTR (3%) with further expansion of plantations, which will impact biodiversity, hydrology and ecology. Insights of LULC dynamics help natural resource managers in evolving appropriate strategies to ensure conservation of threatened biota in Western Ghats.'], ['Assessment of the pre- and post-development impacts of a watershed predisposed to erosion is an important step in planning sustainable development strategies. Erosion susceptibility of a small mountain watershed, Palar in the Western Ghats, is assessed by employing a weighted linear combination (WLC) model combined with terrain attributes. The WLC model shows that relative relief, slope, curvature, and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) significantly affect the susceptibility of the watershed to erosion, whereas the wetness index, stream power index, and drainage density have minimal effect. A comparison of the WLC model with the empirical revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model shows that zones prone to severe erosion remain the same, whereas zones prone to moderate and low erosion are significantly different. In the WLC-based erosion susceptibility model, zones prone to moderate erosion dominate the spatial distribution, whereas in the RUSLE model the low-erosion category dominates. The results of our study can be applied to natural hazards management, land development impacts, land degradation, and spatial modelling where terrain features are influential.'], ['Influenced by global concerns around climate change mitigation, reduction in carbon emissions and energy security, countries are increasingly focussing on increasing the share of renewable energy. Various national and provincial level authorities are aggressively promoting renewable energy expansion, resulting in new geographies of renewable energy. The expansion of renewable energy, particularly large-scale projects, is contingent upon access to natural resources. However, areas that have high natural resource endowment for renewable energy, often have other overlapping uses of natural resources, including livelihoods and biodiversity. And renewable energy projects located in these areas compete with these other multiple uses of natural resources, often leading to unintended consequences. This study employs ethnographic methods to analyse the case of local opposition to a 113\\u202fMW wind power project, located in the Western Ghats of India. India, an emerging economy, is the fourth largest producer of wind energy worldwide and is expanding the share of renewable energy through national as well as provincial level policies. The Western Ghats are a designated UNESCO world heritage site for their exceptional biodiversity and the wind power project conflicted with natural resource-based livelihoods of indigenous populations and threatened their subsistence agricultural practices along with posing a threat to the ecology of the landscape. As a result, local activists protested against the wind power project and this contestation was animated and influenced by a variety of public, civic and private actors and institutions across scale. This paper uses insights from political ecology and energy geography to shed light on the interaction between these multiple actors and how this interaction mediated the contestations around renewable energy. It focuses on the micropolitics of this contestation to highlight the social and political processes that underpin the transition to sustainable energy. It sheds light on local struggles and contestations around renewable energy projects in conjunction with national and global commitments and shows how contestations around renewable energy in the Global South are distinct from the largely prevalent NIMBY approaches in the developed countries. This study contributes to global debates around governing renewable energy, particularly in developing countries.'], ['The aim of the present study was to develop a protocol for in vitro propagation and genetic stability analysis of Ceropegia panchganiensis Blatter and McCann, a threatened ornamental plant of Western Ghats, India. Axillary shoots were generated from nodal explants on MS medium supplemented with different concentrations of plant growth regulators. The best frequencies of shoot multiplication (100\\xa0±\\xa00.0%), maximum numbers of shoots (13.2\\xa0±\\xa00.5) and longest shoot lengths (10.1\\xa0±\\xa00.8\\xa0cm) were obtained on MS media containing BAP (13.31\\xa0μM) and NAA (2.69\\xa0μM). Optimum callus induction response (95\\xa0±\\xa02.3%) was observed on MS medium supplemented with 2,4-D (9.05\\xa0μM).

Mean gross soil erosion in MRB is 14.36\\xa0t\\xa0ha−1\\xa0yr−1, whereas mean net soil erosion (i.e., gross erosion–deposition) is only 3.60\\xa0t\\xa0ha−1\\xa0yr−1 (i.e., roughly 25% of the gross erosion). Majority of the basin area (∼86%) experiences only slight erosion (<5\\xa0t\\xa0ha−1\\xa0yr−1), and nearly 3% of the area functions as depositional environment for the eroded sediments (e.g., the terraces of stream reaches, the gentle plains as well as the foot slopes of the plateau scarps and the terrain with concordant summits). Although mean gross soil erosion rates in the natural vegetation belts are relatively higher, compared to agriculture, settlement/built-up areas and tea plantation, the sediment transport efficiency in agricultural areas and tea plantation is significantly high, reflecting the role of human activities on accelerated soil erosion. In MRB, on a mean basis, 0.42\\xa0t of soil organic carbon (SOC) content is being eroded per hectare annually, and SOC loss from the 4th order sub-basins shows considerable differences, mainly due to the spatial variability in the gross soil erosion rates among the sub-basins.

Although natural vegetation belts show relatively higher gross- and net-soil erosion rates (mainly due to high LS and C factors), their sediment transport efficiency is remarkably less, compared to the land use/ land cover types with anthropogenic signatures (i.e., plantations and croplands). Despite the lesser amount of annual rainfall, the high rates of soil loss from the semi-arid areas of the basin might be the result of the poor protective vegetation cover as well as isolated high intensity rainfall events.

The habitat structure of three sympatric otter species, viz. the smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata), the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) and the Asian small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinereus) was examined in five Protected Areas (PA) of the southern Western Ghats, India. Data on habitat structure and otter signs were collected in each one-km section of 28 different streams and rivers. Mean values of eight habitat variables were used to define habitat characteristics. Components extracted in PCA from these eight variables were used for preparing a three dimensional ordination plot overlaid with otter occurrence. The results indicated that the otters differed in their habitat use. The Asian small-clawed otter used narrow streams at higher-elevation regions (>\\xa0950\\xa0m) of southern Western Ghats, whereas the Eurasian otter mostly used small rivers in a wider elevation range between 450 and 950\\xa0m. The smooth-coated otter was mostly confined to large rivers, lakes and reservoirs at a lower elevation between 200 and 700\\xa0m. The Asian small-clawed otter preferred habitats characterized by high-elevation, narrow streams with tall and dense shoreline herb cover. In contrast, the other two species used markedly different habitat types including middle and low elevation, slow-flowing rivers which were comparatively wider than the ones preferred by the Asian small-clawed otter and with tall trees and dense canopy. The persistence of otters in India is threatened due to anthropogenic pressures. This study has identified priority habitats in southern Western Ghats that need concerted efforts to conserve the dwindling otter populations.'], ['Natural resources are experiencing unprecedented pressures due to land use and land cover (LULC) changes. Such changes in LULC have significantly affected the extent and condition of forests in the Eastern Ghats of India causing a decline in the forest cover as well as disturbing the habitats of several rare, endangered, threatened (RET) and endemic species. The current study attempts to determine the habitat suitability and threat of a selected group of plants viz, RET and endemic species. This is realized in light of LULC change and forest fragmentation over a period of ∼100 years to understand the possible conservation strategies in the study area. Historical maps and satellite images from 1920 to 2015 were used to develop the LULC and fragmentation maps. MaxEnt species distribution model were used to simulate the distribution of RET and endemic species. Our study reveals that, by and large, the Eastern Ghats have lost 15.83% of its forest area over a span of ∼100 years. For the study period from 1920 to 2015, it is estimated that about 7.92% of forest area was converted into agriculture, and up to 3.80% into scrub/grassland respectively. Also, it was found that the total number of forest patches have been increased from 1509 in 1920–9457 in 2015, core area has declined from 93461.05\\xa0sq.km in 1920–61262.11\\xa0sq.km in 2015, and edge length has increased to 2.20\\xa0sq.km in 2015 as compared to 0.82\\xa0sq.km in 1920.

Habitat reduction has mainly occurred in the districts of Gajapati (Odisha state), Mahbubnagar (Telangana state) and also in Nallamalai and Kolli hill ranges. The species mostly spread across and the suitable habitats was found outside the rages of protected areas. From the present study we recommend that appropriate conservation strategies should be initiated on these threatened areas to prevent further decline in the extent and habitat quality of the RET and endemic species in Eastern Ghats.'], ['This paper presents a study of phytoliths (opal silica bodies from plants) from sediment sequences obtained from two tropical forest patches in the Western Ghats of India: a sacred grove (sequence covers last 550\\xa0cal BP) and a forest patch in a plantation (sequence covers last 7500\\xa0cal BP). The sites are located at mid-elevation (c. 650–1400\\xa0m above sea level) in a mosaic landscape showing anthropogenic open habitats and plantations as well as some evergreen forests. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the landscape composition of grassland and forest over time in the region, grassland being invariably shaped by anthropogenic activities, particularly fire for cultivation. We identified and classified phytoliths into 34 morphotypes from five taxonomic groups: Poaceae (grasses), Cyperaceae (sedges), Arecaceae (palms), Pteridopsida (ferns) and woody dicotyledons (broad-leaved trees and shrubs). We also calculated the humidity–aridity index (Iph). First, our results show that grasses are the most represented phytolith types in both sites, followed by broad-leaved trees and shrubs, palms, sedges, and ferns. Second, the highly variable climatic index Iph over the last 1000 years suggest that changes in phytolith percentage (e.g. broad-leaved trees) might be caused by human agro-pastoral activities, such as clearing through fires and irrigation. Prior to these human activities, the phytolith signal for early Holocene climate is congruent with the existing literature. Finally, this study compares new phytolith results with previous pollen data from the same sites. We find good agreement between these two botanical proxies throughout, thus validating our findings. We provide important evidence regarding the history of environmental change due to anthropogenic activities in the Western Ghats. This has important implications because it provides insights into how tropical forest will respond to increased intensity of human activities.'], ['The negative impact of anthropogenic activity on tropical forests is well documented, but the underlying factors, including socioeconomic conditions, government policy, and agricultural practices, that influence forest degradation in developing countries are poorly understood. For centuries, Soppinabetta forests (SBFs) in the Western Ghats of India have provided essential habitat for wildlife and vital organic resources (leaf litter, green foliage) for the cultivation of betel nut palms (Areca catechu) and rice paddy (Oryza sativa). Historically, betel nut farmers carefully managed resource extraction in SBFs, but recent changes in land use policy allow for unmitigated resource extraction by site dwellers, which may imperil the traditional sustainable management of SBFs. Site dwellers live on government allotted sites and primarily derive their income through the sale of forest-based products. We used SBFs as a model system to investigate the factors governing: (i) forest resource extraction, (ii) the effect of changing agricultural practices on the rate of resource extraction, and (iii) farmers’ perception of SBFs conservation in response to changes in governmental land use policy. Results from surveys of 90 households (57 farmers and 33 site-dwellers) and the forest department indicate individual farmers collected an average of 31.09 (range 0–125)\\xa0metric\\xa0tons of leaf litter and 19.11\\xa0metric\\xa0tons (range 0–120) of green foliage per year. Organic resource harvesting by farmers was positively correlated with the size of betel nut plantations, size of SBFs, and number of livestock owned per household. Betel nut plantations require six times more compost than food grains cultivated in field paddies. In past one decade, 33% of field paddies have been converted into betel nut plantations, increasing the strain on SBFs for forest resources. Farmers believe that when they lose provisional ownership of SBFs, site dwellers unsustainably harvest resources and severely damage SBFs. We suggest that an inclusive, local-level, farmer-driven protection be implemented to preserve the SBF heritage system of Western Ghats.'], ['The present study was aimed to explore the traditional knowledge of Irula tribal people who are practicing herbal medicine in Walayar valley, the Southern Western Ghats, India. A total number of 146 species of plants distributed in 122 genera belonging to 58 families were identified as commonly used ethnomedicinal plants by them. Interestingly, 26 new claims were also made in the present study. Through the data obtained from Irula tribal healers, the herbs were mostly used for medicine (40.4%) followed by trees (26.7%) and climbers (18.5%). In addition leaves were highly used for medicinal purposes, collected from 55 species (38%) followed by multiple parts from 18 species (12%). Acorus calamus is the species of higher use value (1.80) assessed to be prescribed most commonly for the treatment of cough. High informant consensus factor (1.0) obtained for insecticidal uses and cooling agent indicates that the usage of Canarium strictum and Melia dubia, and Mimosa pudica and Sesamum indicum respectively for that purposes had obtained high degree of agreement among the healers in using these species for the respective purposes. The most commonly used method of preparation was decoction (63%) followed by raw form (23%), paste (12%) and powder (2%). Therefore, it is suggested to take-up pharmacological and phytochemical studies to evaluate the species to confirm the traditional knowledge of Irulas on medicinal plants.'], ['Increasing anthropogenic pressures on forests, especially in the tropical regions of the world, have restricted several large mammalian species such as the Asian elephant to fragmented habitats within human-dominated landscapes. In this study, we assessed the effects of an anthropogenic landscape and its associated conflict with humans on the physiological stress responses displayed by Asian elephants in the Anamalai Hills of the Western Ghats mountains in south India. We have quantified faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations in focal individual elephants within and across herds, inhabiting both anthropogenic and natural habitats, and evaluated their physiological responses to different socio-ecological situations between November 2013 and April 2014. Physiological stress responses varied significantly among the tested elephant age- and sex categories but not across different types of social organisation. Adults generally showed higher FGM concentrations, even in the absence of stressors, than did any other age category. Males also appeared to have higher stress responses than did females. Although there was no significant variation in mean stress levels between elephants on the plateau in the absence of human interactions and those in adjacent, relatively undisturbed forest habitats, FGM concentrations increased significantly for adult and subadult individuals as well as for calves following drives, during which elephants were driven off aggressively by people. Our study emphasises the general importance of understanding individual variation in physiology and behaviour within a population of a seriously threatened mammalian species, the Asian elephant, and specifically highlights the need for long-term monitoring of the stress physiology and behavioural responses of individual elephants across both human-dominated and natural landscapes. Such studies would not only provide comprehensive insights into the adaptive biology of elephants in changing ecological regimes but also aid in the development of effective management and conservation strategies for endangered populations of the species.'], ['We studied the habitat preferences and burrow characteristics of trapdoor spiders, Idiops joida Gupta et\\xa0al 2013, within Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary and nearby reserve forests of Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka, Western Ghats, India, from January 2010 to April 2010. We sampled 293 plots using 5\\xa0m2 quadrats, randomly placed in six habitat types at four localities. Spiders showed patchy distribution throughout the study area. The density of I.\\xa0joida was highest in uncanopied habitats having sparse vegetation or bare grounds. Steep slopes were strongly preferred by spiders. Burrow characteristics of I.\\xa0joida, such as burrow diameter, depth, and lid thickness, were independent of habitat type.'], ['Sacred forest groves in the Western Ghats of India are small fragments of tropical forest that have received protection due to religious beliefs and cultural practices. These forest fragments are an example of community-based conservation and they serve as refugia for many forest-dwelling species in otherwise highly anthropogenic tropical forest-agriculture landscapes of the Indian Western Ghats. Many of these sacred forest groves are considered ancient woodlands, but there is very little information on their origins. For instance: How old are these sacred groves? Are they relics of forest that was once continuous or are they patches of regenerated vegetation? How do changes in the surrounding landscape influence the vegetation in these groves? Based on palaeoecological reconstruction in two such sacred forest groves, we determined the age of these forest fragments. Both reconstructions indicate transition from non-forest open landscape to tree-covered landscape at these sites. These finding from two sacred groves challenge the common perception that sacred forest groves are remnants of once-continuous forest; instead, some sacred groves such as those studied might be regenerated forest patches that are approximately 400\\xa0years old. This further raises a number of questions about the drivers of reforestation in these groves. What were the social and cultural circumstances which led to the recovery of forest within these patches? How did land tenure influence forest recovery? What role did religious beliefs play in forest restoration? Using Wallace’s (1956) framework of ‘cultural revitalization’ and based on historical literature and palaeoecological analysis of the two sacred groves, this paper examines the drivers of reforestation in the Western Ghats of India. It suggests various social, ecological and economic drivers of such revitalization, recognizing strong linkages between the ‘social’ and the ‘ecological’ within the social–ecological system of sacred forest groves. This example of reforestation suggests that contemporary restoration of forests needs to operate at a landscape scale and look at restoration as a social–ecological intervention in forest management.'], ['Large terrestrial wild herbivores are threatened globally, but scarce information exists on their populations outside of protected areas in South and Southeast Asia. India supports 39 species of wild herbivores, nearly two-thirds of which are threatened. While the protected area network still forms the backbone of large mammal conservation, it occupies less than 5% of India. Yet, remnant habitats outside of parks have received sparse attention to conserve threatened wild herbivores. Our study examined the effects of livestock occurrence, human proximity (distance to nearest village), and habitat factors (percentage habitat available and mean slope) on populations of large wild ungulates in a tropical forest outside of protected areas in the Western Ghats of India. We used a sign-based abundance-occupancy modelling approach to assess the effects of these variables on animal group density (λˆ) and animal group-specific detection probability (r) of three large wild ungulates (gaur Bos gaurus, sambar Rusa unicolor, and wild pig Sus scrofa). Our results reveal that in human-dominated tropical forests, gaur group density increases with larger available habitat and lower occurrence of livestock, while sambar group density increases with higher mean slope and lower occurrence of livestock. Contrary to expectation, sambar group density was higher in smaller available habitat. No variable could reliably explain wild pig group density, but the species is a known generalist. Our results have important implications for conservation of threatened large herbivores and management of remnant tropical forest habitats outside protected areas, especially Reserved Forests in the Indian context. Remnant habitats can support significant populations of large herbivores and need to be protected in developing South and Southeast Asian countries. Gradual improvement in livestock management practices will benefit large herbivore populations in priority regions outside of protected parks in India.'], ['IntroductionTraditional medicine plays an important role in the primary healthcare of people residing in forest areas and selling raw herbal products provides livelihood opportunities. In view of this, an extensive survey was undertaken among local people and herbalists in Sathyamangalam forests of Western Ghats, India in order to conduct a quantitative analysis of traditional knowledge about herbal medicines practiced along with their market potential.MethodsData associated with the information collected from ethnic people were analysed using the frequency of citations. During the survey period, 45 informants were identified who had much knowledge on practicing herbal medicines.ResultsA total of 78 plants representing 41 families and 68 genera were recorded to treat 40 types of ailments. Of these 64 species were sold by traders, local people and herbalists in herbal markets. Also 71 species of documented plants were included in the list of traded Indian plants.ConclusionOur study exhibited the importance of plant sources to human welfare which can serve as a key for discovery of potential new drugs. Through the results of our explorative field survey and previous reports, Andrographis alata, Aristolochia bracteolata, Aristolochia tagala, Bulbophylum fuscopurpureum, Canarium strictum, Cinnamomum tamala, Curculigo orchioides, Ipomoea obscura, Mucuna pruriens, Pandanus odoardii and Tylophora asthmatica were investigated pharmacologically, as these plants were frequently used by studied ethnic people. So we suggest that there is a need for more future scientific research on these plants to determine their efficacy and safety based on their associated ethnomedicinal uses documented in the present study.'], ['Market-based instruments (MBIs) have proliferated to address environmental degradation outside Protected Areas (PAs). Coffee plantations have been one of the most active spaces for MBIs through third-party certifications. In the certification context, the logic of extrinsic motivators is explicitly used to incentivise coffee growers in the short-term to adopt environmentally sustainable and socially responsible production, including maintaining native tree species on plantations. Coffee growers that qualify with the environmental and social standards are audited, certified and eligible to the incentive. However, there is little empirical evidence on what encourages people to adopt and maintain an ecologically compatible lifestyle. This paper attempts to question the assumption regarding the importance of extrinsic catalysts as a motivation for changes in land management strategies. We test this hypothesis in the Indian context, where the history of direct payments for conservation has been very limited. Our work finally ask the question: have conservation programmes that use direct payments ignored intrinsic motivations in their programme design? The empirical findings presented in this paper contribute to a better understanding of the range of psychological, behavioral and social factors that drive these land-use and land management decisions and explicitly engage with debates on crowding-in and crowding-out in conservation.'], ['Tropical forests are among the largest terrestrial reservoirs of carbon, and play an important role in regulating global climate. However, as a result of historic and ongoing deforestation, carbon storage in this biome is increasingly dependent on forests that are fragmented and used by humans, with considerable uncertainty about how such disturbance alters carbon storage potential and cycling. Here, we evaluate differences in above-ground carbon stocks between fragmented and contiguous evergreen forests in the central Western Ghats, India. We also assess differences in the structure, tree allometry and functional composition of forest stands between contiguous and fragmented forests, and explore how these differences influence carbon storage in fragmented forests. Relatively large, well-protected forest fragments currently store 40% less carbon per hectare above ground than contiguous forests. These differences in carbon are related to (i) lower tree density and basal area in fragments, (ii) lower average stand height in fragments, and (iii) compositional shifts favoring species with lower wood densities. Reduced stand height in fragments was associated with intra-specific variation in tree allometry, with trees in fragments being relatively shorter at any given diameter than conspecifics in contiguous forests. Further, the relatively skewed distribution of carbon storage within a few large trees in current-day fragments is added cause for concern: carbon stocks in fragments are likely to decline further in the future, following the eventual death of large trees. Active management and restoration to mitigate ecologically driven changes in habitat structure and species composition might be as important as improved management of resource use and protection from exploitation in order to sustain carbon storage ecosystem services provided by these tropical forest fragments.'], ['ObjectiveTo isolate the actinomycetes from Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu with its antimicrobial properties.MethodsStarch casein agar medium supplemented with actidione and nalidixic acid was used to isolate actinomycetes from Western Ghates region of Kanyakumari, Thirunelveli, Dindigul and Nilgiri districts. Modified nutrient medium was used as the base for screening actinomycetes against pathogenic Gram positive, Gram negative and filamentous fungi.ResultsAmong 367 actinomycetes; 17.71% showed activity against both bacteria and fungi. The highest antibacterial activity was observed against B. subtilis, 140 isolates (38.1%), S. aureus 128 (34.9%); S. epidermidis 123 (33.5%); P. aeruginosa 105 (28.6%); K. pneumoniae 88 (24%); Xanthomonas sp 62 (16.9%). Less number of actinomycetes showed activity against Erwinia, S. typhi, V. fischeri and P. vulgaris. Hundred and three isolates showed activity against B. cinerea and A. niger. Twenty five isolates revealed activity against T. simii.ConclusionsPresent investigation concludes that Western Ghats region of Tamil Nadu is the potential place for actinomycetes diversity. Further studying about these medically important strains from this region can be useful in identification of valuable bio-molecules.'], ['A critical handicap to tropical biodiversity conservation efforts in agroecosystems is the unknowns regarding the influence of landscape-scale factors on the persistence of species. To address these uncertainties, we explored two essential landscape-scale questions, within India’s biologically-rich Western Ghats, examining two nearby human-dominated landscapes that dramatically differed in their pattern of land cover. First, how does the proximity of intact forest patches affect bird community composition within agricultural landscapes? Second, can simple remote sensing-derived measures (brightness, wetness, and NDVI) be used to estimate native bird species composition within those landscapes? In both landscapes, as distance to intact forest decreased, the similarity in bird community composition between agricultural areas and intact forest increased. This suggests that the retention of tropical forest bird communities within human-dominated landscapes critically depends on the maintenance of nearby intact forest. In an answer to the second question, the remote sensing measures correlated with forest-affiliated avian species richness in only one of the two landscapes, reflecting an ecological difference between the two in the response of forest bird species to local agricultural conditions. In the landscape where a correlation was found, there was high variation in vegetative structure, which strongly impacted both the remote sensing measures and forest bird species richness. In the other landscape, forest species richness strongly correlated with changes in tree species composition in the agriculture, a factor that could not be detected by the remote sensing metrics. In order to successfully conserve biodiversity in tropical agricultural landscapes, our findings show that it is essential to conserve intact forest within those landscapes and to understand the effect of local agricultural practices on species.'], ['Seven sampling sites in each of three biomes (Western Ghats, foothills of Western Ghats and west coast) of south-western India were investigated to study the distribution, abundance and ecology of pill millipedes (Arthrosphaera)and associated fauna in relation to edaphic features. Abundance and biomass of Arthrosphaera and other millipedes were the highest in Western Ghats, while earthworms were in foothills. Arthrosphaera magna and Arthrosphaera spp. were common in Western Ghats and foothills respectively, while no Arthrosphaera were found in the west coast. None of the sampling sites consisted of more than one species of Arthrosphaera. Biomass of Arthrosphaera, other millipedes and earthworms significantly differed in Western Ghats (P =9.48 × 10−7) and foothills (P =1.35 × 10−8), as did the biomass of species of Arthrosphaera (P =2.76 × 10−7) between Western Ghats and foothills. Correlation analysis revealed that biomass of Arthrosphaera was significantly (P =0.01, r =0.45) correlated with soil organic carbon rather than other edaphic features (pH, phosphate, calcium and magnesium). Distribution pattern, abundance, biomass and ecology of Arthrosphaera of Western Ghats in relation to soil qualities were compared with millipedes of other regions of the world.'], ['Preventing and mitigating human–wildlife conflicts are a top conservation priority, particularly in India where wildlife and high densities of people co-occur. We surveyed 1972 households from 1371 villages in a 7449-km2 area surrounding five reserves in the Western Ghats. Our observational study modeled self-reported crop and livestock loss and compensation access by households. Crop loss was reported by 64% of households and associated with growing cotton, sugarcane, coffee and rice. Livestock loss was reported by 15% of households, and associated with grazing animals inside reserves. Losses incurred by households varied across reserves, averaging INR Rs 23,010 for crop loss and Rs 5423 for livestock loss. Compensation receipt was reported by 31% of households, and associated with reporting loss to authorities and elephant related incidents. Overall, landscape estimated probability of crop loss was 0.91, livestock loss was 0.19 and compensation was 0.29. Common mitigation measures for crop protection were night watching (46%), fencing (34%) and scare devices (34%); and for livestock protection were closer watch on animals (7%), guard animals (3%) and fencing (2%). Among 13 reported mitigation measures, no individual measure appeared to be associated with lowering crop or livestock loss. Unexpectedly, reported losses were similar across all reserves with higher losses incurred by households closer to the reserves. We identified conflict hot spots and influential factors across five reserves to improve current management efforts directed at conflict prevention and mitigation, and this approach is extendable to other human-dominated wildlife rich landscapes.'], ['Musa acuminata, one of the wild progenitors contributing ‘A’ genome to the present day dessert bananas, has a long evolutionary history intervened by human activities. This underexplored species is considered to be a valuable source of both biotic and abiotic stress resistance. However habitat destruction has resulted in the decline of this genetic resource. The present work deals with the seed germination studies and zygotic embryo cryopreservation of M. acuminata subsp. burmannica collected from southern Western Ghats of Kerala. Current study was conducted to access the viability of Musa seeds both in vivo and in vitro under various conditions. The experiments were carried out on seeds at different moisture conditions. Seeds were subjected to physical treatment (removal of operculum) before sawing. Different natural (soil (100%), sand (100%) and soil: sand (50:50%) mixtures) and synthetic media (Murashige and Skoog) fortified with plant growth regulators (indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (0.2, 0.5, 1.0\\xa0mg/l) and 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0\\xa0mg/l)) were tried to achieve optimum growth. Sucrose preculture (6%) for 4\\xa0h, 8\\xa0h & 12\\xa0h and air dehydration (for 1, 2, 3 & 4\\xa0h) technique was carried out for developing cryopreservation protocol for long term conservation. Under in vitro conditions, 88.5% germination was observed compared to uneven germination under in vivo conditions. Best growth was achieved in MS medium supplemented with 0.8\\xa0mg/l BAP. Seeds desiccated to moisture content 13% exhibited higher germination percentage than fresh seeds in both in vivo and in vitro conditions. Zygotic embryos with moisture content 13% could be successfully recovered after cryostorage.

Invasion of plant species in the natural ecosystem especially in the precincts of Western Ghats is due to rampant anthropogenic pressures. Complete assessment of the vegetation, richness distribution of Invasive Alien Species (IAS) and their association with the environmental drivers is essential to manage the PAs effectively. The present study analyses the richness of native vegetation with a comparative view on the distribution of Lantana camara, Chromolena odorata and Pteridium aquilinum in proposed Palani Hill National Park (PHNP), Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu. Secondly prepare models of the distribution of the target invasive species in the region. The biotic and abiotic data along with the vegetation type were generated and overlaid on IAS distribution to model the spread of target plant species. The study revealed that the distribution of invasive species negative relationship between the native species richness and positive relationship between the species dominance. Among the forest types dry evergreen, moist deciduous and tree savanna were found to be more vulnerable to invasion of Lantana camara and Chromolena odorata, wherein tree savanna and plantation were more vulnerable to invasion of Pteridium aquilinum.

The study was taken up for documentation and analysis of traditional knowledge regarding the practice and use of plants in the treatment of bone fracture. This is an effort to preserve the vanishing wealth of traditional knowledge.Materials and methodsKey informants identified in a preliminary survey and collection of information was through semi structured, open ended interviews. The details on age, place of practice, experience of key informants and learning of practice, disease they treat and mode of diagnosis, storage and usage of plants were collected. The identity of plants and their information was confirmed through repeated guided transect walks in different seasons with the informants and focus group discussions. Identified plants were deposited at the herbaria of Regional Medical Research Centre, Belgaum.ResultsForty four key informants providing treatment for bone fracture in this region were identified. Thirty eight plant species belonging to 24 families have been documented in the present study. Highest number of species representation is found in families Euphorbiaceae and Fabaceae. The habit of the species showed that 45% of the herbal drugs were obtained from trees, followed by herbs, shrubs and climbers and majority of plants used were collected from wild (76%). The stem or stem bark (33%) was most commonly used plant part to prepare medicine. Twenty six formulations of 30 plant species were directly used in treating bone fracture, where Cissus quadrangularis has the highest use-value (0.14). Eleven plants were found to be administered for bone strengthening, pain relieving, inflammation reduction and speedy recovery and Gmelina arborea has the highest use value (0.27).ConclusionsThe results indicated the importance of traditional herbal practices in community for their health needs. Both conservational strategies and further validation studies are the need of the hour for better utilization and sustenance of the documented knowledge.'], [\"To conserve biodiversity it is imperative that we understand how different species respond to land use change, and determine the scales at which habitat changes affect species' persistence. We used habitat suitability models (HSMs) at spatial scales from 100–4000\\xa0m to address these concerns for bats in the Western Ghats of India, a biodiversity hotspot of global importance where the habitat requirements of bats are poorly understood. We used acoustic and capture data to build fine scale HSMs for ten species (Hesperoptenus tickelli, Miniopterus fuliginosus, Miniopterus pusillus, Myotis horsfieldii, Pipistrellus ceylonicus, Megaderma spasma, Hipposideros pomona, Rhinolophus beddomei, Rhinolophus indorouxii and Rhinolophus lepidus) in a tea-dominated landscape. Small (100–500\\xa0m) scale habitat variables (e.g. percentage tea plantation cover) and distances to habitat features (e.g. distance to water) were the strongest predictors of bat occurrence, likely due to their high mobility, which enables them to exploit even small or isolated foraging areas. Most species showed a positive response to coffee plantations grown under native shade and to forest fragments, but a negative response to more heavily modified tea plantations. Two species were never recorded in tea plantations. This is the first study of bats in tea plantations globally, and the first ecological Old World bat study to combine acoustic and capture data. Our results suggest that although bats respond negatively to tea plantations, tea-dominated landscapes that also contain forest fragments and shade coffee can nevertheless support many bat species.\"], ['The Kondapalli reserve forest (KRF) of the Eastern Ghats, India is subjected to severe anthropogenic interference, despite its status as reserve forest. The present research focuses on assessing the land use and land cover changes in and around KRF using temporal satellite data. It is evident from the current study that there has been a considerable decrease in the forest cover from 1990 to 2015; as seen from 2017 data, huge urban expansions and development activities were observed around KRF. This increase is linked to the growth in population, thereby consuming land available for their basic needs. To assess the rate of urban expansion around the forest, Land consumption rate and Land absorption coefficient were computed. The result of this analysis showed a rapid growth in built-up land between 1990 and 2017 while the periods between 1990 and 2015 witnessed a reduction in the forest class. Further, the study projected adverse impact of the growth of the new capital city-Amaravati on the KRF and proposed requiring suitable conservation measures with respect to its current deforestation and degradation trends.'], ['Three well-supported generalizations in conservation biology are that developing tropical countries will experience the greatest biodiversity declines in the near future, they are some of the least studied areas in the world, and in these regions especially, protection requires local community support. We assess these generalizations in an evaluation of protected areas in India. The 5% of India officially protected covers most ecoregions and protected areas have been an important reason why India has suffered no documented species extinctions in the past 70\\u202fyears. India has strong legislation favouring conservation, government investment focused on 50 Tiger Reserves, and government compensation schemes that facilitate local support, all of which brighten future prospects. However, many protected areas are too small to maintain a full complement of species, making connectivity and species use of buffer zones a crucial issue. Conservation success and challenges vary across regions according to their development status. In less developed areas, notably the biodiverse northeast Himalaya, protected areas maintaining the highest biodiversity result from locally-focused efforts by dedicated individuals. Across India, we demonstrate considerable opportunities to increase local income through ecotourism. Our evaluation confirms a lack of data, increasing threats, and the importance of local support. Research on biodiversity in buffer zones, development of long-term monitoring schemes, and assessment of cash and conservation benefits from tourism are in particular need. For policy makers, two main goals should be the development of monitoring plans for ‘eco-sensitive zones’ around protected areas, and a strong emphasis on preserving established protected areas.'], ['India is bestowed with rich diversity inter alia in natural resources, forests, water bodies, climate, people, language and crops grown. In order to sustainably manage, conserve and judicioususenatural resources, collective action bycommunity initiativeis desirable since private property rights lead to inequitable and unsustainable use. In this paper,efforts towardsconservation of natural forests through the collective action of providing social fencing reflected in the institution of sacred groves are discussed. This pertains to the village community in the Western Ghats region of Karnataka, India, committed towards stringent conservation efforts. The rituals of annual festivity called Devatehabba, (The worshiping festival of Goddess Mother Nature) as they trust are a part of the conservation efforts binding the members of the village community together for the cause of nature conservation. On the day of festivity, the village community invites relatives, friends and admirers to Devarabana (irgin forest grove maintained in the name of Mother Nature for centuries without any disturbance)for participation inworship of the Mother Nature which is called as Sacred Grove. In some villages, an icon, Idol or earthen pot structure is worshipped in the sanctum of Devarabana. The entry to the sanctum is restricted to the day of annual worship in the year.

In order to assess the ability of abandoned teak plantations to recover through regeneration, teak stands from 29 to 80 years old were sampled for seedling and sapling density, species richness and the use by large ungulates in the southern Western Ghats using 10\\xa0m circular plots. The influence of the forest-plantation edge was also studied. There was regeneration of a species-rich tree community in the understorey of abandoned teak plantations. However, regeneration was arrested, and thereby the large girth-class tree community remained species-poor. There was no significant change in the tree species richness with distance from natural forest, suggesting that the forest-plantation edge had little influence on the penetration of native tree species inside plantations. Asian elephant and Indian gaur dung densities were significantly lower in the plantations than in the forest. Indian gaur and sambar used the younger plantations intensively, and the density of their dung was negatively correlated with age of the plantation. Abandonment of mature teak stands arrested the succession of native trees. We provide evidence that abandoned teak plantations might not serve as suitable habitats for large herbivores during the dry months of the year in the region. The study highlights the need for active management of mature teak plantations inside wildlife reserves, in order to promote succession and improve the habitat for wild flora and fauna in the Western Ghats.'], ['The spatial and temporal dynamics of mosquitoes in stream pools were examined in a biosphere reserve of the Southern Western Ghats, India.

Ex. Kurtz. from Southern Western Ghats of India were assessed using RAPD markers reserpine content and morphological traits. An estimate of genetic diversity and differentiation between genotypes of breeding germplasm is of key importance for its improvement. Populations were collected from different geographical regions. Data obtained through three different methods were compared and the correlation among them was estimated. Statistical analysis showed significant differences for all horticultural characteristics among the accessions suggesting that selection for relevant characteristics could be possible. Variation in the content of Reserpine ranges from 0.192\\xa0g/100\\xa0g (population from Tusharagiri) to 1.312\\xa0g/100\\xa0g (population from Aryankavu). A high diversity within population and high genetic differentiation among them based on RAPDs were revealed caused both by habitat fragmentation of the low size of most populations and the low level of gene flow among them. The UPGMA dendrogram and PCA analysis based on reserpine content yielded higher separation among populations indicated specific adaptation of populations into clusters each of them including populations closed to their geographical origin. Genetic, chemical and morphological data were correlated based on Mantel test. Given the high differentiation among populations conservation strategies should take into account genetic diversity and chemical variation levels in relation to bioclimatic and geographic location of populations. Our results also indicate that RAPD approach along with horticultural analysis seemed to be best suited for assessing with high accuracy the genetic relationships among distinct R. serpentina accessions.'], ['This paper analyses the economics of biodiversity conservation in the context of a tropical forest ecosystem in the Western Ghats region of India, where coffee is the main competitor for land use. Using primary data covering a cross-section of coffee growers, the study notes that the opportunity costs of biodiversity conservation in terms of coffee benefits foregone are quite high. Even after including external costs due to wildlife damages and defensive expenditure to protect against wildlife, the NPVs and IRRs from coffee for all land holding groups were high. Including external costs, these NPVs across different land holding groups ranged between Rs 17 thousand to over Rs 106 thousand per acre at 12% discount rate, and the IRRs between 16.6% and 23%. Even if the expected benefits were to decrease by 20% and costs rise by a similar proportion, still the IRRs from coffee were quite high (19.5–20.1%). The study notes that the external costs accounted for between 7% and 15% of the total discounted costs of coffee cultivation, and smaller holdings proportionately incurred higher external costs as compared to large holdings. The study also notes high transaction costs incurred by the growers to claim compensation for wildlife damages. Notwithstanding these disincentives, the study notes that the local community had a positive attitude towards biodiversity conservation and were willing to pay in terms of spending time for participatory biodiversity conservation. Taking elephants, a keystone and threatened species in Asia and the study region, for the contingent valuation survey, the study notes that the respondents are willing to spend 25.8 humandays per household annually which works to over Rs 6003 per household per annum in terms of the income foregone.

Most nominal species of Indian caeciliid are diagnosed by robust haplotype clades, though the systematics of G. carnosus-like forms in northern Kerala and southern Karnataka requires substantial further investigation. For the most part, Indian caeciliid species comprise narrowly distributed, allopatric taxa with low genetic diversity. Much greater geographic genetic diversity exists among populations referred to G. seshachari, such that some populations likely represent undescribed species. This, the first phylogenetic analysis of Indian caeciliids, generally provides additional support for recent increases in described species (eight since 1999), and a framework for ongoing taxonomic revision.'], ['Lagerstroemia speciosa commonly known as ‘Banaba’ is native of south–east Asia which exhibits both horticultural and therapeutic value. The anti-diabetic and anti-obese property of the tree is attributed to corosolic acid (CRA)-a pentacyclic triterpene seen predominantly in the mature leaves. Although there are studies on either chemical or genetic variation in L. speciosa from different regions, none have dealt with their association to discuss the formation of chemical diversity. For the first time, we have analyzed CRA content in 12 natural populations corresponding to 42 samples seen in the Southern Western Ghats (SWG) using chromatography techniques and genetic variation estimated using SSR markers. Significant variation in percentage distribution of CRA ranging from 0.005% to 0.868% dr.wt. was recorded wherein populations from the north SWG contain relatively more active principle (mean\\xa0=\\xa00.321%) than their counterparts in the south (mean\\xa0=\\xa00.064%). Similarly, SSR data showing relatively high rate of gene flow (Nm\\xa0=\\xa02.72) and low genetic differentiation (FST\\xa0=\\xa00.14) is indicative that populations from north are genetically more diverse than those in the south (Nm\\xa0=\\xa00.48; FST\\xa0=\\xa00.38). The scatter plot derived by Principle Component Analysis (PCA) of chemical and genetic data shows similar pattern of clustering that reveals strong association between the two sets of data. It is concluded that the observed variation in CRA content in natural populations of the species depends more on the genetic background and less on edaphic factors.'], ['The evolution of Peninsular Indian biodiversity has been a fascinating topic of research due to historical connections of this region to the ancient Gondwanaland. We investigated the phylogeny and historical biogeography of nearly all extant species of the genus Piper reported from the region to assess the biogeographical origins and test mechanisms of lineage diversification (dispersal, vicariance and in situ radiation) of this highly diverse genus of angiosperms commonly found in the understory of evergreen forests. The phylogeny of 21 species of Piper reported from Peninsular India was reconstructed for the first time, which included three new putative species from the Western Ghats. We used BEAST for the divergence time estimations (using three constraints), and ancestral range estimations were performed with the dated phylogenetic tree using BIOGEOBEARS. Divergence dating analysis revealed that the genus Piper originated during lower Cretaceous around 110\\u202fMa [95% highest posterior density (HPD): 116–105\\u202fMa] and colonized Peninsular India five times independently, from Southeast Asia starting from the Oligocene. The two major dispersals into India occurred during the periods of 27.3\\u202fMa (95% HPD: 35.8–19.9.) and 15.5\\u202fMa (95% HPD: 24.9–7.11). This was followed by rapid radiations in some lineages with subsequent back dispersals to Southeast Asia. Our study indicates that dispersals from Southeast Asia led to the arrival of Piper to Indian subcontinent following the Indo-Eurasian collision. Members of Piper have colonized and diversified within the climatically stable habitats of Peninsular India. Furthermore, the present study provides evidence for the Miocene overland dispersal of Piper species to Africa from South Asia.'], [\"Colonial encounters with tropical ecosystems were primarily driven by profit-oriented management practices; witness the extensive network of timber and forestry practices that were set up across colonial India. In contrast, the colonial engagement with the montane forest-grassland mosaics of the higher reaches of the Western Ghats in southern India was marked by intensive investment in vegetation management by colonial foresters that yielded no profits. In this archival study, we trace the history of extensive vegetation transformation in this landscape from the early nineteenth to the early twentieth century. We show how the misperception that the grasslands within this mosaic must have resulted from tree felling, fire-setting and buffalo grazing by indigenous communities led colonial foresters into a century-long effort at ‘foresting’ the grasslands, primarily through large-scale planting of exotic tree species. These efforts persisted despite economic losses and ecological evidence that native tree seedlings planted in the grasslands repeatedly failed to establish. These policies continued unabated into the late twentieth century in newly independent India. Today, the once picturesque landscapes of these ancient forest-grassland mosaics are diminished by large-scale plantations of exotic species. Some of these species have become invasive and pose significant threats to the remnant natural grasslands. While this historical narrative is set in the forest-grassland mosaics of southern India, it finds striking parallels in the current day, with grasslands and savannas globally threatened by the misperception that they are ‘degraded ecosystems’ that can be ‘forested’ or converted to other ‘productive’ land uses. We suggest that this case history portends the potential fates of many of earth's threatened tropical grasslands and savannas.\"], ['Farmers worldwide regularly plant trees to obtain provisioning and other ecosystem services. This practice has come under scrutiny by conservationists who perceive a reduction of biodiversity due to preferential planting of exotic trees. In order to reverse this preference for exotic trees it is necessary to identify the key drivers of exotic species planting and propose alternative species of interest to farmers. We examined this question in a coffee agroforestry landscape of the Western Ghats, India, a global biodiversity hotspot. We interviewed farmers regarding tree planting behaviour, preferences and constraints, and assessed the relative performance and value of native versus exotic species. Multivariate analyses were used with six species-level characteristics and four farm-level characteristics, to reveal the most significant predictors of planting frequency.The exotic species Grevillea robusta was planted 5.4 times more often than native trees. Individual species’ planting frequencies were most strongly related to their realised economic values, which was highest for G. robusta. Native trees with greater multipurpose utility value and stature were also more likely to be planted. Farm-level characteristics related to increased planting efforts were increasing climatic dryness, increased land area with native tree tenurial rights and farm size. However, farmers with a greater proportion of land under secure tree tenure planted fewer trees.We conclude that although native trees had higher multipurpose utility and potential economic value than the exotic G. robusta, the latter is grown more often due to existing legal frameworks that restrict private ownership and realising monetary value from native species. If current laws were amended to increase the economic benefits obtained from native trees, they are likely to be planted more often by farmers. We propose that our results can help in implementation of the recent National Agroforestry Policy of India, as well as inform agroforestry policies and practice elsewhere.'], ['In this paper, we use a participatory approach, to assess the suitability of data provided by local fishers for determining the demography and harvest rates of endangered species, exploited in remotely located small-scale fisheries. We specifically focus on the Deccan Mahseer (Tor khudree) in the Western Ghats Hotspot of Peninsular India. Using catch data provided by local fishers, we assessed the dynamics of exploited populations of T. khudree from six major fishing sites having varying patterns of harvest (commercial vs. subsistence) and protection status (protected vs. non protected area). Based on annual length frequency data, growth parameters of T. khudree were worked out as L∞\\xa0=\\xa0383.25–1202.25\\xa0mm total length and K\\xa0=\\xa00.12–0.23 year−1. The length frequency data of T. khudree individuals exploited from two fishing sites indicated that a high share of the catches throughout the year, are contributed by immature size classes. The total mortality coefficient (Z) was calculated to be between 0.35 year−1 and 0.95 year−1 and the fishing mortality coefficient (F) between 0.13 year and 0.8 year. The fishing mortality rate of T. khudree in Poringal Reservoir (0.8 year) may probably be one of the highest for any species of Mahseer in India, and points to the targeted indiscriminate exploitation by local fishers. Exploitation rate (E) (0.34–0.84 year−1) was higher than the expected optimal level (0.5) at all, but one fishing sites revealing that T. khudree populations are overfished in the study region. Further, a comparison of the exploitation rate at various fishing sites revealed no significant differences between commercial and subsistence harvest, as well as inside and outside protected areas. In spite of its ‘endangered’ status, T. khudree receives no protection even in Biodiversity Hotspots like the Western Ghats, and its fishery is under threat of an imminent collapse. Management guidelines for sustainable Mahseer fishery in the region are suggested.'], [\"The cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) closure study was performed to exemplify the effect of aerosol chemical composition on the CCN activity of aerosols at Mahabaleshwar, a high altitude background site in the Western Ghats, India. For this, collocated aerosol, CCN, Elemental Carbon (EC), Organic Carbon (OC), sub-micron aerosol chemical speciation for the period from 3rd June to 19th June 2015 was used. The chemical composition of non-refractory particulate matter (<1\\xa0μm) as measured by Time of Flight – Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ToF-ACSM) was dominated by organics with average concentration of 3.81\\xa0±\\xa01.6, 0.32\\xa0±\\xa00.06, 0.15\\xa0±\\xa00.02, 0.13\\xa0±\\xa00.03 and 0.95\\xa0±\\xa00.12\\xa0μg\\xa0m−3 for organics, ammonium, chloride, nitrate and sulphate, respectively. The PM1 number concentration as obtained by Wide Range Aerosol Spectrometer (WRAS) varied from 750 to 6480\\xa0cm−3. The average mass concentration of elemental carbon (EC) as measured by OC-EC analyzer was 1.16\\xa0±\\xa00.4\\xa0μg\\xa0m−3. The average CCN concentrations obtained from CCN counter (CCNC) at five super-saturations (SS's) was 118\\xa0±\\xa058\\xa0cm−3 (0.1% SS), 873\\xa0±\\xa0448\\xa0cm−3 (0.31% SS), 1308\\xa0±\\xa0603\\xa0cm−3 (0.52% SS), 1610\\xa0±\\xa0838\\xa0cm−3 (0.73% SS) and 1826\\xa0±\\xa0985\\xa0cm−3 (0.94% SS). The CCN concentrations were predicted using Köhler theory on the basis of measured aerosol particle number size distribution, size independent NR-PM1 chemical composition and calculated hygroscopicity. The CCN closure study was evaluated for 3 scenarios, B-I (all soluble inorganics), B-IO (all soluble organics and inorganics) and B-IOOA (all soluble inorganic and soluble oxygenated organic aerosol, OOA). OOA component was derived from the positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of organic aerosol mass spectra. Considering the bulk composition as internal mixture, CCN closure study was underestimated by 16–39% for B-I and overestimated by 47–62% for B-IO. The CCN closure result was appreciably improved for B-IOOA where the knowledge of OOA fraction was introduced and uncertainty reduced to within 8–10%.\"], ['Maintaining forest cover is important for Biodiversity Hotspots that support many endangered and endemic species but have lost much of their original forest extent. In developing countries, ongoing economic and demographic growth within Hotspots can alter rates and patterns of deforestation, making it a concern to quantify rates of forest loss and assess landscape-scale correlates of deforestation within Hotspots. Such analyses can help set baselines for future monitoring and provide landscape-scale perspectives to design conservation policy. For the Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot in India, we examined correlates of forest loss following rapid economic expansion (post-2000\\u202fCE). First, we used open-source remote-sensing data to estimate annual trends in recent forest loss (from 2000 to 2016) for the entire Hotspot. Across the entire Western Ghats, we assessed the relative importance of and interactions among demographic, administrative, and biophysical factors that predicted rates of forest loss—measured as the number of 30\\u202f×\\u202f30-m\\u202fpixels of forest lost within randomly selected 1\\u202fkm2 cells. Protected areas reduced forest loss by 30%, especially when forests were closer to roads (33%) and towns (36%). However, the advantage of protection declined by 32% when local population densities increased, implying that the difference in forest loss between protected and non-protected areas disappears at high local population densities. To check scale-dependency of spatial extent, we repeated the modelling process for two landscape subsets within Western Ghats. In contrast with results for the entire Western Ghats, both focal landscapes showed no difference in deforestation with protection status alone or its interactions with village population density and distance to towns. However, deforestation was 88% lower when forests were protected and farther from roads. Overall, our results indicate that protected areas help retain forest cover within a global Biodiversity Hotspot even with rapid development, but high human population densities and road development can reduce the benefits of protection.'], ['Large mammals face high risks of anthropogenic extinction owing to their larger body mass and associated life history traits. Recent worldwide mammal declines have highlighted the conservation importance of effective assessments of trends in distribution and abundance of species. Yet reliable data depicting the nature and extent of changes in population parameters is sparse, primarily due to logistical problems in covering large areas and difficulties in obtaining reliable information at large spatial scales, particularly over time. We used key informant surveys to generate detection histories for 18 species of large mammals (body mass\\xa0>\\xa02\\xa0kg) at two points in time (present and 30\\xa0years ago) in the Southern subregion of the Western Ghats global biodiversity hotspot. Multiple-season occupancy models were used to assess temporal trends in occupancy, detectability and vital rates of extinction and colonization for each species. Our results show significant declines in distribution for large carnivores, the Asian elephant and endemic ungulates and primates. There is a significant decline in detectability for 16 species, which suggests a decline in their abundance. These patterns of change in distribution and abundance repeat in our assessments of spatial variation in occupancy dynamics between the three contiguous forest complexes and two human-dominated landscapes into which the southern Western Ghats has been fragmented. Extinction rates are highest in the human-dominated landscapes. Declines in abundance for several species suggest the presence of extinction debts, which may soon be repaid with imminent range contractions and subsequent species extinctions unless immediate remedial conservation measures are taken. Detection/non-detection surveys of key informants used in an occupancy modeling framework provide potential for rapid conservation status assessments of multiple species across large spatial scales over time.'], ['The presence of appropriate fungal mycobiont for seedling recruitment and plant nutritional support is essential for the long-term survival of orchids in managed or restored habitats. Vanda thwaitesii Hook. f., an epiphytic orchid endemic to the Western Ghats in India and Sri Lanka, endangered due to habitat destruction, necessitates a restoration programme in order to conserve them in the native habitats. Understanding of mycorrhizal association is important for restoration and therefore a symbiotic fungus from natural seedlings of V. thwaitesii was isolated and symbiotic activity evaluated. The isolated fungus having symbiotic activity designated as ‘VT3’ is a slow growing species with cottony growth, binucleate and barrel shaped monilioid cells; typical characters of a Ceratorrhiza sp., anamorph of Ceratobasidium sp. Molecular identification through sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the ribosomal RNA gene revealed that it possesses 92% similarity with an uncultured Ceratobasidiaceae clone. V. thwaitesii seeds showed higher germination rate when inoculated with VT3. Majority of the control seeds failed to develop further after the initiation of germination. After the entry of fungus, the seed showed germination and 81% of the germinated seeds was transformed into protocorms in 30\\xa0days. Promeristem formation, first leaf development or second leaf initiation occurred in 95% of the protocorms in 60\\xa0days. The protocorms in symbiotic culture developed their second leaf (55%) and roots (19%) and only 24% remained at one leaf stage by 90\\xa0days. In 150\\xa0days, 43% of the seedlings obtained were with 2–3 leaves and 2 roots and 50% of the seedlings with 3–4 leaves and 2–3 roots. Asymbiotic seedlings co-cultured with the symbiotic fungus showed vigorous growth due to active colonization in their root cortex. The results suggest that the symbiotic fungus Ceratobasidiaceae clone VT3 isolated from V. thwaitesii seedlings is promising enough to continue efforts on restoration procedures for this endangered orchid species endemic to Southern Western Ghats region in India and Sri Lanka.'], ['Our work evaluated the anthropic effects on the landscape structure of the Lençóis Maranhenses National Park (LMNP) and its Buffer Zone, and proposed strategies for the region’s conservation. LMNP is an important protected area in Brazilian north coast which protects a unique wetland ecosystem composed of sand dunes fields and a coastal vegetation called restinga. Supervised mapping of LMNP and a surrounding buffer of 3\\u202fkm was carried out through high resolution and fine scale (1:5000) satellite images. The mapped area was subdivided in 1000\\u202fha hexagonal Analysis Units (AU) and the following landscape metrics were calculated for each one of them: cover area (CA) of each soil cover class - dune fields (CA-DUNES), water bodies (CA-WATER), dense restinga (CADENSE), scattered restinga (CA-SCATTER), grassland (CA-SANDY), mangroves (CA-MANG), anthropogenic activity (CA-ANTRO) and, secondary vegetation (CA-SECOND); Landscape Shannon Diversity Index (SHDI), and; percentage of native vegetation cover (NV−COV). Pearson correlations were performed between the CA of each class and SHDI to identify the classes most correlated to CA-ANTRO. Our results showed that anthropic classes (crops, trails, and villages) had a stronger correlation (Pearson Correlation, r ≈ 0.65) with phytophysiognomies of dense restinga, secondary vegetation and SHDI, thus indicating that the land use conversion occurs in dense restinga areas and promotes vegetation secondarization, as well as increasing fragmentation. At least, 42% of the dense restinga habitats was destroyed due to human activities. Five conservation and restoration strategies were proposed in a local scale depending on the percentage of native vegetation cover on each AU, from the most to less conserved: (a) only conservation; (b) conservation with management; (c) management; (d) management and restoration; and, (e) restoration. The implementation of Agroforestry Systems with agro-successional restoration goals was recommended as an alternative for land use.'], [\"Over the last century, numbers of wild tigers (Panthera tigris) have crashed, while human populations have boomed. Here we investigate future trajectories of human population within tiger range through analysis of the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). These five pathways describe urban, rural and total population distributions by decade through 2100, based on plausible but contrasting scenarios of economic, education, migration, and urbanization policy. In 2010 approximately 57 million people lived in regions defined as “tiger conservation landscapes” (or TCLs); 8% of sympatric people lived in towns and cities that occupied 4% of tiger range. We show that tigers could share these same geographies with as few as 40 million (30% decline compared to 2010) or as many as 106 million people (an increase of 85%) by 2100. Those populations could be as much as 64%, or as little as 17%, urbanized, depending on the pathway. Urban areas are likely to expand, displacing between 6 and 22% of tiger's current range, depending on how urban growth is managed. Human population density thresholds compatible with tigers vary by region, from 140\\u202fpersons/km2 in the Indian subcontinent, to 10\\u202fpersons/km2 in the Russian Far East and northern China. SSP3, a future where nations indulge regional rivalries, would make conservation more difficult, whereas SSP1, with a focus on well-managed urbanization and education, could help relieve pressures. Tigers are a conservation-reliant species and will likely remain so through the 21st century, therefore we suggest coupling continued site-level protection with efforts to develop constituencies for conservation in Asia's burgeoning cities.\"], ['Deforestation in tropical countries has been partly attributed to the non-sustainable harvesting of forest biomass by local communities. We conducted a survey among 786 households in 31 agricultural villages adjoining the eastern boundary of the Kalakad–Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, in the southern Western Ghats to see whether household wealth, social status, literacy and distance to the forest boundary influenced resource harvesting. Fuel-wood, fodder and green leaves were the major products harvested in this agricultural region. The effect of distance from the reserve boundary differed with the product harvested and its use value. Distance was a constraint for households that harvested for domestic consumption, whereas it was not significant for households that harvested for earnings. Wealth was independent of resource interest in the forest, except for the poorer lower caste households with lower levels of literacy that sold fuel-wood to earn a living. Wealthier households harvested green leaves for fertilizing their fields, and fodder harvest was related to livestock ownership. The lower cost of forest products compared to commercially available substitutes probably fuelled extraction. Forest products contributed disproportionately to household consumption as compared with household earnings. Discouraging the harvest of forest products within protected areas might be the only viable conservation strategy.'], [\"In this article I analyze the practice and politics of classifying a tiger as a ‘man-eater’ in South India to explore what doing so reveals more broadly about the relations between animal life and the kinds of human life marked as expendable by the state. I draw on Achille Mbembe's theory of necropolitics in order to analyze how the Indian State attempts to manage human-wildlife relations in a contested plantation landscape of high priority for wildlife conservation. While there is a large literature theorizing wildlife and biodiversity conservation as the practice of biopolitics, I argue conservation, as both a typology of space and set of ideologically malleable practices, remains under-theorized as a form of necropolitics, the politics mediating death. I examine how the Indian State goes about reclassifying tigers from a strictly protected endangered species to killable—the process of making the ‘man-eater’—in relation to how the state both values and devalues human and non-human life as a process rooted in colonial histories of accumulation by dispossession. This article responds to calls across political ecology and political geography to better theorize the role of non-human animals as essential subjects of inquiry in political contestations. It does so through exploring the spatial contours of deadly encounter between plantation workers and tigers in the plantation-conservation necropolis.\"], ['The energy dynamics in Thiashola grassland, a montane subtropical vegetation in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the Western Ghats, India is studied for a period of one year.

Effective conservation in heavily-populated palaeotropical hotspots requires a better understanding of which bats can and cannot survive in human-modified landscapes. We used catching and acoustic transects to examine bat assemblages in the Western Ghats of India, and identify the species most sensitive to agricultural change. We quantified functional diversity and trait filtering of assemblages in forest fragments, tea and coffee plantations, and along rivers in tea plantations with and without forested corridors, compared to protected forests.Functional diversity in forest fragments and shade-grown coffee was similar to that in protected forests, but was far lower in tea plantations. Trait filtering was also strongest in tea plantations. Forested river corridors in tea plantations mitigated much of the loss of functional diversity and the trait filtering seen on rivers in tea plantations without forested corridors. The bats most vulnerable to intensive agriculture were frugivorous, large, had short broad wings, or made constant frequency echolocation calls. The last three features are characteristic of forest animal-eating species that typically take large prey, often by gleaning.Ongoing conservation work to restore forest fragments and retain native trees in coffee plantations should be highly beneficial for bats in this landscape. The maintenance of a mosaic landscape with sufficient patches of forest, shade-grown coffee and riparian corridors will help to maintain landscape wide functional diversity in an area dominated by tea plantations.'], ['Climate change adaptation has become an important aspect of research and policy agendas at different scales – globally, nationally and locally. One stream of thought relates to the thematic area of barriers or challenges that adaptation faces. This article explores local adaptation trajectories and challenges in a tribal development block in south India. Through the lens of key livelihood strategies pursued in the block – namely income from development interventions, migration and on-farm strategies – it explores the challenges and factors that contribute or have contributed, to impeding successful adaptation outcomes in Attappady. The article argues that development interventions (i.e planned adaptations) have not succeeded in addressing structural causes of vulnerability; they have, however, provided an important coping mechanism. Migration is a socially and culturally differentiated phenomenon and is not a viable diversification option for the most vulnerable population segments in Attappady. Finally, it is found that recent on-farm adaptation strategies present a case of maladaptation that promote marginalisation and are ill-suited to the local ecological and cultural landscape.'], ['Saraca asoca (Roxb.) De Wilde (Caesalpiniaceae) is a highly traded IUCN red listed tree species used in Ayurvedic medicines for the treatment of various disorders, especially gynaecological problems. However, information about the genetic variations between populations and corresponding variation in specialized metabolites of S. asoca remains unclear. To address this issue, we analysed 11 populations of S. asoca with 106 accessions collected from Western Ghats of India using ISSR markers along with selected phytocompounds using RP-HPLC. Twenty primers were screened, out of which seven were selected for further analysis based on generation of clear polymorphic banding patterns. These seven ISSR primers produced 74 polymorphic loci. AMOVA showed 43% genetic variation within populations and 57% among the populations of S. asoca. To estimate the genetic relationships among S. asoca populations, UPGMA and Bayesian Models were constructed, which revealed two clusters of similar grouping patterns. However, excluding minor deviations, UPGMA and dissimilarity analysis showed close association of genotypes according to their geographical locations. Catechin (CAT), epicatechin (EPI) and gallic acid (GA) were quantified from bark and leaf samples of corresponding genotypes collected from 106 accessions. ROC plots depicted the sensitivity and specificity of the concentrations of tested phytocompounds at various cut-off points. Although, multiple logistic regression analysis predicted some association between few loci with GA, EPI and CAT, but PCA for phytochemical data failed to distinguish the populations. Overall, there were no significant trends observed to distinguish the populations based on these phytocompounds. Furthermore, the study advocates the delineate provenance regions of S. asoca genotypes/chemotype snapshots for in-situ conservation and ex-situ cultivation.'], ['From the ancient time, the Northeast part of India is rich in biodiversity because of its diverse topographic, climatic features.

Uttara Kannada district has the distinction of having highest forest cover in India. Forest ecosystems in the district have witnessed major transformations due to industrialization during the post-independence. Impact of developmental activities during the post-independence era, is evident from barren hill tops due to deforestation. The analysis of temporal spatial data acquired through space borne sensors highlights the decline of evergreen-semi evergreen forest cover from 67.73% (1973) to 32.08% (2013). The ad-hoc approaches adopted in the implementation of developmental projects in the ecologically sensitive regions has impaired the ecosystem services affecting the people’s livelihood. The changes in the landscape structure with LULC changes have altered the functional abilities of an ecosystem evident from lowered hydrological yield, disappearing perennial streams, higher instances of human–animal conflicts, declined ecosystem goods, etc. About 64355\\xa0Ha of forest land is diverted for various non-forestry activities during the last four decades by the government apart from encroachment of 7072\\xa0Ha of forest area for agriculture, horticulture activities, etc. Encroachment of forest land has resulted in the land degradation leading to reduced productivity. Alterations in bio-geo chemical and hydrological cycles have necessitated the restoration of native forests in the region to ensure water and food security, and livelihood of the local people. Monitoring and visualization of landscape dynamics helps in evolving appropriate management strategies. LULC dynamics analyses considering agents (developmental projects) through fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) integrated with Markov cellular automata (CA) indicate the developmental projects such as West Coast Paper Mill (WCPM) and Kaiga Nuclear Power House (KNPH) will lead to further fragmentation of forests with spurt in urbanization by 2022.

A consensus in this regard is yet to be derived for its definition. Human intervention for its developmental activities results in several environmental changes that enhance some species, ecosystem and ecological processes while at the same time brings irrecoverable damage to the Planet Earth. It is essential and crucial to focus research and scientific analysis and establish awareness and education to provide a means of distinguishing responses between improvements in quality of ecosystem and those of damages. The focus of this paper is to emphasize the organized urban planning at a macro level and the architectural design interventions at the micro level in Vijayawada where eco – sensitivity exists with due consideration to ecological integrity and environmental protection. The ecological dynamics of continuity indicated that hillocks of Vijayawada region are a part of Eastern Ghats. The study is to elaborate that the landscape, eco-patches and its connectivity establishes a unique corridor to strengthen ecological system and as a green corridor to Vijayawada city to fulfill the demands of the city and also to create the ecological patch connectivity to scattered Eastern Ghats especially in the Krishna-Guntur region which connects the Nallamala hills through Kondapalli hill toward Sothern side and to the Papikondalu at the northern side of Eastern Ghats. These corridors may even support environmental conservation and provides rural edge in urban context and functions as lung spaces to ease the heat island effect of urban settlement. So the explicit development controls have been derived to guide and organize at micro level so as to achieve the macro level considerations of ecological integrity.'], ['Intensification of multispecies coffee agroforests reduces shade tree diversity with implications for tropical biodiversity.We investigated how tree biodiversity and its effects on coffee production and quality changes along a gradient of intensification (from diverse multispecies to Grevillea robusta dominated shade) across 25 Coffea canephora agroforests in Kodagu, India.Intensification causes a marked reduction in tree biodiversity (Shannon’s diversity: 2.74 to 0.29). Reduced tree diversity negatively affected both coffee production and quality (in terms of bean size), and increased incidences of pest attack, the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei). These results were consistent across a broad rainfall gradient (1060\\xa0mm\\xa0yr−1 to 4370\\xa0mm\\xa0yr−1) and management systems (conventional vs. organic farming and irrigation).Our results reveal important co-benefits of multispecies agroforestry systems for biodiversity conservation and coffee production. Nonetheless, intensification provides farmers with new livelihood options and income sources. To maintain high diversity agroforests, these opportunity costs need to be accounted for in developing realistic market strategies for biodiversity conservation.'], ['Forest reserves are increasingly becoming isolated, embedded in a matrix of various kinds of human land-use. Coffee plantations form the dominant matrix around many forest reserves in the tropics. In such a situation, the species richness and abundance of animals in coffee plantations can be expected to be determined by their proximity to the forest reserve and characteristics of the local vegetation. We tested this hypothesis with data on mammals (excluding bats, murids and insectivores) collected from 15 coffee plantations around the Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary in the Western Ghats mountain ranges in India, between December 2005 and May 2006. We estimated mammal species richness and abundance from indirect evidence in belt transects and track plots, and from sightings during night surveys. We sampled the vegetation of the plantations from 36 plots of 5\\xa0m\\xa0×\\xa05\\xa0m, in each estate. Twenty-eight species of mammals were recorded from 15 plantations. The number of species recorded in individual estates ranged from 5 to 19, with an average of 11.8. Distance from the Sanctuary was the most important factor that negatively influenced species richness, and the abundance of many species. Local vegetation characteristics influenced only the abundance of some small species. Coffee plantations can be a buffer around forest reserves and improve connectivity between them. However, increasing conversion of native shade into silver oak and hunting are two issues that must be addressed if coffee plantations are to form high-quality matrix around forest reserves in the Western Ghats.'], ['Spatial information at the landscape scale is extremely important for conservation planning, especially in the case of long-ranging vertebrates. The biodiversity-rich Anamalai hill ranges in the Western Ghats of southern India hold a viable population for the long-term conservation of the Asian elephant. Through rapid but extensive field surveys we mapped elephant habitat, corridors, vegetation and land-use patterns, estimated the elephant population density and structure, and assessed elephant–human conflict across this landscape. GIS and remote sensing analyses indicate that elephants are distributed among three blocks over a total area of about 4600\\xa0km2. Approximately 92% remains contiguous because of four corridors; however, under 4000\\xa0km2 of this area may be effectively used by elephants. Nine landscape elements were identified, including five natural vegetation types, of which tropical moist deciduous forest is dominant. Population density assessed through the dung count method using line transects covering 275\\xa0km of walk across the effective elephant habitat of the landscape yielded a mean density of 1.1 (95% CI\\xa0=\\xa00.99–1.2)\\xa0elephant/km2. Population structure from direct sighting of elephants showed that adult male elephants constitute just 2.9% and adult females 42.3% of the population with the rest being sub-adults (27.4%), juveniles (16%) and calves (11.4%). Sex ratios show an increasing skew toward females from juvenile (1:1.8) to sub-adult (1:2.4) and adult (1:14.7) indicating higher mortality of sub-adult and adult males that is most likely due to historical poaching for ivory. A rapid questionnaire survey and secondary data on elephant–human conflict from forest department records reveals that villages in and around the forest divisions on the eastern side of landscape experience higher levels of elephant–human conflict than those on the western side; this seems to relate to a greater degree of habitat fragmentation and percentage farmers cultivating annual crops in the east. We provide several recommendations that could help maintain population viability and reduce elephant–human conflict of the Anamalai elephant landscape.'], ['he hydrological research has largely concentrated on two extremes – undisturbed forest cover versus cleared forest land, whereas most tropical forest areas are now a mix of secondary vegetation, and old forest interspersed with patches cleared for agriculture or other non-forest use (Bruijnzeel, 2004; Giambelluca, 2002). For this reason, research on spatiotemporal variations in the effects of a mix of primary forest, mature secondary forests and disturbed forests on stream water quality was conducted in four watersheds in the Western Ghats of peninsular India. The study indicated that every one percent decrease in the forest cover (all lands with tree cover of canopy density of 10% and above when projected vertically on the horizontal ground with minimum areal extent of one ha) increases turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS) and Escherichia coli by 8.41%, 4.17% and 3.91%, respectively as also decreases calcium hardness by 0.49%. However, when the forest cover was segregated into old forests (primary forest, mature secondary forest and undisturbed mature plantations) and, open and disturbed forests the old forests were observed to significantly improve (p\\xa0<\\xa00.05) most water quality parameters. In contrast the open and disturbed forests were observed to deteriorate the observed water quality parameters except for turbidity and TSS. The magnitudes of regression coefficients indicated that the old forests were 2.2 and 2.74 times more effective than the disturbed forests in reducing turbidity and TSS, respectively. Tradeoffs between the provisioning services and water quality improvement services of the forest were apparent.'], [\"Species diversity and density of trees were assessed in four 1-ha plots (at 457–925 m in elevation) in the Eastern Ghats of the Andhra Pradesh region comprising mostly of tropical deciduous forests based on a census of all trees with girth at breast height ≥ 15cm. We compared tree community characteristics like stem density, basal area, diversity, and species composition of four plots using a tree dataset of eight belt transects (5\\xa0m\\xa0×\\xa01000\\xa0m) in the study area. A total of 2,227 individuals of 44 families, 98 genera, and 129 species were recorded. Combretaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Anacardiaceae, showed the greatest importance value index. It was noticed that the most species were contributed by Euphorbiaceae and the tree density varied from 435 ha–1 to 767 ha–1 with an average basal area of 25.82\\xa0m2/ha. Shannon–Weiner index (H') ranged from 3.76 to 3.96, the Simpson index ranged from 0.96 to 0.97, evenness index ranged from 0.60 to 0.78, and species richness index ranged from 10.04 to 11.24. At present the biodiversity of these forests are under threat due to the anthropogenic and upcoming mining activities. The present study will help us to understand the patterns of tree species composition and diversity in the Eastern Ghats of India.\"], ['Tropical montane habitats, including the Shola Sky Islands in the Western Ghats, host several threatened taxa of which, the global distributions are restricted to these mountain-tops. The rapidly increasing human footprint and the spread of invasive alien plants have already resulted in the local extinction of several taxa. Here we examine the entire Shola Sky Islands ecosystem to estimate the extent of habitat loss and to create a baseline of land use in this rapidly changing landscape. We used LANDSAT imageries from 1973, 1995 and 2017, with 840 ground truth points across the ecosystem. We find substantial landscape modification in the large high elevation plateaus (7–60%) over the last four decades while changes are muted in the other parts. The loss of grasslands to exotic trees predominates (340\\u202fkm2, 23%) the modification of this landscape, and, continues today at a rapid pace. Contrary to popular belief, Shola Forests have been relatively stable, implying that most plantations were established on grasslands—traditionally classified as “unproductive wastelands”. Across the Protected Area (PA) network, Reserve Forests (RF), the least protected areas have faced the greatest loss of grasslands. Older PAs have lost relatively fewer grasslands, but the invasion from adjoining RFs is now increasing. We highlight the complexity of conservation in this landscape with three case studies of PAs with different management histories. Our study highlights the rapid loss of native Shola Grasslands, the continuing loss to invasive exotic trees, and the challenges of conserving this critical habitat with traditional modes of conservation.'], [\"This large-scale, landscape-level study aims to assess tree species diversity, stem density and stand structure of six major tropical hill forests of southern Eastern Ghats, India, namely, Bodamalai (BM), Chitteri (CH), Kalrayan (KA), Kolli hills (KO), Pachaimalai (PM) and Shervarayan hills (SH). The Eastern Ghats of India is relatively under-studied compared with the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. The entire stretch of southern Eastern Ghats was divided into smaller grids of 6.25\\xa0km\\xa0×\\xa06.25\\xa0km, totaling to 120 grids. Within each grid, a belt transect of 0.5\\xa0ha (5\\xa0m\\xa0×\\xa01000\\xa0m) area was laid and all trees ≥30\\xa0cm girth at breast height (gbh) were enumerated. A total of 272 tree species (≥30\\xa0cm gbh) that belonged to 181 genera and 62 families were recorded in the total 60\\xa0ha area inventoried. Diversity indices such as Shannon, Simpson and Fisher's alpha indices were 2.44, 0.03 and 42.1, respectively, for the whole 60\\xa0ha area. One way ANOVA revealed that the species richness varied significantly across the six sites (F(5,823)\\xa0=\\xa04.854, p\\xa0<\\xa00.0002). Also, the contribution of tree species to total species richness classified by three plant types viz. evergreen, brevi-deciduous and deciduous species varied significantly across the sites (One way ANOVA: F(2,15)\\xa0=\\xa010.05, p\\xa0<\\xa00.002). Similarity indices such as Jaccard and Sørensen showed that sites CH and KA are more similar in terms of species composition. The total stand density and basal area for the total 60\\xa0ha area were 27,412 stems (457\\xa0stems\\xa0ha−1) and 1012.12\\xa0m2 (16.9\\xa0m2\\xa0ha−1), respectively. The stand density and basal area for the six sites ranged from 290 (in site BM) to 527\\xa0stems\\xa0ha−1 (in site KA) and from 5.6 (in site BM) to 24.4\\xa0m2\\xa0ha−1 (in site KO), respectively. Stand density and basal area of tree species varied significantly across the six hill complexes (F(5,823)\\xa0=\\xa04.85, p\\xa0<\\xa00.0002 and F(5,823)\\xa0=\\xa02.71, p\\xa0<\\xa00.02, respectively). A positive correlation was obtained between stand density and species richness in sites PM (rs\\xa0=\\xa00.65, p\\xa0<\\xa00.05) and SH (rs\\xa0=\\xa00.67, p\\xa0<\\xa00.05), but not in other sites. The predominant tree species in the tropical forests of southern Eastern Ghats include Albizia amara, Euphorbia antiquorum, Canthium dicoccum var. dicoccum, Memecylon edule, Chloroxylon swietenia and Nothopegia heyneana. Taxonomically, Euphorbiaceae constituted the most diverse family with 25 species. Whereas, by tree abundance the Mimosaceae with 4126 stems enumerated from the 60\\xa0ha area formed the dominant family. Bray–Curtis cluster analysis, based on tree species composition and abundance revealed that the low-diverse site BM formed a separate entity from other hill complexes. This large-scale tree diversity inventory provides a baseline data for a variety of investigations and is expected to be useful for effective forest management and biodiversity conservation of southern Eastern Ghats region.\"], ['Nilgirianthus ciliatus is of interest for its extensive applications in Ayurvedic medicine. The study focuses on the assessment of genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships in N. ciliatus populations to aid conservation of this species at risk of extinction. Thirty five inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) and thirty random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were employed in PCR yielding 298 and 99 bands, respectively. Using ISSR markers, bands of 200–3500 bp were obtained and accounted for 77.0% of polymorphism observed. The polymorphism information content (PIC) and resolving power (Rp) values were 0.59 and 20.8, respectively. RAPD analysis resulted in 99 total bands of which 89 were polymorphic (89.9%). The PIC value for RAPD was 0.61 and Rp value was 18.8. The two different cluster analyses (UPGMA and Neighbor Joining) and principal component analysis showed the genetic variation among the populations. Clustering of N. ciliatus populations from different geographical regions in distinct groups can be a good sign for clear separation that is supported by high bootstrap values. Overall, both ISSR and RAPD analyses were valuable for identifying genetic variations and phylogenetic relationships in N. ciliatus populations at the DNA level and these differences provides the basic knowledge for better conservation management policies and genetic identification of the different geographical populations of this plant.'], ['tion conflicts represent complex multilayered problems that are challenging to study. We explore the utility of theoretical, experimental, and constructivist approaches to games to help to understand and manage these challenges. We show how these approaches can help to develop theory, understand patterns in conflict, and highlight potentially effective management solutions. The choice of approach should be guided by the research question and by whether the focus is on testing hypotheses, predicting behaviour, or engaging stakeholders. Games provide an exciting opportunity to help to unravel the complexity in conflicts, while researchers need an awareness of the limitations and ethical constraints involved. Given the opportunities, this field will benefit from greater investment and development.'], [\"Forest-agricultural ecotones are defined as areas that adjoin forests and other natural habitats and that lie between forests and zones of intensive agriculture. These ecotones are critical for conservation of biodiversity and for the maintenance of livelihoods of people that inhabit these areas. Here we focus on three questions: (1) How can we make land use sustainable in forest-agriculture ecotones? (2) How can forest-agriculture ecotones contribute to conservation of biodiversity? (3) How can we improve the institutions that foster sustainability and conservation of biodiversity in forest-agriculture ecotones? We address these questions in the context of interventions to foster biodiversity and rural livelihoods made by the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bangalore, in the Western Ghats and the Eastern Himalayas, 2 of the 34 global hotspots of biodiversity in India. At several sites, ATREE's interventions have improved the livelihoods of several rural communities by providing increased income from non-timber forest products (NTFPs), diversification of livelihoods and enhanced agricultural production. These interventions have improved the prospects for sustainable land use in the forest-agriculture ecotones. Simultaneously, ATREE's interventions have strengthened a range of village level and regional institutions that play a critical role in the rural economy and in conservation of biodiversity. We believe that the path to sustainability in agriculture as well as maintenance of biodiversity passes through adaptive, strong and relevant institutions. The development of institutions however is severely constrained by low social and human capital and the neglect of forest-agriculture ecotones by the governmental agencies and international organizations. We argue that forest-agriculture ecotones offer a means to conserve biodiversity through alleviation of poverty and development of community-based institutions.\"], ['The structure, function, and ecosystem services of tropical forest depend on its species richness, diversity, dominance, and the patterns of changes in the assemblages of tree populations over time. Long-term data from permanent vegetation plots have yielded a wealth of data on the species diversity and dynamics of tree populations, but such studies have only rarely been undertaken in tropical forest landscapes that support large human populations. Thus, anthropogenic drivers and their impacts on species diversity and community structure of tropical forests are not well understood. Here we present data on species diversity, community composition, and regeneration status of tropical forests in a human-dominated landscape in the Western Ghats of southern India. Enumeration of 40 plots (50\\xa0m\\xa0×\\xa020\\xa0m) results a total of 106 species of trees, 76 species of saplings and 79 species of seedlings. Detrended Correspondence Analysis ordination of the tree populations yielded five dominant groups, along disturbance and altitudinal gradients on the first and second axes respectively. Abundant species of the area such as Albizia amara, Nothopegia racemosa and Pleiospermum alatum had relatively few individuals in recruiting size classes. Our data indicate probable replacement of rare, localized, and old-growth ‘specialists’ by disturbance-adapted generalists, if the degradation is continuing at the present scale.'], ['Kundapallam watershed is located in Nilgiris District of south India. This ungauged watershed has an areal extension of 14.37 km2. There are increasing numbers of rainfall induced landslide occurrences in this area. The causes of rainfall induced landslides require a thorough understanding of runoff characteristics of the watershed. In this respect, the runoff of the study area is estimated with two approaches such as modified Soil Conservation Curve Number (SCS-CN) and Green-Ampt loss method. By these approaches, the related thematic factors on runoff characteristics are prepared with satellite images by using ARCGIS and IDRISI image processing software. The catchment delineation is generated for the Kundapallam watershed to get watershed parameters by using HEC-GeoHMS extension in ARCGIS. Curve number is assigned based on Soil Wetness Index (SWI). Sixteen soil samples were collected from different localities for the determination of hydraulic conductivity, moisture content, wetting front capillary pressure, bulk density, porosity etc. The infiltration rate of sample locations is determined by using double ring infiltrometer. Then all the parameters are assigned to models applied in this study to determine runoff characteristics of the study area. The accuracy and goodness of fit of the model are tested by determining the correlation coefficient (SCS-CN = 0.979 and Green-Ampt = 0.985) and coefficient determination (SCS-CN = 0.958 and Green-Ampt = 0.97) and it indicates statically positive correlations and perfect fit between the results of the study. The results showed that the modified SCS-CN provides low runoff estimation compared than Green-Ampt loss method.'], ['Night frogs (Nyctibatrachidae) form a family endemic to the Western Ghats, a hill chain along the west coast of southern India. Extant members of this family are descendants of a lineage that originated on the subcontinent during its longtime isolation in the Late Cretaceous. Because the evolutionary history of Nyctibatrachidae has always been tightly connected to the subcontinent, these tropically-adapted frogs are an ideal group for studying how patterns of endemism originated and evolved during the Cenozoic in the Western Ghats. We used a combined set of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA fragments to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of 120 ingroup specimens of all known species of Nyctibatrachidae. Our analyses indicate that, although this family had an early origin on the Indian subcontinent, the early diversification of extant nyctibatrachids happened only in the Eocene. Biogeographic analyses show that dispersal across the Palghat gap and Shencottah gap was limited, which led to clade endemism within mountain ranges of the Western Ghats. It is likely that multiple biota have been affected simultaneously by these prominent geographical barriers. Our study therefore further highlights the importance of considering the Western Ghats–Sri Lanka biodiversity hotspot as an assemblage of distinct mountain regions, each containing endemism and deserving attention in future conservation planning.'], ['Economic valuation of ecosystem benefits and their aggregation in a benefit–cost analysis (BCA) framework is the norm in mainstream environmental economics. But valuation and BCA have also attracted criticisms. ‘Internal’ criticisms point to the absence of alternative scenarios in valuation, overlooking of ecological trade-offs and dis-services, and inattention to context. Others criticize aggregation across diverse stakeholders and the problem of non-monetizable benefits, and dismiss BCA as fatally flawed. They suggest approaches such as deliberative decision-making and multi-criteria analysis. We propose a middle path that uses the strengths of economic analysis for decision support while avoiding the pitfalls. We disaggregate economic impacts by stakeholder groups, link ecosystem changes to benefits as well as dis-benefits, and examine how socio-technological context shapes the magnitude of economic impact. We illustrate this approach by studying the impact of creating the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple wildlife sanctuary in the Western Ghats forests of southern India. Our analysis shows that while some stakeholders are net beneficiaries, others are net losers. Changes in forest rights, irrigation technologies, and ecosystem dynamics influence the magnitude of benefits and sometimes convert gainers into losers. Such disaggregated analysis can provide useful information for deliberative decision-making and important academic insights on how economic value is generated.'], ['We analyzed mycorrhizal types and dark septate endophyte (DSE) fungal associations in a shola vegetation of Western Ghats region, southern India. Plants belonging to 29 species of 19 families were assessed for mycorrhizal type and DSE fungal association. Five mycorrhizal classes were classified based on morphological traits: arbuscular, ecto-, ectendo-, ericoid-, and orchid mycorrhizas. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) association was the most predominant mycorrhizal type, occurring in 16 plant species, followed by orchid (3 species), ericoid- (2 species), and ecto- and ectendomycorrhizas (1 species each). Mycorrhizal association is reported for the first time in 19 plant species. DSE fungal association was found in six plant species. Arum- and Paris-type AM morphology was found, respectively, in 10 and 5 plant species, with intermediate type recorded in one species. In this study, some new records on the morphological types of AM in some plant families were obtained. Further occurrence of ectendomycorrhizas in Pinus oocarpa and dark septate fungal association in Eleaocarpus munronii, Symplocos cochinchiensis, Daphniphyllum neilgherrense, Euodia roxburghiana, Syzygium arnottianum, and Syzygium montanum are reported for the first time. Roots of Berberis tinctoria, Mahonia leschenaultii (Berberidaceae), Elaeagnus latifolia (Elaeagnaceae), and Elaeocarpus oblongus (Elaeocarpaceae) lacked any fungal structures.'], [\"Knowledge of the social structure of a population is important for a range of fundamental and applied purposes. Group characteristics and population structure of chital (Axis axis) and sambar (Rusa unicolor) were studied in a deciduous habitat of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, Western Ghats, India, during 2008–2009. Vehicle transects were monitored monthly to gather information on group–size and age–sex composition of chital and sambar. The average mean group size and crowding for chital and sambar was 13.1\\xa0±\\xa00.5 (n\\xa0=\\xa01020), 3.6\\xa0±\\xa00.2 (n\\xa0=\\xa0377) and 33.3, 11.0 respectively. The average adult male:adult female:fawn ratio was 63.4:100:22.3 (n\\xa0=\\xa09391) and 43.9:100:23.7 (n\\xa0=\\xa01023) in chital and sambar respectively. The mean group size of chital and sambar varied significantly between seasons (Kruskal–Wallis test, p\\xa0=\\xa0<0.001). Peak fawning season was observed from February to May for chital and May to August for sambar. Group's sex–age composition influenced group formation in both species between seasons at different level. Adult male and fawn were the important predicting variables of change in group size. Skewed female sex ratio was probably due to selective male predation by large predators. Although fawning occurred throughout the year, both species showed seasonality in fawning. The above mentioned patterns differed between species depending upon their ecological adaptation in foraging strategies and habitat preference.\"], ['In the Western Ghats (South India), the natural evergreen forest has been highly disturbed and fragmented for 150 years. The resultant vegetation is a mosaic of more or less disturbed forests, pastures, and crops (mainly paddy fields). This paper aims to assess the effects of anthropic disturbance on earthworm communities. Earthworms were collected at the end of the rainy season in a wide range of milieux distinguished by their vegetation, soil properties and topography. The earthworms found belong to the families Octochaetidae, Megascolecidae and Moniligastridae. Densities ranged from 35.3 to 545.3 ind m−2. Biomasses ranged from 2.35 to 52.56 g m−2. There was no clear relationship between these community characteristics and the vegetation, soil properties or topography as pastures and forests supported high or low densities (or biomasses). Nevertheless, some species were restricted to pastures, some species to forests and some species are found in all milieux.'], ['here is comparatively limited information in the humid tropics on the surface and sub-surface permeability of: (i) forests which have been impacted by multi-decades of human occupancy and (ii) forestation of land in various states of degradation. Even less is known about the dominant stormflow pathways for these respective scenarios. We sampled field saturated hydraulic conductivity, K∗ at 23 sites at four depths (0\\xa0m, n\\xa0=\\xa0166), (0.10\\xa0m, n\\xa0=\\xa0139), 0.45–0.60\\xa0m, n\\xa0=\\xa0117, (1.35–1.50\\xa0m, n\\xa0=\\xa0117) under less disturbed forest (Forest), disturbed production forest of various local species (Degraded Forest) and tree-plantations (Acacia auriculiformes, 7–10\\xa0years old, Tectona grandis, ∼25–30\\xa0years old, Casuarina equisetifolia, 12\\xa0years old) in the Uttar Kannada district, Karnataka, India, in the Western Ghats. The sampling strategy was also undertaken across three physiographic blocks and under three main soil types. Subsequently the determined K∗ were then linked with rainfall intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) characteristics to infer the dominant stormflow pathways.The Degraded Forest shows an order of magnitude decline in K∗ at the surface as result of human impacts at decadal to century time scales. The lowest surface permeability is associated with the Degraded Forests over the Laterite (Eutric Nitosols and Acrisols) and Red soils (Eutric Nitosols) and infiltration-excess overland flow, IOF probably occurs. Further there is a progressive decline in K∗ with depth in these soils supporting Degraded Forests. The A. auriculiformes plantations over the Red and Lateritic soils are progressively restoring the near-surface K∗, but their K∗ still remain quite low when compared to the less disturbed forest permeability. Consequently these plantations still retain the ‘memory’ from the previous degraded state. In contrast the permeability of the Black soils (Vertisols) are relatively insensitive to T. grandis plantations and this soil group has a very low K∗, irrespective of land cover, so that IOF likely prevails. Overall, the Laterites are the most variable in K∗ when compared to the other soil groups. Thus when compared to other studies, IOF is probably more prevalent in this region. More especially so, when taking into account the marked reduction in surface K∗ during the wet season when compared to dry season measurements. In addition, we have demonstrated the potential for the ‘infiltration – trade-off’ hypothesis to be realized in this landscape under certain conditions of land degradation and restoration. It is most relevant to the combination of degraded sites and A. auriculiformes plantations on Red or Laterite soils using the less disturbed forests as the baseline. The intensity of forest use and effects of monoculture plantations on soil ecology (relative to native, mixed forests) is likely to be the critical factor in affecting surface K∗ over time. Predicted changes in the intensity of rain events in the future is likely to enhance overland flow on degraded sites on all soils and especially on Black soils, and restoration efforts by all stake-holders, preferably using native or non-invasive species, are needed to address this concern.'], ['The Western Ghats in India is one of the 25 global hotspots of biodiversity, and it is the hotspot with the highest human density. This study considers variations in the regional fire regime that are related to vegetation type and past human disturbances in a landscape. Using a combination of remote sensing data and GIS techniques, burnt areas were delineated in three different vegetation types and various metrics of fire size were estimated. Belt transects were enumerated to assess the vegetation characteristics and fire effects in the landscape. Temporal trends suggest increasingly short fire-return intervals in the landscape. In the tropical dry deciduous forest, the mean fire-return interval is 6 years, in the tropical dry thorn forest mean fire-return interval is 10 years, and in the tropical moist deciduous forest mean fire-return interval is 20 years. Tropical dry deciduous forests burned more frequently and had the largest number of fires in any given year as well as the single largest fire (9900\\xa0ha). Seventy percent, 56%, and 30% of the tropical moist deciduous forests, tropical dry thorn forests, and tropical dry deciduous forests, respectively have not burned during the 7-year period of study. The model of fire-return interval as a function of distance from park boundary explained 63% of the spatial variation of fire-return interval in the landscape. Forest fires had significant impacts on species diversity and regeneration in the tropical dry deciduous forests. Species diversity declined by 50% and 60% in the moderate and high frequency classes, respectively compared to the low fire frequency class. Sapling density declined by ca. 30% in both moderate and high frequency classes compared to low frequency class. In tropical moist deciduous ecosystems, there were substantial declines in species diversity, tree density, seedling and sapling densities in burned forests compared to the unburned forests. In contrast forest fires in tropical dry thorn forests had a marginal positive effect on ecosystem diversity, structure, and regeneration.'], ['The Kandivalasa River Sub Basin near Cheepurupalli town of Vizianagaram district, Andhra Pradesh, India was monitored for groundwater levels at 41 observation wells during 2013–2015. Along with groundwater levels, the daily rainfall data is also collected for these years. A continuous decrease in groundwater levels was observed during the study period more particularly in the year 2015 which also had minimum rainfall. Groundwater depletion is observed mostly in the Eastern and South Western part of the basin where pumping wells are more. Groundwater balance studies have indicated that 11.3 MCM of groundwater can be utilized in the basin annually. However, the net annual groundwater draft has been found to be 16.6 MCM. Hence, over abstraction of 5.66 MCM is the main cause for depletion of groundwater levels.

Calamus nambariensis Becc. has been recognized as endemic and threatened cane to the North East region of India. The plant is restricted to only two pockets of Assam with a poor population size. Therefore, conservation of this plant through proper scientific investigation is utmost necessary. The present investigation has as its objectives to study the distribution, estimation of population size, standardization of suitable micropropagation methods for reintroduction and reinforcement in suitable wild habitat as determined by ecological niche modelling (ENM) for the purposes of conservation. For improving the conservation status of the species, potential area and habitat for reintroduction was determined using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) distribution modelling algorithm. The population size in both the site was found to be very poor i.e., mean density, frequency of occurrence and abundance in relation to other associated species was 0.600, 29.26 and 2.307 in Nambor Reserve Forest whereas 0.526, 27.407 and 2.112 respectively in Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary. Macropropagation of C. nambariensis was standardized here through seed germination which was found to be more efficient in terms of time and cost which revealed 87% germination in treated seeds, followed by 61% only for untreated seeds till 90\\xa0days. It was also observed that seedlings in the hilly slope of Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary (reinforcement) showed high survivability than that of the hilly slop of Lahorijan Reserve Forest (reintroduction). Further, survival rate was measured for 24\\xa0months, which revealed significantly very high on an average of 97.85% in both the locations, while 1200 numbers of C. nambariensis plantlets were transferred to the field. The present study could change the population size of C. nambariensis in its natural habitat, proving effective means for preventing extinction and improving conservation status of the plant.'], ['As pressure from a growing human population increases around the world, greater levels of conflict between people and wildlife over shrinking available land may be inevitable. The conversion of Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary to Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) in India is a conservation initiative under “Project Tiger” scheme to facilitate greater habitat connectivity across the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. We interviewed local people in the MTR landscape to determine their interest and attitude towards resettlement and tiger conservation following MTR’s new status designation. We found that non-tribal Mountain Chetties generally had negative attitude towards tiger conservation, Kurumbas were positive toward the idea, and Kattunaickers, and Irula people and other minor ethnic groups were found neutral. We found that literate respondents were less likely to collect firewood and more likely to exhibit positive attitude towards tiger conservation and the establishment of MTR. Households with higher milk production, and people with generally negative attitude towards wildlife conservation, were against the declaration of MTR. People employed in private sectors and those having negative perception towards wildlife conservation were more likely to show negative attitude towards declaration of MTR. Locals desiring resettlement post MTR declaration were literate, and interested in availing better livelihood resources. However, they usually suffered relatively high livestock loss to large carnivores, and high crop damage caused by elephant (Elephas maximus). Most respondents (74.3%) were interested in resettlement provided that basic amenities were available to them. We recommend that conservation authorities facilitate “choice-based resettlement” options, which account for local people’s consent before making decisions on “resettlement”. This approach will avoid possible conflicts between forest managers and local people.'], ['The lantern flowers (genus: Ceropegia L. — Apocynaceae) are among the most fascinating group of flowering plants which comprises of over 200 species of herbs and climbers. Although most of the species have appreciable importance as a source of edible tubers, ornamental flowers and implications in folk medicine, the conventional propagation techniques limit the mass propagation and their commercialization. Plant tissue culture and other biotechnological tools proved their importance in breeding and large-scale propagation of lantern flowers. In recent past, numerous in vitro regeneration approaches for micropropagation and conservation have been established for lantern flowers. Molecular markers represent powerful tools for constructing phylogenetics, taxonomic confirmations and reconsiderations of lantern flowers. Moreover, molecular markers are routinely used for ascertaining genetic integrity among the micropropagated clones of lantern flowers. This review provides comprehensive information on the biotechnological interventions for propagation, conservation, and improvement of lantern flowers. Protocols for various in vitro regeneration approaches, genetic composition, genetic fidelity analysis and in vitro secondary metabolite production are compared and optimized results are highlighted.'], ['The endangered Nilgiri tahr Hemitragus hylocrius is endemic to the Western Ghats mountains in south India. The largest existing population inhabits the Anamalai conservation unit (Anamalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary, and Eravikulam National Park) straddling the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. We undertook a survey to assess the conservation status of Nilgiri tahr in the Anamalai-Parambikulam area of the conservation unit. Altogether, 348 tahr were sighted in 12 separate grassland areas, including two populations which had not been recorded previously. The present population of Nilgiri tahr in Anamalai and Parambikulam sanctuaries is estimated to be between 570 and 690 animals. Together with the Eravikulam population, the Anamalai conservation unit therefore contains some 1400 Nilgiri tahr. We found evidence of poaching in five of the 12 areas surveyed. Tahr habitat is also threatened by the spread of wattle Acacia mearnsii in one area, and by extensive livestock grazing in another. Comparisons are made with the successful conservation measures taken in Eravikulam and recommendations made for control of poaching in Anamalai–Parambikulam area.'], ['Earth is undergoing unprecedented urban growth, with urban areas forecasted to increase by 120\\u202fmillion\\u202fha from 2000 to 2030, impacting natural habitat. However, to date it is unclear where conservation investments can best mitigate biodiversity loss due to urban expansion into natural habitat. Here we combine spatially-explicit global forecasts of urban expansion, information on terrestrial vertebrate endemism, and data on current land cover and protected areas to define conservation priorities. Globally, 13% of endemics are in ecoregions under high threat from urban expansion. Biodiversity losses are highly spatially concentrated, with 78% of endemics threatened by urban growth occurring in just 30 priority ecoregions (4% of all ecoregions). Natural habitat protection of 4.1–8.0\\u202fmillion\\u202fha, <7% of total forecasted urban expansion, would be needed in these priority ecoregions. As an added benefit, such protection would also reduce GHG emissions by an amount worth up to 87.6 billion USD.'], ['The high altitude ferruginous Alfisols associated spatially with shrink–swell soils on the Deccan basalt plateau and dissected table lands in the Western Ghats of India were analysed for their morphological, chemical and mineralogical properties with a view to comprehend their formation and persistence in the tropical humid climate prevailing since the early Tertiary. The study indicates that despite their acidic pH the soils have high bases and their clay fractions are dominated by interstratified smectite-kaolin. The persistence of these non-kaolinitic and/or non-oxidic Alfisols has been possible due to the presence of base-rich zeolites of amygdoloidal basalt. It suggests that for an open system such as soil, the existence of steady state is a more meaningful concept than thermodynamic equilibrium. The knowledge gained on the role of zeolites in soils provides a check on the reasoning of models on the formation of soils in tropical humid climate. The study also indicates that the supply of bases from zeolites can prevent the soils from losing their productivity even in intense leaching environment.'], ['In tropical forest conservation, areas with full statutory protection are often surrounded by buffer zones. Information on the patterns of tree community structure differences in these zones is helpful to evaluate the conservation efficacy. Our study was implemented within a biodiversity hotspot, in the Ta Xua Nature Reserve of north-western Vietnam, which has a statutorily protected core zone and a buffer zone, where local H’Mong people are permitted low intensity forest use. The forests are rich in tree species (249 observed). Many of these tree species provide non-timber forest products (NTFPs) (48%) or valuable timber (22%), and 18 species are red-listed. Overall tree density was not different in the two zones, but tree diameter and species richness were lower in the buffer zone. At the tree level, logistic regression analysis indicated that red-listed status, large diameter, and low density of conspecifics increased the probability of tree absence from the buffer zone but not the potential use as a NTFP. However, most NTFP species had different densities in the core and buffer zones, and this correlated with signs of human interference. At the species level, the density of species was the most important variable, and rarity strongly increased the probability of species absence. Our results also indicate that rare and red-listed trees were depleted in the buffer zone. In consideration of conservation goals, the future monitoring of these species at the Ta Xua Nature Reserve and other protected areas is needed, and conservation measures most likely need to be improved.'], ['There is an increased interest in identifying the status of biodiversity in different spatial and temporal scales. The objective of the current research is to prepare a consistent spatial database of intact forest landscapes of India. The intact forest landscapes are located in the Himalayas, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Western Ghats and Sunderbans. At national level 237 forest landscapes and 5.4% of the total natural forest remained as intact in India. Current intact forest landscapes of India consists of blocks larger than 10\\xa0km2 covering an area of 34,061\\xa0km2. Of the total area under intact forest landscapes, Eastern Himalayas represent 76.7% of the area, followed by Western Himalayas (8.8%), Andaman & Nicobar Islands (6.2%) and Western Ghats (5.7%). The largest intact forest landscape block occupies an area of 3342.9\\xa0km2 (9.8%) is found in western Arunachal Pradesh. Temperate forest zone represents the highest intactness (56.6%), followed by subtropical zone (19.2%), tropical zone (18.6%) and alpine zone (5.6%). Himalayan moist temperate forests represent the highest area (39.1%) of intact forest landscapes followed by subtropical broad-leaved hill forests, wet evergreen forests, and montane wet temperate forests. It is estimated that 4.4% of the area of intact forest landscapes fall inside the existing 47 protected areas. The results of the analysis best suited as input for the process of identification of new protected areas. The study recommends fine-scale mapping of biodiversity within the intact forest landscapes and to prepare efficient conservation plans.'], ['Soppina Betta Forests (SBFs; foliage forests) are minor forests allowed by the State for the Areca-grower’s use as organic support in the Western Ghats area of Karnataka, South India. Sustainable utilization of these for foliage and litter (to make composted leaf-manure) and firewood (to boil Areca nuts before drying) would ensure the farmer to stand on his own and prevent him from unduly pressurizing the State Forests. Ten hamlets in Sringeri area of the Western Ghats were selected at random, from each of which nearly 10 farmers were interviewed by PRA technique for a socio-economic survey of the purpose, benefits and management of their individual SBFs. One representative SBF from each of the 10 hamlets was taken up for phytosociological survey and the results were compared with a natural forest benchmark selected nearby. Species diversity at all levels was higher in the SBFs than in the natural forest. Stand densities too were higher, but basal coverages were lower. The farmers were found to promote select species like Aporosa lindleyana, Memecylon umbellatum, Syzygium cumini and S. caryophyllatum for their foliage requirements. The benefits derived, lopping patterns, protection and planting attitudes of the farmers were marked with a differentiating scheme and the relative scores on these four heads of management attributes were summed up into a management value index (MVI). MVI was found to increase with the Areca-landholding status of the farmers, and optimization of the MVI was observed at an Areca-landholding to SBF ratio of 1\\xa0:\\xa01.5–2.5 for the low (0–1\\xa0ha), intermediate (1–2\\xa0ha) and rich (>2\\xa0ha) Areca-landholding categories. The optimization was most pronounced for the low landholding group of farmers. The average size-class distribution of tree species individuals of the 10 SBFs described the expected L-shaped curve similar to that of the natural forest, but possessed larger number of individuals in most of the size-classes.'], [\"Interference competition by tigers, Panthera tigris, is widely reported to reduce leopard, Panthera pardus, density or cause its shift to more a marginal habitat. In Southeast Asia, lack of a medium sized prey, spotted deer (Axis axis), and increased consumption of sambar (Rusa unicolor) by leopards amplifies dietary overlap between these two large felids. In our study area in western Thailand, leopard density was 2.4 times that of tigers. Using scat analysis we estimated prey biomass in the diet of each species to examine resource competition between these species. Tigers had a 0.89 spatial overlap with leopards and leopards a 0.92 overlap with tigers. Larger prey in this system (>100\\u202fkg) composed 89.8 Ackerman's coefficient, ACF, and 79.3% Chakrabati's coefficient, CCF of the biomass in tiger diet and 47.0% (ACF) and 45.3% (CCF) of the biomass in leopard diet. Dietary overlap of prey >100\\u202fkg versus smaller prey (≤37\\u202fkg) between these felids was 74.4% (ACF) and 81.2% (CCF). Dense cover at our site may reduce interference competition from tigers. In turn, high leopard density and leopard consumption of young sambar likely increases resource competition with tigers and thus potentially reduces tiger density. Given current small tiger population sizes, it is important to recognize that leopards may compete with and potentially suppress tiger numbers at some locations throughout their range and this topic needs further study.\"], ['Scholars and advocates increasingly favor rights-based approaches over traditional exclusionary policies in conservation. Yet, national and international conservation policies and programs have often led to the exclusion of forest-dependent peoples. This article proposes and tests the hypothesis that the failures of rights-based approaches in conservation can be attributed in significant measure to the political economic interest of the state in the tropics. To this end, the article presents findings from the empirical analysis of the Forest Rights Act of 2006 in India. Two key recommendations emerge from this analysis. One, the proposals for operationalizing rights-based approaches will likely be far more effective if they protect the inalienability of a minimal set of rights critical to the subsistence and well-being of forest people, as opposed to promising the protection of an expansive set of rights subject to the instrumentality of conservation. Two, the proponents of rights-based approaches in conservation need to guard against their actions reinforcing the institutional status quo of the state control of forests. This, in turn, requires international conservation groups to join hands with national forest rights movements.'], ['Despite being one of the dominant groups in freshwater ecosystems, morphological and ontogenetic studies on aquatic Hemiptera have received little attention in the Oriental region. We present the ontogenetic trajectory and allometry of the widespread Oriental belostomatid species, Diplonychus rusticus (Fabricius) for the first time. We have measured nine different morphological variables throughout the growth of the bug using both field captured and laboratory reared specimens. Our results suggest that the developmental instars can be distinguished by the size variables, as seen in the Principal Component Analysis. On the basis of a CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection) based regression tree, we also show that the characters – total length without head and maximum width – prove to be adequate for effective instar identification. The multivariate allometric growth pattern shows that different body parts exhibit different types of allometry. This is apparent in the allometry exhibited by forelegs and mid and hind legs, which show allometry of opposite polarities. This may be due to the different functions attributed to these body parts. Our results show that the growth pattern in D.\\xa0rusticus is comparable with the New World genus Belostoma, suggesting a conserved growth pattern in the family Belostomatidae.'], ['Technological advancement has allowed for consideration of electronic monitoring (EM) as a tool for improving the accuracy of logbook data and/or increasing the quantity of fishery-dependent data collected. In Australia, an integrated EM system was implemented in several managed fisheries, including the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery (ETBF) and the Gillnet Hook and Trap (GHAT) sector of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) from 1 July 2015. We compare logbook data from the first two years of EM operation to the previous six years, to measure changes in reported nominal catch and discard per unit effort (CPUE and DPUE) and interactions with protected species per-unit-effort (IPUE). We observed no significant increase in CPUE between non-EM (2009–2014) and EM (2015 and 2016) years for any species group in both the ETBF and GHAT. In contrast, DPUE increased significantly during the EM years for target, byproduct and bycatch species in the ETBF and for target species in the GHAT sector. There was a significant increase in the IPUE for seabirds, marine mammals and turtles in the ETBF and for dolphins and pinnipeds in the GHAT sector. While not discounting possible environmentally-driven shifts in availability and abundance, as well as individual vessel effects, the weight of evidence suggests the use of an integrated EM system has led to significant changes in logbook reporting of discarded catch and protected species interactions, particularly in the ETBF. Assuming this supposition is valid, we identify fishery-specific factors that might have influenced reporting behaviour.'], ['Habitat fragmentation, land cover change and biodiversity loss are often associated with village communities in protected areas, but the extent and intensity of such impacts are often inadequately assessed. We record resource use and depletion by human inhabitants by conducting ecological surveys in six villages and social surveys in all 13 villages of varying sizes in India’s Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary (492\\xa0km2). We examined the occurrence of 10 regionally-specific ecological indicators that encompassed several aspects of human activities. Thirty transects with 180 total sampling locations recorded the occurrence of these specific habitat disturbance variables. High correlations between the variables led to the use of principal component analysis to derive an effective summary index that reflected disturbance intensity and determined village ecological impacts spatially. A generalized linear model was fit to determine the rate at which disturbance decreases as we move away from village centers. Our model indicates that village size class, distance from the village and proximity to other villages were significant predictors of the disturbance index. The index distinguished each village’s spatially explicit ecological impact. We estimated that an average area of 23.7\\xa0km2 of the forest surrounding the six focal villages was altered by human activities. These six villages have directly impacted 8–10% of this protected area.'], ['Kodagu is one of the green districts in the Western Ghats, which contributes to a major share of coffee production in India with a rich cultural heritage, a significant part of which is a sustainable outlook in all aspects of life.

In this study, we evaluated the ability of the world's PAs to represent extant amphibian species. We also estimated the magnitude of the human footprint along the geographic distributions of gap species (i.e., those with distributions totally outside PAs). Twenty-four percent of species (n\\xa0=\\xa01535) are totally unrepresented, and another 18% (n\\xa0=\\xa01119) have less than 5% of their distribution inside PAs. Nearly half of all species with ranges under 1000\\xa0km2 do not occur inside any PA. Furthermore, more than 65% of the distribution of gap species is in human-dominated landscapes. Although the Earth's PAs have greatly increased during the last ten years, the number of unprotected amphibians has also grown. Tropical countries in particular should strongly consider (1) the importance of using amphibians to drive conservation policies that eventually lead to the implementation and management of PAs, given amphibians' extinction risk and ability to act as bioindicators; (2) the effectiveness of national recovery plans for threatened amphibian species; and (3) the need for increased funding for scientific research to expand our knowledge of amphibian species. Meanwhile, data-deficient amphibian species should receive a higher priority than they usually receive in conservation planning, as a precautionary measure. Throughout this paper, we point out several challenges in creating more comprehensive amphibian conservation strategies and opportunities in the next decade.\"], ['Ethnopharmacological relevanceTraditional medicine remained as the most affordable and easily accessible source of treatment for many ailments.

Hence, this study was initiated with an aim to record the ethnomedicinal plants of Malayali tribes and to document and analyse the local knowledge on phytotherapy before environmental and cultural changes deplete the resources.MethodsIn order to document the phytotherapical knowledge, a field study was carried out between August 2012 and February 2014. The ethnomedicinal knowledge was recorded through interviews among the Malayali tribes, and traditional healers. In addition a semi structure questionnaire was used to collect information on the local name of the plant, plant part used for curing, method of preparation in phytoremedies and any other plants/agents used as ingredients. Factor of informant consensus (Fic), use value (UV), fidelity level (FL), relative importance (RI) and novelty index were employed in data analysis.ResultsCurrent research work reports total of 86 medicinal plant species belonging to 76 genera of 46 different families. Herbs constituted the largest growth habit (48 species, 56%) followed by trees (13 species, 15%) and shrubs (9 species, 11%) etc. Leaf 43 (46%) is the plant part widely used followed by whole plant 9 (10%), seeds and fruits 9 (10%) and root 7 (8%). Paste was the most common preparation method use in herbal recipes. These plants were used to treat various human diseases and ailments grouped under 19 disease categories with the highest number of species (31) being used for dermatological infections/diseases followed by gastro-intestinal ailments (28) and general health (15). Asystasia chelonoides (UV of 2.76) and Piper nigrum (UV of 2.12) are the most frequently and popularly used medicinal plant species in the study area.ConclusionThe result of the study revealed that there was high diversity of medicinal plants and traditional knowledge about the use, preparation, and application of which is still maintained in the study area. However, the knowledge of herbal medicine was held by elders.

Thirteen accessions of Rauvolfia collected from different locations in the Western Ghat region of the peninsular India were analyzed for genetic variation using 15 ISSR primers. The 91 polymorphic amplicons generated were statistically analyzed using WinDist and PopGene software to calculate various diversity indices. Contrary to the general concept of low genetic variation associated with inbreeders, R. serpentina exhibits high genetic diversity as the similarity index value based on Nei and Li’s similarity coefficient ranges from 0.44 to 0.92 with mean value of 0.70. This is supported by other diversity parameters like Degree of genetic differentiation (Gst), Gene flow (Nm), Nei’s gene diversity (h) and Shannon index of genetic diversity (I). Cluster analysis showed characteristic grouping which is not in accordance with their geographical affiliation. The result indicates that ISSR markers are sufficiently informative in assessing genetic diversity across wild accessions of R. serpentina. The high genetic diversity observed in this otherwise self-pollinated plant entails the need for evolving effective ex-situ strategy for long-term conservation of this medicinal herb.'], ['Up-scaling the evaluation of threat status of biodiversity from species to ecosystem level has remained for long a research challenge in global conservation science. To meet this challenge, the present study makes an attempt toward actionable conservation prescription and assigning a threat category scheme for forest ecosystems. The scheme sets the quantitative criteria for evaluation of cumulative anthropogenic threats in grid cells, such as deforestation, degradation, fragmentation, forest fires and biological invasions. Adopting the convention of IUCN, five conservation status categories (i.e. Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable, Near Threatened, Least Concern) have been similarly adopted for the forest ecosystems facing these threats. The operational success of this scheme of threat categories at ecosystem level has been strengthened by remote sensing and field data generated for the forest ecosystems of Odisha, India. The threat category status of the forest ecosystems were identified by creating grids (5\\xa0km\\xa0×\\xa05\\xa0km) in GIS and assigned the degree of the threats for each grid. The database on deforestation was generated using topographical maps of 1935 and remote sensing data of 1975 and 2010. The degradation in forest ecosystems have been assessed based on the change in forest canopy closure, fragmentation pattern, forest fire distribution and impact of biological invasions. The analysis for conservation priority hotspots complements an assessment of the threatened ecosystems undergoing remarkable level of multiple threats. Areas under the danger of cumulative anthropogenic threats would have a higher priority. 5.8% grids of existing forest had included under the category of conservation priority hotspot-I, followed by 12.4% in conservation priority hotspot-II, and 12.5% in conservation priority hotspot-III. An integrated approach involving the cumulative anthropogenic threat indicators have been found to be the most appropriate tool to empirically evaluate the threat status of the forest ecosystems. Finally, identification of ecosystems especially those facing increasing extinction risks, as attempted in the present study, can help in devising an appropriate policy and management agenda for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.'], ['Within the framework of a programme on the functioning of dense moist evergreen forests of the Western Ghats, the French Institute of Pondicherry, in collaboration with the Karnataka Forest Department, installed permanent plots to monitor the dynamics of a low elevation forest. The preliminary results of the comparison of the demographic processes in two compartments are presented: one compartment had never been harvested, while the other was selectively felled in 1979–1980. They are compared in terms of species composition, recruitment, mortality and individual growth, in order to describe the natural forest dynamics and evaluate the impact of selective felling. In both compartments, the mortality rate, around 0.9% yr−1, is lower than in other tropical moist evergreen forests, while the average diameter increment, at 2.1 (unlogged stand) and 2.9 mm yr−1 (logged stand), is higher. The impact of selective felling, 10 to 15 years after the harvest, is mainly noticeable: (i) on mortality of trees with dbh>40 cm belonging to lower canopy and intermediate stratum species which died about four times more in the logged compartment; and (ii) on diameter increment of emergent and upper canopy tree species whose growth is still stimulated by about 50%. Despite the general trend of a reduction in the difference between the density and the basal area of the two compartments, medium-term modification of the demographic processes among the various structural ensembles in the logged compartment, indicates that selective felling may not be sustainable in the long-term without consequences on the forest structure and composition.'], ['Most of the world’s remaining terrestrial biodiversity exists in tropical ecosystems affected by human activities. Despite the threats to seasonally dry tropical ecosystems, little is known about the impact of human land use change on their conservation value. We used savanna woodlands within the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot as a case study to understand the effects of human land use on plant diversity. We investigated the effects of three common land-use activities – biomass extraction, livestock grazing and ground fire – on species richness and diversity, as well as species composition in terms of the breadth of geographic ranges of species present. We found that total species richness increased with livestock grazing due to increased understory richness. Overstory diversity and tree sapling diversity and richness decreased with more recent fire. Greater canopy openness was associated with increased understory richness and reduced overstory richness. The combination of fire and livestock grazing are likely to increase canopy openness, leading to a shift in diversity from the overstory to the understory. Although we found no change in species richness or diversity with biomass extraction, areas with biomass extraction had more widely distributed species and fewer narrowly distributed species, indicating land use may lead to biotic homogenization. Our results suggest that a mosaic of protected areas along with areas managed for biomass extraction and livestock grazing would be an effective way to balance the conservation of plant diversity with local communities’ needs while maintaining overall levels of plant species diversity in these savanna woodlands.'], ['To conserve a large, wide-ranging carnivore like the tiger, it is critical not only to maintain populations at key habitat sites, but also to enable the persistence of the species across much larger landscapes. To do this, it is important to establish well-linked habitat networks where sites for survival and reproduction of tigers are complemented by opportunities for dispersal and colonization. On the ground, expanding protection to areas with a potential for tiger recovery still remains the means of operationalizing the landscape approach. Yet, while the gazetting of protected areas is necessary to enable this, it is not sufficient. It is essential to benchmark and monitor the process by which establishment of protected areas must necessarily be followed by management changes that enable a recovery of tigers, their prey and their habitats. In this paper, we report a case study from the Cauvery and Malai Mahadeshwara Hills Wildlife Sanctuaries of southern India, where we document the infrastructural and institutional changes that ensued after an unprecedented expansion of protected areas in this landscape. Further, we establish ecological benchmarks of the abundance and distribution of tigers, the relative abundance of their prey, and the status of their habitats, against which the recovery of tigers in this area of vast conservation potential may be assessed over time.'], ['Connectivity for large mammals across human-altered landscapes results from movement by individuals that can be described via nested spatial scales as linkages (or zones or areas) with compatible land use types, constrictions that repeatedly funnel movement (as corridors) or impede it (as barriers), and the specific paths (or routes) across completely anthropogenic features (such as highways). Mitigation to facilitate animal movement through such landscapes requires similar attention to spatial scale, particularly when they involve complex topography, diverse types of human land use, and transportation infrastructure. We modeled connectivity for Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and gaur (Bos gaurus) in the Shencottah Gap, a multiple-use region separating two tiger reserves in the Western Ghats, India. Using 840\\xa0km of surveys for animal signs within a region of 621\\xa0km2, we modeled landscape linkages via resource selection functions integrated across two spatial resolutions, and then potential dispersal corridors within these linkages using circuit theoretical models. Within these corridors, we further identified potential small-scale movement paths across a busy transportation route via least-cost paths and evaluated their viability. Both elephants and gaur avoided human-dominated habitat, resulting in broken connectivity across the Shencottah Gap. Predicted corridor locations were sensitive to analysis resolution, and corridors derived from scale-integrated habitat models correlated best with habitat quality. Less than 1% of elephant and gaur detections occurred in habitat that was poorer in quality than the lowest-quality component of the movement path across the transportation route, suggesting that connectivity will require habitat improvement. Only 28% of dispersal corridor area and 5% of movement path length overlapped with the upper 50% quantile of the landscape linkage; thus, jointly modeling these three components enabled a more nuanced evaluation of connectivity than any of them in isolation.'], ['Available secondary suspended sediment data from the 1980s was analyzed together with new data collected during 2001–2003 at instrumented sites upstream and downstream of open-cast mining activities (∼4.2\\xa0km2) in an enclosure within the Kudremukh National Park in south India. More than 50% of the suspended sediment load in both the Bhadra River and Bhadra Reservoir comes from mining-affected lands that occupy <1% of the total catchment area (1968\\xa0km2). For baseflow conditions during the post-monsoon period of 2001, 0.02\\xa0Mg\\xa0km−2\\xa0day−1 of suspended sediment was discharged at the upstream site compared with 0.74\\xa0Mg\\xa0km−2\\xa0day−1 downstream of the mine. During the 2002 and 2003 monsoons, these rates increased to about 1.99 and 7.89\\xa0Mg\\xa0km−2\\xa0day−1 for upstream and downstream sites, respectively. The specific sediment yield above the mine is 239\\xa0Mg\\xa0km−2\\xa0year−1 versus 947\\xa0Mg\\xa0km−2\\xa0year−1 downstream. Sediment concentration downstream was significantly higher than upstream for all conditions. The current annual suspended sediment load below the mine ranges from 100,000 to over 150,000\\xa0Mg, depending on the size and frequency of large rain events. During the 2002 and 2003 monsoon seasons, 20–30% of the total suspended sediment load during the sampling period of 67 and 123 days, respectively, was transported in one single day and over one-third of the total recorded suspended load is discharged in less than 4 days in each monsoon. Daily rainfall and maximum hourly rainfall intensity were reasonable predictors of daily sediment loads downstream of the mine (R2\\xa0=\\xa00.71 and 0.575, respectively; p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). However, the upstream response was not predicted well by these variables, suggesting an absence of rapid overland pathways and/or reduced availability of easily transportable sediment on the less-disturbed lands above the mining area. Large episodic sediment events downstream of the mine were associated with daily rainfall >150\\xa0mm and hourly intensities exceeding 20\\xa0mm. One hundred and nine such episodic events occurred between 1990 and 2001 alone. A conservative estimate of the total suspended sediment load in the Bhadra River after mining commenced in the 1980s is 1.37\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0Mg, although the actual value could be considerably higher, up to 107\\xa0Mg. Comparison of historic data and another study in 1994, with recent measurements confirm that mining and associated activities in Kudremukh National Park are the greatest sources of sediment entering the Bhadra River; and the Bhadra river carries considerably more sediment now than before mining started damaging riverine ecosystems and disrupting downstream water resources.'], [\"We evaluated the conservation attitudes of the local villagers living adjacent to the Kalakad–Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in southern India 6 years after implementation of a World Bank funded eco-development project. We assessed attitudes towards three facets of conservation: the tiger, an emblematic species signifying India's commitment to wildlife conservation; the forest, a principle source of fuel-wood and other products; and the Forest Department, which manages the forest. More specifically we predicted that (i) attitudes would be an effective predictor of resource use interest in the forest and (ii) benefits obtained from the EDP would create more favorable attitudes towards conservation and the protected area employees. Twelve villages located within 3\\xa0km from the reserve boundary were chosen and 2–3% of the households interviewed with regard to their attitudes towards these three facets of conservation, their household resource use patterns, wealth, sex, age and length of residency. We found significant associations between wealth, sex, age and both tiger and forest conservation. Providing benefits has not changed the underlying attitudes of the communities. The poorer sections of society, whether receiving benefits or not, tended to support tiger conservation because conserving wildlife did not affect their livelihood in any way, whereas both the rich and poor had misgivings about forest conservation due to dependency on forest products. We conclude that the eco-development project has not effectively addressed the most important of the local concerns.\"], ['Aboveground biomass of individual tree species by component and total biomass per unit area for four different stages of a recovering tropical dry deciduous forest stands, dominated by sal (Shorea robusta Gaertn. f.) of the Eastern Ghats, India were investigated during 2001–2002. Different periods of recovering (2, 4, 6, and 10-year) forest stands (84°13′E, 20°29′N) were selected in the Kandhamal district of Orissa, India and sample trees of all species were harvested. Tree species diversity was 23, 23, 21 and 22 in 2, 4, 6, and 10-year recovering stands, respectively. Species-wise Ixora pavetta showed the highest biomass in 2 and 4-year stands while Shorea robusta in 6 and 10-year stands. Component-wise, in all species, bole–wood contribution ranged between 22.6% and 60.9%. Aboveground tree biomass, in all the stands, was dominated by Shorea robusta, which ranged between 12.68 and 231.91\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1.

The plant is restricted to only two pockets of Assam with a poor population size. Therefore, conservation of this plant through proper scientific investigation is urgently needed. The present study has as its objectives to study the distribution, standardization of suitable macropropagation methods for reinforcement and reintroduction in suitable wild habitat, as determined by ecological niche modelling (ENM) for the purposes of conservation. For improving the conservation status of the species, potential area and habitat for reintroduction was determined using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) distribution modelling algorithm. Seed germination under natural conditions was found to be very poor for which a macropropagation protocol was standardized; plantlets were raised and reinforced to locations where the population size is very small i.e., mean density, frequency of occurrence and abundance in relation to other associated species was 17.77, 14.16 and 0.82 respectively. Macropropagation method standardized here through cutting was found to be more efficient in terms of time and cost. Application of 100\\xa0ppm indole −3- butyric acid (IBA) and 40\\xa0ppm naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) significantly improved rooting traits. Further, survival rate was measured significantly very high at 73% while 1000 numbers of V. borneensis plantlets were transferred to the field.

The literature contains dramatically different estimates of these incentives, from trivial to quite large. We resolve this controversy by isolating the fundamental source of the discrepancy and then providing empirically defensible estimates based on that analysis. Results demonstrate that the bioprospecting incentive is unlikely to generate much private-sector conservation. Thus, other mechanisms are likely required to preserve the public good of biodiversity.'], ['Sedimentationreduces the capacity of the reservoir and it is the important concern for watershed management. This paper presentsthe computation of sediment yield of Agrani River basin of Sangli and Belgavi districts in Maharashtra and Karnataka, India using RS and GIS techniques. The land use/land cover (LULC) map of the study area was prepared by supervised classification using satellite imagery of IRS P6 LISS III and ERDAS-imagine v9.1 image processing software. 26.67% of the area is occupied by agricultural land, 20.37% area covers forest land, 27.06% area of fallow land. Meteorological parameters such as average annual rainfall and mean annual temperature are then used to calculate amount of sediment yield in the reservoir. Garde model was used for determination of annual sediment yield. Mean annual runoff and sediment yield for investigating area is19.30 million m3 and 0.0897 million m3/year, respectively. With very fine drainage texture, drainage density in the study area is1.88 km/km2.'], ['Spatially explicit planning is required to set focused conservation priorities and assessing future ecological implications. Spatial ecological modeling and hotspot analysis prioritizes the forest ecosystems and supports the conservation of species level biodiversity. In the present study, the hotspots of deforestation and forest fires were obtained using historical deforestation trends (1975–1985–1995–2005–2014) and fire history (2009–2014) in Andhra Pradesh, India. The priority areas were identified as deforestation and degradation hotspots using combined measures of threat from deforestation, fire hotspots and current level of forest fragmentation. The state of Andhra Pradesh represents an area of 25985\\xa0km2 (16.2% of total geographical area) under forest cover in 2014. The net deforested area was estimated as 2390\\xa0km2 (8.4%) from 1975 to 2014. We have calculated the region of influence in percentages and found deforestation hotspots covering an average of 40.2% forest, followed by 35.9% under high fragmentation and 19.2% under fire hotspots. Ecosystem level analysis has been carried out for all the forest types i.e., semi evergreen, moist deciduous, dry deciduous, dry evergreen, thorn and mangroves, indicating ecosystem vulnerability. According to the results of prioritization, about 10.5% of existing forest had severe ecosystem collapse and categorized as deforestation and degradation hotspot-I. Analysis of protected areas shows Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve, Sri Peninsula Narasimha sanctuary, Papikonda sanctuary and Sri Venkateshwara sanctuary are representing deforestation and degradation hotspot-I. Deforestation and degradation hotspots identified in the study is an excellent surrogate for understanding anthropogenic disturbances and can be effectively useful in forest management to proceed for applicable restoration measures.'], ['IntroductionMedicinal plants have been used to treat various ailments since ancient times, as a result ethnobotanical investigations have a major role in pharmacological studies. The present study was conducted among the ethnic population known as the ‘Adiyans’, located in one of the little explored rich biodiversity areas in the Western Ghats. The aim was to collect and document information on the indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants.MethodsThe field survey was carried out during August 2015 to July 2016 among the Adiyan people in Chandanatodu, Thavihal and Thirunelly villages of the Wayanad district located in Kerala, India. Ethnomedicinal information was obtained through interviews/discussions and the collected data were analyzed using the informant consensus factor (Fic).ResultsFolk medicines practiced by indigenous people in the study area are used for their primary healthcare needs. The data gathered exemplified the knowledge of people using folk medicinal practices. Most of the documented claims used by Adiyans in the present study have not been shown in previous research in the nearby regions of Kerala, India and across the globe.ConclusionFinding further evidence for medicinal claims used by the indigenous community in this study highlights the need for scientific research to support documented folk use. Of the documented ethnomedicinal plants, Caesalpinia mimosoides, Desmodium triflorum, Elaeocarpus tuberculatus, E. serratus, Hydnocarpus macrocarpa, Pterospermum reticulatum, P. rubiginosum and Zizyphus nummularia have been poorly studied in vitro and in vivo models. It is important to validate their usage in terms of pharmacological activity.'], [\"This paper takes its inspiration from Karl W. Butzer's course on the Human Use of Landforms at the University of Chicago. It builds upon that concept through an exploration of regional settlement patterns and landforms in the Deccan volcanic province of west-central India. The first section develops a conceptual framework for analyzing human adjustment to landforms on regional, settlement, and site scales. The second section employs that framework to analyze four major landform-settlement configurations in the Deccan from antiquity to the end of the eighteenth century. The Satavahana kingdom (ca. 100\\u202fBCE to 200\\u202fCE) had a strong southeast to northwest alignment along the Godavari River. Their capital city of Paithan was located at a navigable sacred ford across the river (tirtha), which was linked with upstream confluences (sangams), tanks (kunds), mountain passes (ghats), and port cities on the Arabian Sea. Subsequent Hindu dynasties (ca. 850–1300\\u202fCE) shifted from fluvial landforms to a north-south alignment along steep mesa escarpments and buttes in the central Deccan that provided defensive fortress and cave temple sites. Sultanate and Mughal forces expanded the urban footprint on nearby plateau lands at sites protected by surrounding mesas (ca. 1330–1700\\u202fCE). These cities were supported by local watershed runoff and long distance water channels. The final precolonial phase of Deccan settlement entailed a shift from the semiarid central plateaus to humid headwaters of the Western Ghats, whose buttes and scarps provided sites for scores of forts controlled by the founder of the Maratha empire Chhatrapati Shivaji in the seventeenth century. Maratha success led to development downstream at the capital city of Pune (1627–1803\\u202fCE), located at a river confluence flanked by mesas, which combined the strategies of previous periods. Over two millennia these four distinct, yet intersecting, patterns of human-landform relations have shaped an evolving geocultural region on the Deccan plateau that deserves comparison with other flood basalt regions.\"], [\"This study documents a holistic approach, combining mineralogical, geochemical and textural data to characterize the decorative earthen plaster of the 2nd century BCE. Buddhist rock cut caves of Karle in Western India. The analytical examination was carried out by the use of a petrological microscope, Laser particle size analysis, thin section analysis, XRF (X Ray fluorescence), XRD (X Ray Diffraction), FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) and Raman spectroscopy in addition to the monitoring of environmental parameters. The results indicate that the local clayey soil, which is abundantly available in the high rain fed western coastal areas, was utilized for the earliest earthen plaster works. The characteristics of the clay seem to have been modified by mixing calcite and an organic adhesive. Rounded sub-angular aggregates derived from disintegration of basaltic rock and rice husk were added to influence shrinkage properties of the plaster. In addition to a better understanding of the technology and composition of ancient India's early earthen plasterworks, scientific data from the analysis was used to plan the composition of restoration plaster.\"], ['Urban botanical gardens conserve historical flora, improve the local environment and promote human well-being. Unfortunately they are often undervalued due to lack of public awareness or resources. Analysis of species diversity and turnover at long-lived gardens can improve the understanding of long-term plant resilience and help adapt management actions to align with rapidly changing urban contexts. Given the various threats faced by urban botanical gardens, we examined tree species diversity, historical changes and survival of plants at the Botanical Garden in Pondicherry (BGP), southern India, which was established 192 years ago by the colonial French government.A complete census of trees was carried out to compare current species diversity with two historical lists compiled 151 years ago and 57 years ago, respectively. These lists were also used to identify heritage trees. Effects of environmental threats, including the very severe cyclonic storm Thane (December 2011) and various damages to young stems, were analysed with Google Earth images and field inventories.There were 284 identified tree species, including 25 endangered/vulnerable/threatened species and 53 tropical dry evergreen forest species. Turnover had occurred, and approximately half of the historical species had been replaced with new species. Tropical Cyclone Thane caused severe damage to large trees and anthropogenic activities damaged saplings. Yet, at least 65 large resilient individuals had survived all the threats, and signifiy the adaptability and heritage value of the BGP.Our study revealed multiple values of this heritage green space in a rapidly developing South Asian city and suggests strategies for modernisation that are aligned with international conservation guidelines. We recommend better monitoring and utilisation of cyclone-damage data to guide future plant introductions at this coastal site.'], ['Conservation of existing remnants of tropical forests outside protected areas remains a major challenge because of developmental pressures. It is likely that, as forests outside of protected areas disappear, the pressure on protected areas will grow. Thus, it is important to conserve biodiversity outside protected areas, at least as buffers for protected areas, a conservation practice enshrined in the Aichi Biodiversity Targets for the 2011–2020 period. We designed a contingent valuation study to value the restoration of native trees on coffee plantations in the Kodagu district of Karnataka in India. Our study includes a sample of 1029 respondents who visited these sites. The survey was conducted using a pretested questionnaire to collect data from tourists between January and June 2016. We found that visitors derive positive benefits from the restoration of native tree species that form a dense tree-like ecosystem providing refuge for biodiversity not only on coffee plantations but also in adjoining protected areas. Visitors were willing to pay an average 187 Indian Rupees (INR) for the restoration program. The total estimated value for the restoration of native tree species is INR 47 million per annum. Thus, there is scope to collect and mobilize tourist revenue for the restoration program. We propose, in concurrence with local stakeholders, an institutional mechanism to generate and transfer the increased revenue from the surcharge to the coffee-growers to implement the proposed program.'], ['Understanding the impact of climate change on species invasion is crucial for sustainable biodiversity conservation. Through this study, we try to answer how species differing in phenological cycles, specifically Cassia tora and Lantana camara, differ in the manner in which they invade new regions in India in the future climate. Since both species occupy identical niches, exploring their invasive potential in different climate change scenarios will offer critical insights into invasion and inform ecosystem management. We use three modelling protocols (i.e., maximum entropy, generalised linear model and generalised additive model) to predict the current distribution. Projections are made for both moderate (A1B) and extreme (A2) IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) scenarios for the year 2050 and 2100. The study reveals that the distributions of C.\\xa0tora (annual) and L.\\xa0camara (perennial) would depend on the precipitation of the warmest quarter and moisture availability. C.\\xa0tora may demonstrate physiological tolerance to the mean diurnal temperature range and L.\\xa0camara to the solar radiation. C.\\xa0tora may invade central India, while L.\\xa0camara may invade the Western Himalaya, parts of the Eastern Himalaya and the Western Ghats. The distribution ranges of both species could shift in the northern and north-eastern directions in India, owing to changes in moisture availability. The possible alterations in precipitation regimes could lead to water stress, which might have cascading effects on species invasion. L.\\xa0camara might adapt to climate change better compared with C.\\xa0tora. This comparative analysis of the future distributions of two invasive plants with contrasting habits demonstrates that temporal complementarity would prevail over the competition.'], ['The Indus River dolphin (Platanista gangetica minor) is a freshwater cetacean that occurs only in the Indus River system in Pakistan and India. This review provides a comprehensive summary of issues surrounding Indus dolphin conservation, and includes a description of their distribution, the threats they face and a discussion of conservation and research activities, options and priorities. Information was gathered from published current and historical literature, newspaper articles, and unpublished reports. Prior to construction of the Indus Irrigation system dolphins occurred in 3500\\xa0km of the Indus River system. Their range has now declined by 80% due to fragmentation of river habitat by barrages and large-scale diversion of water for irrigated agriculture. The subspecies was estimated to number approximately 1450 individuals in 2011, and occurs in 6 subpopulations, three of which are probably too small to persist. There is an urgent need to evaluate whether dolphins move through barrages, as this has the potential to extirpate upstream subpopulations. Pre-requisites for dolphin translocations to combat this problem are outlined. Mortality in fishing gear and high levels of chemical pollution in water courses are both increasing threats exacerbated by depleted flows. Research and conservation priorities include maintenance of river flows, mortality monitoring, canal rescues and community-based conservation. Conservation and research action is urgently needed to prevent the Indus dolphin from succumbing to the same fate as the baiji.'], ['Chilika lake is the biggest lagoon in the Indian Eastern coast and is a source of livelihood for peoples of the coastal region surrounding it mainly through fisheries. However, the deposition of sediments in the lake carried through runoff water from its drainage basins may alter this wetland ecosystem in future. Implementation of appropriate soil water conservation measures may reduce the sediment load in runoff water and thus may protect this lagoon ecosystem. Keeping in view these concerns, runoff water from a selected watershed of western catchment of Chilika lagoon was modeled through ArcSWAT with a purpose to estimate future runoff potential from western catchment. Effective hydraulic conductivity of main channel, base flow alpha factor, curve number corresponding to antecedent moisture content II, and roughness coefficient of main channel were found most sensitive parameters in decreasing order. Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient of predicted monthly runoff was 0.72 and 0.88 during calibration and validation period, respectively whereas root mean squared error of predicted monthly runoff was 54.5 and 66.1\\xa0mm, respectively. Modeling results indicated that about 60% of rainfall is partitioned to runoff water, which carry significant amount of sediment load and contributes to Chilika lake.'], ['An ethnobotanical survey was carried out among the ethnic groups (Kani/Kanikaran) in Southern Western Ghats of India. Traditional uses of 54 plant species belonging to 26 families are described under this study. In this communication, the information got from the tribals were compared with the already existing literature on ethnobotany of India.

The medicinal plants used by kanis are arranged alphabetically followed by family name, local name, major chemical constituents, parts used, mode of preparation and medicinal uses.'], ['This paper examines the growth of interrelated tourism phenomena yoga tourism and spiritual tourism - both sit under the wider umbrella of wellness tourism. Tourism has long been linked with spirituality and where this is the case (for example pilgrimage travel), it is considered to pave the way for personal transformation. Linking spiritual tourism to yoga tourism is a fait accompli, as is drawing similar associations with wellness and pilgrimage tourism on account of allied and abiding motivations predicated on uniting mind, body and spirit and these ruminations are central to this paper. More recently, there has been a growing chorus calling for the decolonisation of yoga on account of its commodification and industrialisation, and especially concerning what is argued to be a shift away from its spiritual and transformative tenets. The underlying meaning of the Sanskrit word yuj from which yoga is derived alludes to the pursuit of achieving a sense of union with something higher than oneself, and this is arguably one of the key drivers for its contemporary acceptance. Linkages between spirituality and yoga tourism through an examination of the motivations of Western yoga devotees in Maharashtra, India provide the canvas for this analysis. The motivations for yoga related travel and the broader implications for yoga and spiritual tourism are discussed. This article draws from two periods of exploratory fieldwork conducted in 2014 and 2015 in Maharashtra, India. A qualitative, case study scaffold underpinned by serious leisure as a conceptual framework (Stebbins, 2001) was constructed.'], ['The conservation challenges facing mega-biodiverse South and Southeast Asia in the 21st century are enormous. For millennia, much of the habitat of these regions was only lightly modified by human endeavour, yet now it is experiencing rampant deforestation, logging, biofuel cropping, invasive species expansion, and the synergies of climate change, drought, fire and sea-level rise. Although small-scale conservation management might assist some species and habitats, the broader sweep of problems requires big thinking and some radical solutions. Given the long expected lead times between progressive economic development and stabilization of human population size and consumption rates, we argue that ‘technological fixes’ cannot be ignored if we are to address social and fiscal drivers of environmental degradation and associated species extinctions in rapidly developing regions like southern Asia. The pursuit of cheap and abundant ‘clean’ energy from an economically rational mix of nuclear power, geothermal, solar, wind, and hydrogen-derivative ‘synfuels’, is fundamental to this goal. This will permit pathways of high-tech economic development that include intensified (high energy-input) agriculture over small land areas, full recycling of material goods, a transition from fossil-fuel use for transport and electricity generation, a rejection of tropical biofuels that require vast areas of arable land for production, and a viable alternative to the damming of major waterways like the Mekong, Murum and northern tributaries of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers for hydroelectricity. Rational approaches that work at large scales must be used to deal with the ultimate, rather than just proximate, drivers of biodiversity loss in the rapidly developing regions of southern Asia.'], ['The fate of much of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity is linked to the management of human-modified forest landscapes in the humid tropics. This Special Issue presents the first pan-tropical synthesis of research on the prospects for biodiversity in such systems, with eight individual regional summaries covering Mesoamerica, Amazonia, Atlantic forest of South America, West Africa, Madagascar, Western Ghats, Southeast Asia and Oceania. Two additional papers compare the state of conservation science in tropical forests with both temperate forests and savannah systems. This overview paper provides a comparative analysis of the threats and opportunities facing tropical forest biodiversity, thereby helping to identify the most pressing areas of future research and region-specific factors that contribute towards the effectiveness of individual conservation initiatives. While many of the threats facing tropical forest biodiversity are commonplace they vary markedly in their relative importance across different regions. There is a critical lack of comparable data to understand scale dependent processes, or the relative importance of varying geographic and historical contexts in determining present-day patterns. Conservation science has a key role to play in safeguarding the future of tropical forest biodiversity, but needs to become more effectively embedded in the context of real-world conservation challenges and opportunities. Significant progress can be achieved by improving the cost-effectiveness of research as well as the exchange of ideas and data amongst scientists working in different, often isolated parts of the world. We hope this special issue goes some way top achieving this exchange of knowledge.'], ['There is growing recognition that the fate of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity depends on the management of human-dominated tropical forest landscapes. While global environmental change is transforming the ecology of tropical forests, a number of studies have also demonstrated that tropical forests are able to recover following disturbance. But are tropical forests resilient to environmental and anthropogenic disturbances over timescales of centuries or millennia? Here we examine the relationship between vegetation cover and variation in monsoon rainfall, soil erosion, and fire over 7500\\xa0years in an ancient tropical landscape in the Western Ghats of India. We collected two overlapping sediment sequences at one study site and analysed them with palaeoecological techniques to reconstruct vegetation cover. Results suggest that climate and land-use changes might have had synergistic effects on this forested landscape, although the relationship between these factors and vegetation cover has varied over time. Results also indicate that the weakening of monsoon around 5750 BP might have caused a threshold event altering this landscape to a low tree-cover state. Although anthropogenic fire has maintained this landscape in low tree cover state from 3500 BP, this degraded tree–grassland mosaic has remained relatively resilient to fluctuations in environmental and anthropogenic factors. Tree taxa present throughout the sequence have lighter seeds than those absent in parts of the sequence, suggesting that dispersal mode might be an important factor in their persistence. Despite maintaining a degraded and fragmented forest mosaic, however, this landscape has supported populations of heavy-seeded trees and a probable refuge to their dispersal agents. We suggest that retaining tree cover on this landscape, even if fragmented, is key to maintaining its ecological resilience to environmental and anthropogenic disturbance.'], ['In India, conservation of biodiversity goes hand in hand with human welfare, as millions of people live adjacent or within protected areas and depend upon forests products. The high density and biomass requirements of these households could result in the degradation of forests and loss of biodiversity. We assessed the collection of forest products among households in five sites in the Western and Eastern Ghats of peninsular India: the Kogar region of the Central Western Ghats, the Bandipur and Sigur regions of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the Kalakad–Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve of the southern Western Ghats and Similipal Tiger Reserve of the northern Eastern Ghats, and tested whether extraction pressure on forests was associated with the proportion of agricultural households, wage labour and population density. We also examined whether data on loss of cover as stated by the State of the Forest Reports was supported by field data. The regions differed in land use: Kogar, KMTR and Similipal were primarily agricultural regions, whereas households engaged in wage labour or in running small businesses were predominant in Sigur and Bandipur. Fuel–wood was collected ubiquitously for household use in all sites, used mainly for domestic requirements and secondarily for generating income. Green leaves for making fertilizer and fodder were collected for household use and did not enter the market. Cattle manure for the global organic coffee industry was a major forest product in Bandipur and Sigur. Extraction pressure on forests was positively associated with the availability of wage labour and was negatively with the proportion of agricultural households. Data from official sources seem inadequate to measure forest degradation in protected forests. Accurate estimation of forest condition through field assessments and remote sensing, and understanding the socio-economic variables associated with forest loss and degradation are needed for the sustainable management of Indian protected areas.'], ['The population dynamics of the ground vegetation and its energetics such as biomass accumulation and net primary productivity, and the nutrient cycling patterns in the humid tropical forest of the Western Ghats in India are largely determined by gap age and by whether gaps are formed naturally or through selection felling. Responses of plant categories such as herbs, shrubs, tree seedlings and saplings also vary depending upon gap type and age. An exotic species such as Chromolaena odorata occurred only in selection-felled gaps ((9 ± 3)−(49 ± 4) individuals (100 m)−2). Nilgirianthus ciliatus, a dominant shrub, plays a key role in the gaps in determining population dynamics of others. The net primary productivity of the ground vegetation, which is about 31.17 ± 4.26 kg (100 m)−2 year−1 in an undisturbed site, increased a year after gap formation to 102.82 ± 6.46 kg (100 m)−2 year−1 in natural gaps and to 71.82 ± 2.36 kg (100 m)−2 year−1 in selection-felled gaps. Five years after gap formation, net primary productivity of the ground vegetation declined considerably, this being related to decline in fast-growing shrub and secondary tree species in the vegetation and gap closure. A similar trend was also recorded for the rates of nutrient uptake and nutrient accumulation in the vegetation.In natural gaps the soil nutrient level increased gradually with gap age. This could be attributed to slow release of nutrients from the fallen trunks and nutrient storage in the rapidly recovering vegetation. In contrast, in selection-felled gaps, the quantities of soil nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and magnesium were higher in 1-year-old gaps than in undisturbed sites, owing to the release of these nutrients from leaf litter and wood debris which were deposited in larger quantities within the gap itself, and owing to sparse ground vegetation resulting from the greater disturbance of the soil, in the first 1 or 2 years. The fractional annual turnover rates of elements of the ground vegetation and the soil were higher in 1-year-old gaps and declined with gap age. The significance of these results for forest management is discussed.'], ['The sustainable indigenous agro-ecosystems of India, a majority of which are degraded or destroyed, need protection. The main objective of this study was to analyse the traditional agro-ecosystems from structural and functional point of view and their interactions with other biophysical and socio-economic characters with a view to offer possible solutions. Analysis of traditional agro-ecosystems of three tribal villages, inhabited by Kondhs of Eastern Ghats of Orissa, India, revealed that cultivated land occupied 66% of the total land area. This covered valley, shifting and home garden cultivation. Under valley, rice (Oryza sativa L.) showed the maximum productivity (2–4\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1) among the crops. Minor millets and redgram (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) were cultivated under shifting cultivation in one of the villages. Vegetables and spices were the main crop under home garden. In valley agriculture human and draught power were the major inputs of energy, while in shifting cultivation human labour was the only source. Out of the total agricultural yield, 52.5, 90.6 and 75.9% were consumed in the villages of Rajikakhola, Nediguda and Badruguda, respectively. When agriculture, forest and animal husbandry sectors were taken together the average share of agricultural sector to the total consumption in the villages was 68.4%, the rest being contributed by forest, while the contribution of animal husbandry was almost negligible. Agricultural production can be stabilized through available rain water management, application of organic manure to agricultural fields and protection of the existing forests. Abandoned Podu (i.e. shifting cultivation) fields can be improved through agro-forestry practices.'], [' structure is known to vary across different scales of geographical separation, from differences between neighbours in a habitat to populations across continents. The high-elevation regions of the Western Ghats mountains in southern India form ‘sky islands’ containing the unique Shola habitat. Bird species on such sky islands are often specifically adapted to habitats typical of these islands while populations on different islands may have been geographically isolated over varying periods of time. Forest fragmentation can intensify the effects of such isolation by affecting species dispersal processes. We examined the effects of genetic differentiation across populations on the song of a threatened, endemic bird, the white-bellied shortwing, Brachypteryx major, on different islands of this sky island system. We compared songs from three populations, one of which on one island was genetically distinct from the other two populations on another island. These two populations were genetically similar but separated by recent deforestation. We recorded songs from 23 individuals and characterized 572 songs by 13 parameters. Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences in song between the three populations, with the genetically distinct populations across the two islands being the most differentiated. This was supported by a visual and aural examination of spectrograms that revealed characteristic qualitative differences in songs across these populations. Finally, this study corroborates accepted patterns of congruence between song and genetic divergence across islands and also highlights the difference in song between anthropogenically fragmented, but genetically similar populations, possibly owing to cultural drift.'], [\"A 98\\xa0cm core from Potapuram Cheruvu, a rain-fed tank in the Nallamalai Hills of south India, has been palynologically analyzed to study the changes in vegetation and climate of the recent past. This run-off harvesting reservoir, chosen on the basis of remote sensing analysis and field surveys, is not linked with any major river. Its water level is the lowest in the summer, for two to three months, during which time the sampling was carried out. The site, lying south of the “core monsoon zone”, gets most of its rains from the south-west monsoon. Palynological studies yielded 75 pollen taxa with “dryness”, “wetness”, and “human-impact” markers. The ecological attributes of the plant species assigned to the pollen taxa provide an indirect link to specific environments (wetter/drier) that supported the land cover. The analyzed core revealed the vegetation history around the site during the past two centuries through pollen analyses supported by remote sensing. Even during this short period, distinct fluctuations in the vegetation assemblages were observed. Remote sensing indicates that the forest cover did not change significantly during the past ∼30 years. During this period there was also a change in the area covered by scrub and agriculture. Taken together and linked to the variations of the individual forest tree markers, this leads to the following story: a definitely drier period between ca. AD 1798 and AD 1846 and a definitely wetter one between ca. AD 1876 and AD 1920. The results from the RS and GIS show that while there was almost no change in the forest cover of the Potapuram Cheruvu watershed between 1973 and 2005, taking into account the tank's seasonality by analyzing the wet and dry seasons, there was a notable decrease in the forest cover between 1924 and 1973.\"], ['Strict protected areas are a critical component in global biodiversity conservation, but the future of biodiversity conservation may well depend upon the ability to experiment successfully with a range of institutional forms, including those that permit human use. Here, we focus on forest commons in human-dominated landscapes and their role in biodiversity conservation at the same time as they provide livelihood benefits to users. Using a dataset of 59 forest commons located in Bhutan, India, and Nepal, we estimated tree species richness from plot vegetation data collected in each forest, and drew on interview data to calculate a livelihoods index indicating the overall contribution of each forest to villager livelihoods for firewood, fodder, and timber. We found that tree species richness and livelihoods were positively and significantly correlated (rho\\xa0=\\xa0.41, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001, N\\xa0=\\xa059). This relationship held regardless of forest type or country, though significance varied somewhat across these two factors. Further, both benefits were similarly associated with several drivers of social-ecological change (e.g., occupational diversity of forest users, total number of users, and forest size), suggesting identification of potential synergies and complexes of causal mechanisms for future attention. Our analysis shows that forest commons in South Asia, explicitly managed to provide livelihoods for local populations, also provide biodiversity benefits. More broadly, our findings suggest that although strict protected areas are effective tools for biodiversity conservation, a singular focus on them risks ignoring other resource governance approaches that can fruitfully complement existing conservation regimes.'], ['Ethnopharmacological relevanceIt is becoming increasingly clear that ethnopharmacology cannot be disassociated from food production, human nutrition and the conservation of the biodiversity that constitutes its resource base.Aim of the studyThis paper aims to provide a perspective of ethnopharmacology that explicitly extends the range of disciplines it covers so as to embrace food and nutrition and the biodiversity basis, both wild and agricultural, and also places it in the context of the dramatic changes to our planet that we are experiencing during a period of rapid global change and the impacts that these changes are having on human health and nutrition and on its resource base.Materials and methodsA review is made of recent initiatives and developments that show linkages between ethnopharmacology, agriculture, food production, nutrition and biodiversity conservation.ResultsEthnopharmacology, biodiversity, agriculture, food and nutrition are inextricably linked but suffer from compartmentalization and a lack of communication which have to be overcome if progress is to be made. Fortunately, a convergence of interest between the agricultural biodiversity and the biodiversity conservation sectors has emerged in recent years and there is an increased appreciation of the need to adopt a wider approach to human nutrition than the conventional agricultural model allows; there is also a greater awareness of the important role played by diversity of crops, especially local species, and consumption of wild species in achieving balanced nutrition. An increased recognition of the key role of local communities in managing agricultural biodiversity is evident. While ethnopharmacologists have expressed concern at the relentless loss of biodiversity, there has been little direct involvement but it is perhaps now time to consider a more proactive role. Attention is also drawn to the need to assess the implications of global change for ethnopharmacology.ConclusionsEthnopharmacologists need to take much more cognizance of the fate of the resource base – the plants, animals and microorganisms – and of the actions being undertaken under the auspices of treaties, such as the Conservation on Biological Diversity and its Global Strategy for Plant Conservation, and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, to counter its degradation and loss. In addition, they should play a more active role in determining the actions needed to assess, monitor and conserve the resource base. Although it has been suggested that the ‘golden days’ of ethnopharmacology may be over, it is proposed that by embracing the challenges of broadening the remit so as to include the health aspects of wild biodiversity employed in nutrition, a new ‘golden age’ beckons. The paper concludes with some suggestions for action.'], ['Effective monitoring of biodiversity for conservation requires information on spatial and temporal variation in species’ abundances. As conservation resources are limited, monitoring methods are required that enable rapid and cost effective data collection. There are many traditional methods of estimating absolute abundance, such as territory mapping and distance sampling. However, these typically require more time, expertise and finances than are available across much of the globe. This is especially so in the tropics, where high species richness, low densities of many species and structurally complex environments also make monitoring particularly challenging. The MacKinnon lists technique is a rapid assessment methodology designed for use in species rich environments. This method is typically used to estimate species richness, but it has also been suggested that it can generate consistent abundance indices, even when observer experience and environmental conditions vary. If this suggestion is correct, the MacKinnon lists method could be used to assess spatial or temporal changes in abundance using diverse survey data. Here, we provide the first detailed assessment of intra- and inter-observer consistency of the Mackinnon List method in generating species abundance indices that could be useful for conservation monitoring purposes. As a case study, we use one of the world’s most diverse avifaunas, that of the forested Bolivian Andes. We show that MacKinnon lists can provide species abundance indices that are consistent between observers of markedly different experience of the focal avifauna (zero to six years), and between assessments carried out in different stages of the breeding season, between which detectability of individuals differed significantly. We believe this is the first time that a biodiversity monitoring method has been demonstrated to produce consistent abundance indices for a highly diverse avian tropical assemblage. We also suggest that the MacKinnon lists methodology has the potential to be a very useful conservation monitoring tool for many taxa in species rich environments, such as the tropics.'], ['nderstanding of the role and potential of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) for livelihood improvement and conservation has been hindered by a lack of a clear theoretical framework and a functional typology of cases. To help fill this gap, we did a comparative analysis of 61 cases of commercial NTFP production in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Cases were documented using a standardized set of descriptors organized into categories describing various aspects of the production-to-consumption system. Exploratory analysis yielded useful case groupings by (a) household economic strategy and (b) NTFP production strategy. These groups and their key characteristics are used as a basis for discussing the development and conservation implications of NTFPs.'], ['Groundwater, a renewable and finite natural resource, is a vital source of sustenance for humans and different ecosystems in the semi-arid regions. Rapid population growth in the last three decades has caused a rise in water demand which has inadvertently posed a stress on its availability. Occurrence of groundwater in the Deccan Volcanic Province is governed by the subsurface hydrogeological heterogeneity of basaltic lava flows and by the presence of geological structures like dykes, sills and fractures that influence spatial & vertical groundwater flow. The main objective of this paper is to map and assess areas that are naturally most susceptible to groundwater scarcity and at risk of depletion due to over extraction. The current study involves a field hydrogeological mapping that was integrated with remote sensing and GIS to delineate areas. This technique was based on using different thematic layers viz. lithology, slope, land-use and land cover, lineament, drainage, soil type, depth to groundwater and annual rainfall. Additionally, pumping tests were carried out to classify the study area into different hydrogeological typologies to help delineate communities that are most vulnerable to subsurface heterogeneity. This paper attempts to underline the groundwater scarcity zones based on different influencing thematic layers and provide a robust methodology to prioritize areas vulnerable to groundwater unavailability, by categorizing the study area into different vulnerable class types – extreme, high, moderate and low.'], ['The genus Swertia (Gentianaceae) is one of the most potent and traded herbs in Asian countries that has been described in the Indian, British and American pharmacopoeias as tinctures and infusions, and has also been reported in Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha traditional systems of medicines. Several Swertia species are declared as critically endangered in line with its increasing demand in therapeutic industries, and as a consequence, a gap is continuously increasing between the commercial demand and supply of Swertia herb. The present study aims to assess the molecular and phytochemical diversity among 48 accessions of five Swertia species collected from Western Himalayas, India. Using 16 inter sequence simple repeats (ISSR) and 18 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, total 202 and 291 polymorphic bands were documented, respectively. Percentage of polymorphism ranged from 89% to 100%, and 75% to 95%, with an average of 94.8%, and 89.8%, respectively with the ISSR and RAPD primers. Overall, high level of intra-specific genetic diversity (Gst: 0.40; h: 0.20; I: 0.30) was observed among S. paniculata accessions whereas S. chirata accessions (Gst: 0.16; h: 0.08; I: 0.18) showed least genetic diversity. Moreover, among all the Swertia accessions, maximum yield of amarogentin (0.75\\u202f±\\u202f0.20%), and swertiamarin (6.68\\u202f±\\u202f0.10%) was found in the S. chirata collected from Chakrata-Deoban (Uttarakhand), followed by S. paniculata accessions collected from Triund-Trek Mountains (Himachal Pradesh) that displayed 0.66\\u202f±\\u202f0.10% amarogentin and 5.76\\u202f±\\u202f0.03% swertiamarin contents. Densitogram based on the complete linkage, Euclidean distance and similarity level also revealed highest phytochemical diversity among S. paniculata accessions. In the present study, both molecular and phytochemical markers visibly categorize different Swertia species and thus these approaches can be used as significant tools for the assessment of genetic diversity among genotypes of Swertia. In this study, the potent S. chirata displays a low degree of genetic diversity and gene flow, and therefore there is a major risk of extinction of this significant species. The results of the present study would be useful to identify the promising genotype and to develop conservation strategies for the elite Swertia species.'], ['Yet there is considerable uncertainty over management effectiveness of many protected areas around the world. In this regard, long-term monitoring and management of disturbances in the protected areas need to be properly addressed and documented. The present study is aimed to analyze spatial extent, frequency and distribution of forest fires in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, Western Ghats, India over four decades (1973–2014). Multi-temporal Landsat and Indian Remote Sensing satellite data were used to quantify forest burnt area. The results showed that the spatial extent of burnt area greatly varied between 1318\\u202fkm2 (in 1989) to 15.7\\u202fkm2 (in 2013). The monitoring of fires during the recent decade (2005–2014) was observed to have a gradual decline over the reserve. High frequency of fires has been found in dry deciduous forest followed by moist deciduous forest, scrub, grassland and semi-evergreen forest. Among six protected areas, Bandipur National Park had represented more fire incidents followed by Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Nagarhole and Mukurthi National Parks. Grid analysis shows that 67% of the grids were affected by forest fires. Large burnt patches have steadily decreased in their size while the other patch classes showed a significant reduction in their size over the study period. This study had revealed the role of climate and accessibility in relation to fire occurrences. Based on historical burnt area mapping outputs, fire hotspots have been modeled to address fire risk zones. Indeed, the Mann-Kendall trend test has indicated that the overall trend of fire incidents have been declining and this indicates the management effectiveness in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve.'], ['While the collection of fish for the aquarium pet trade has been flagged as a major threat to wild populations, this link is tenuous for the unregulated wild collection of endemic species because of the lack of quantitative data. In this paper, we examine the extent and magnitude of collection and trade of endemic and threatened freshwater fishes from India for the pet markets, and discuss their conservation implications. Using data on aquarium fishes exported from India, we try to understand nature of the trade in terms of species composition, volume, exit points, and importing countries. Most trade in India is carried out under a generic label of “live aquarium fish”; yet despite this fact, we extracted export data for at least thirty endemic species that are listed as threatened in the IUCN Red List. Of the 1.5\\xa0million individual threatened freshwater fish exported, the major share was contributed by three species; Botia striata (Endangered), Carinotetraodon travancoricus (Vulnerable) and the Red Lined Torpedo Barbs (a species complex primarily consisting of Puntius denisonii and Puntius chalakkudiensis, both ‘Endangered’). Using the endangered Red Lined Torpedo Barbs as a case study, we demonstrate how existing local regulations on aquarium fish collections and trade are poorly enforced, and are of little conservation value. In spite of the fact that several threatened and conservation concern species are routinely exported, India has yet to frame national legislation on freshwater aquarium trade. Our analysis of the trade in wild caught freshwater fishes from two global biodiversity hotspots provides a first assessment of the trade in endangered and threatened species. We suggest that the unmanaged collections of these endemic species could be a much more severe threat to freshwater biodiversity than hitherto recognized, and present realistic options for management.'], ['I studied the distribution pattern, population structure and conservation status of rare and endangered medicinal plant species in Spiti sub-division of Himachal Pradesh in the Indian trans-Himalaya. The entire study area was stratified into six zones based on geomorphological and phytogeographical variations. In each zone different habitat types for rare and endangered species were identified and sampled using quadrats. A total of 23 rare and endangered medicinal plants were found in Spiti, distributed over 10 major habitat types. All the rare and endangered medicinal plants were localised and found in patches. The patch size for different species varied greatly from 1 to 20,000 m2. There were large differences in the number of rare and endangered medicinal plant species within different zones of Spiti. More species of rare and endangered medicinal plants occurred close to the Great Himalayan range in the southern part of the study area. The highest mean density was estimated for Picrorhiza kurrooa followed by Saussurea gnaphaloides. The results are discussed in the light of rare and endangered medicinal plants conservation with the strong recommendation of the establishment of medicinal plants conservation areas in this part of trans-Himalaya.'], ['White sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are globally distributed, protected in several countries, including Australia, and potentially dangerous to humans. Following a recent spate of fatal white shark attacks, the Government of Western Australia introduced a range of initiatives to mitigate shark hazards. An increasing trend in shark attacks over the last 20 years has been commonly perceived to be the result of an increase in population abundance since the species’ protection in Australian waters in 1997. We modelled potential population productivity and trajectories using different scenarios of life-history strategies, unexploited population sizes, reconstructed fishery catches and post-capture mortality. Under zero fishing mortality, the potential annual increase in population abundance varied from 2 to 6% per year, depending upon the assumed life history strategy. Depending upon model inputs there was a wide range of potential declines in abundance since 1938/39 and significant differences in the potential population trajectories since protection. However, no scenario (n\\xa0=\\xa0120) resulted in a total population increase of >31% since protection, with most scenarios showing population increase of 10% or less. We present a method for exploring the effects of alternative hypotheses about key population parameters when data are scarce and when scientific advice is required for guiding decision making and informing public debate.'], ['The tropical rainforest in the south-western Ghats of Kerala State was surveyed in May 1993 with the help of trained volunteers and Forest department staff to assess the status and distribution of the endangered lion-tailed macaque Macaca silenus. A total of 564 macaques in 64 troops were sighted during the survey. It is estimated that the number of lion-tailed macaques in Kerala is a minimum of 1216 but only three areas are identified as having viable populations with long-term conservation prospects. Most sightings of troops were in Protected Areas. The present survey indicates its absence in the ranges reported earlier, such as Cardamom Hills and South Wayanad. Maintenance of existing contiguous patches of evergreen forest and inclusion of suitable management strategies in Working Plans for non-Protected Areas are suggested.'], ['National conservation planning should operate with measures of biodiversity similar to those applied globally in order to harmonize national and international conservation strategies. Here we suggest quantitative measures which enable two criteria of the global biodiversity hotspots to be applied on a national level for 74 large countries, and show how these measures can be applied to map national biodiversity hotspots. The plant endemism criteria of global hotspots are captured by quantitative measures of endemism, which are approximately scale-independent and can be corrected to account for a country’s environmental conditions and conservation priorities. The flexible land use criteria for national biodiversity hotspots are defined from percentage of natural vegetation remaining in the global hotspots. The minimum-area-required approach is applied to define the borders of national biodiversity hotspots using data on vascular plants species richness. We show how national biodiversity hotspots can be mapped from the species–energy relationship for vascular plants using climate, topographical and land use data when spatial pattern of species richness is not known. This methodology to map national biodiversity hotspots from abiotic factors is applied to Russia as a case study. Three Russian biodiversity hotspots, North Caucasus, South Siberia and Far East were identified. The resulting hotspot maps cover national-scale environmental gradients across Russia and although they are also identified by Russian experts their actual geographical locations were hitherto unspecified. The large-scale national hotspots, identified for Russia, can be used for further fine scale and more detailed conservation planning.'], ['The relocation and resettlement of people from nature reserves is a controversial issue in the conservation community. The perceived poor success rate of resettlement efforts, combined with availability of few well-documented studies, warrants a detailed examination of this issue. I have analyzed a relocation and resettlement project in India’s Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary. I examine the relocation experience of 419 households who moved to two villages located outside the reserve. I interviewed 61% of relocated households in 2002 and 55% relocated households in 2006. In 2002, 71% of households were satisfied with the relocation effort and their quality of life. In 2006, 52% of households were satisfied with their quality of life. Four years after relocation, all households have access to electricity, water, schools, health care, transportation, and communication facilities. Many households have increased their income and assets. Yet, there were differences between the two different-resettlement villages, with one of them faring better in terms of economics, hardships, and uncertainty. This paper draws out insights important for improving conservation practices related to resettlement efforts. It documents short to mid-term successes and challenges that affect the communities involved. I submit that in specific contexts, relocation may be a viable conservation tool. Successful conservation resettlement requires substantial financial support to meet people’s socio-economic needs, active consultation of the people involved, and partnerships of committed non-governmental and governmental organizations.'], ['Climate change and land-cover change will have major impacts on biodiversity persistence worldwide. These two stressors are likely to interact, but how climate change will mediate the effects of land-cover change remains poorly understood. Here we use an empirically-derived model of the interaction between habitat loss and climate to predict the implications of this for biodiversity loss and conservation priorities at a global scale. Risk analysis was used to estimate the risk of biodiversity loss due to alternative future land-cover change scenarios and to quantify how climate change mediates this risk. We demonstrate that the interaction of climate change with land-cover change could increase the impact of land-cover change on birds and mammals by up to 43% and 24% respectively and alter the spatial distribution of threats. Additionally, we show that the ranking of global biodiversity hotspots by threat depends critically on the interaction between climate change and habitat loss. Our study suggests that the investment of conservation resources will likely change once the interaction between climate change and land-cover change is taken into account. We argue that global conservation efforts must take this into account if we are to develop cost-effective conservation policies and strategies under global change.'], ['Forests and grassy vegetation (savannas and grasslands) are alternative ecosystem states in many tropical landscapes. Relative to forests the grassy ecosystems are poorly known and poorly conserved, partly because they were thought to be products of forest clearance. However many grasslands have proved to be ancient. Commensurate with their antiquity, grassy biomes have distinct suites of plant and animal species that contribute a large fraction of the diversity of forest–grassland mosaics. Grasslands differ strikingly from forests in their ecology and in the nature of threats to their future. Here we highlight the high biodiversity value of grassy biomes and, in contrast to tropical forests, we illustrate the importance of fire in maintaining these systems. We discuss the major threats to, and consequences for, biodiversity in these regions including land clearance and elevated CO2-driven forest expansion. Finally we focus on the difficulties of grassland restoration. A new approach to understanding and conserving grassy ecosystems, free from cultural prejudices of the past, is long overdue.'], ['Rural communities have traditionally valued forests for a diversity of products and services, with timber serving a minor role. No-where has this diversity been greater than in tropical South Asia, and in particular south India and Sri Lanka. As economies advance towards full development and populations become increasingly urbanized, forests become increasingly valued for their services. National development generally occurs at differing rates in different regions, with rural forest dependent communities falling behind and pockets of poverty long remaining. The demand for ‘non-timber forest products’ (NTFPs) therefore changes from subsistence to monetary based values. Overall, though, forests have suffered an unprecedented decline with development in the tropics, especially in Asia. This necessitates restoration which takes account of the enrichment of economy, wellbeing and culture which forest products provide. Methods for such restoration, and the fundamental principles upon which these must rest, are presented for species yielding NTFP’s. In this paper we first review the history of NTFP species use within south India and Sri Lanka. Second we provide a description of the broad regional characterizations of the forest formations within this region in relation to their affiliated patterns of NTFP use and exploitation. We consider seven guilds as a way to categorize NTFP’s into autecological groups for application in restoration silviculture, and use it as a framework to suggest restoration protocols for South Asian forests. We use examples of scenarios based on experimental studies of NTFP’s in reforestation trials which take account of different social values and land tenures. We conclude with a call for further research.'], ['A comprehensive methodology that integrates Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques was adopted to determine the soil erosion vulnerability of a forested mountainous sub-watershed in Kerala, India. The spatial pattern of annual soil erosion rate was obtained by integrating geo-environmental variables in a raster based GIS method. GIS data layers including, rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodability (K), slope length and steepness (LS), cover management (C) and conservation practice (P) factors were computed to determine their effects on average annual soil loss in the area. The resultant map of annual soil erosion shows a maximum soil loss of 17.73\\xa0t h-1 y-1 with a close relation to grass land areas, degraded forests and deciduous forests on the steep side-slopes (with high LS). The spatial erosion maps generated with RUSLE method and GIS can serve as effective inputs in deriving strategies for land planning and management in the environmentally sensitive mountainous areas.'], ['Located in the foothills of the Indian Himalaya, Rajaji National Park was established to protect and enhance the habitat of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and tiger (Panthera tigris). In 2002 the Van Gujjars, indigenous forest pastoralists, were voluntarily resettled from the Chilla Range (an administrative unit of Rajaji National Park) to Gaindikhata, a nearby area where they were granted land for agriculture. In this study we used a variety of remote sensing approaches to identify changes in land cover associated with the resettlement. The methods comprise two main approaches. First, we used object-based image analysis (OBIA) to identify the pre-resettlement land cover classes of use areas (representing agricultural expansion and adjacent areas of grazing, and collection of fuelwood and fodder) and recovery areas (representing areas where settlements were removed, and the adjacent areas of resource use). Secondly, we used trend analysis to assess the gradual and abrupt changes in vegetation that took place in use and recovery areas. To conduct the trend analysis we used BFAST (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend), which separates seasonal variation from long-term trends, and identifies breaks that can be linked back to disturbances or land cover changes. We found that the OBIA classification yielded high average class accuracies, and we were able to make class distinctions that would have been difficult to make using a traditional pixel-based approach. Pre-resettlement, the recovery areas were classified as mixed forest and riparian vegetation. In contrast, the use areas were classified primarily as grass dominated, brush dominated, and plantation forest, and were located relatively far away from riparian areas. Following the resettlement, the trend analysis showed a sudden change in the seasonal variation of NDVI in areas converted to agriculture. Areas neighboring the new agricultural land experienced sudden decreases in NDVI, suggestive of disturbances, at a higher rate than the same land cover types elsewhere. At the same time, these neighboring areas experienced a gradual overall increase in NDVI which could be caused by an expansion of leafy invasive shrubs such as Lantana camara in areas heavily used for biomass collection. The recovery areas also experienced a gradual increase in NDVI as well as sudden breaks to this trend, but we lacked evidence to connect these changes to the resettlement. Our findings support the claim that the resettlement has shifted pressure from more ecologically valuable to less ecologically valuable land cover types, and suggest that to some degree resource use pressure has increased outside the park. The study employs a novel synthesis of OBIA and trend analysis that could be applied to land change studies more broadly.'], ['Water is essential for all living beings. It is a major concern to provide water to all. It is a challenge to supply water to all major cities in Dakshina Kannada district, Karnataka, India. Nethravathi River is one of the major sources of water in the region which yields about 1240TMC per year. Nethravathi River has its origins in Western Ghats of Karnataka flowing to a length of 126 Km and joins Arabian Sea. In Dakshina Kannada district all major cities face water scarcity in summer season even after getting an average annual rainfall of 3.75 – 4.25 m. It is a major challenge to the district administration for providing required water to the people during summer season in spite of plenty of water available during monsoon. This paper highlights in giving solution to this issue after studying various parameters like geographical structure, rainfall data and climate, study of catchment area, storage methods, water demand and water supply schemes available in the region. An attempt has been made to suggest for supplying the water to the cities in Dakshina Kannada district by increasing the storage capacity on the upstream side of the river to get water round the clock.'], ['Forest fragmentation is considered as one of the major conservation issue. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the national assessment of spatial patterns of forest fragmentation and influence of deforestation on fragmentation in the Indian forests during three decade interval (1975-2005). Mapping of forest cover was carried out based on Landsat MSS and IRS P6 AWiFS data using hybrid classification techniques on 1:250,000 scale. The present study considered biogeographic zones as a major stratum for national level assessment. The forest fragmentation was analysed based on landscape indices which allow quantification and categorisation of complex forest landscapes and depict landscape composition, structure and scenario of fragmentation. The analysis revealed that in all biogeographic zones, more than 90% of total number of forest fragments consists of patches having area less than 1\\xa0km2. At national level the mean forest patch size stands at 187\\xa0ha. The total core area was highest for Islands (87.4%) followed by Eastern Himalayas (82.5%), Deccan (78.9%), Deserts (76.4%) and Eastern Ghats (76%). The temporal analysis shows that the loss of Indian forest area as 5.8% during 1975–2005. The annual rate of deforestation has been computed as 0.20% at national level. The decreased mean patch size, increased edge density and increased number of patches from 1975 to 2005 indicates ongoing fragmentation in biogeographic zones. The very high fragmentation in Trans Himalayas is contributed mostly by the natural factors while in other biogeographic zones, increased fragmentation is due to deforestation.'], [\"The nests of the Edible-nest Swiftlet (Collocalia fuciphaga) rank amongst the world's most expensive animal products, which has resulted in high levels of exploitation of its nests in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India. The population of the Edible-nest Swiftlet was assessed through nest counts, and declines in population were estimated through changes in nest yields. The minimum breeding population of C. fuciphaga was estimated to be 13,260 birds, and the species currently bred in 291 caves, and had abandoned 31 caves. Nest collection in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands had taken place in 95% of breeding sites. Less than 2% of the nests counted had either eggs or chicks in them. The decline in swiftlet nest yields in the Andaman islands, between the present and 5–8 years ago (195 caves) has been 61%, and between the present and over 10 years ago (45 caves) has been 83%. Depending on the patterns of nest collection, declines in yield in the Nicobar Islands range between 40 and 95%, with only one cave apparently not having undergone a significant loss. The Edible-nest Swiftlet is critically threatened (IUCN criteria A1c) in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, as it has undergone a reduction in numbers greater than 80% over the last 10 years. To arrest continuing declines, protective measures need to be urgently implemented. Concomitantly, the house farming of the Edible-nest Swiftlet, as has been established in Indonesia, needs to be developed as an ex-situ conservation measure in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\"], ['Calamus thwaitesii Becc. is a potentially useful rattan found in the Western Ghats of India and Sri Lanka. The wild stock of this rattan species is greatly diminished due to overexploitation for the furniture industry and increasingly rare. Genetic diversity was estimated in 80 samples representing eight populations from the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. RAPDs generated a total of 120 markers with 10 decamer primers, of which 85% were found to be polymorphic. The percentage of polymorphic loci varied from 40.00 to 60.83 and genetic distance between populations ranged from 0.0332 to 0.2777. Among the analysed populations, Goa was found to be genetically superior followed by Achenkovil, Sinharaja and Talakkaveri. Majority of the genetic diversity was distributed within populations (70.79%) and only (29.21%) among populations. Genetic relationships estimated by the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averaging (UPGMA) cluster analysis and principal co-ordinate analysis failed to separate Indian and Sri Lankan populations geographically into two distinct groups.'], ['The view that biodiversity-rich areas partially or largely managed by local residents, sometimes referred to as community-conserved areas (CCAs), can be effective in biological conservation has gained considerable ground over the past decade. In this paper, we review available scientific information on the conservation effectiveness of such areas globally. We compiled studies undertaken during the last 5\\xa0years (2004–2009) that use quantifiable ecological attributes to: (1) compare CCAs with strictly protected areas (SPAs); (2) compare CCAs with open-access ecosystems and (3) study trends in biological attributes of CCAs over time. We found that there were few consistent differences in diversity/species richness of flora or fauna protected under the two types of management or in deforestation rates. However, CCAs tend to harbour a species complement distinct from that of SPAs and show lowered abundances of monitored taxa that are of conservation importance. CCAs conserve biological values more effectively than open-access areas. Also, biological values tend to decline in CCAs over time. We conclude that CCAs could represent a significant improvement over open-access areas in terms of conservation effectiveness, yet fall short of the needs of comprehensive biological conservation. While extremely few studies have been undertaken in India, the trends seen largely concur with global ones. This review, based on a limited sample size, is only a beginning, and is expected to serve as an invitation for further research to address both the question of biological effectiveness of diverse forest governance regimes as well as the socio-economic, demographic and institutional reasons underlying these differences.'], ['The southwestern Ghats region of the Indian Peninsula is unique for its extant endemic rainforest flora supported by high rainfall throughout the year. The record of tropical rainforest corresponding to the dynamic series of Pleistocene interglacial/glacial cycles is poorly known from peninsular India. This communication discusses the palynological study of organic matter (OM) deposits (>40\\xa0ka BP) in two well sections (Chaganachery, Kerala) from the Indian Peninsula (west coast). A rich archive of tropical rainforest pollen/spores and marine dinoflagellate cysts indicates anoxic fluvio-marine/estuarine depositional environments during warmer climates with an intensified Asian monsoon. The geochemical fingerprinting of glass shards indicates the presence of Youngest Toba ash of ∼74\\xa0ka from northern Sumatra, and therefore establishes a time-controlled stratigraphy. Thus, the depositional time period of the OM is related to the sea level highstand of Marine Isotopic Stage 5.1 (∼80\\xa0ka) which was the host to the YTT shards. The Late Quaternary pollen/spores diversity suggests that the modern climatic conditions in the southwestern Ghats have facilitated the conservation of moist evergreen rainforest and dry/moist deciduous forest. The pollen grains show its lineage with the extant flora and some of the fossil pollen recorded during the mesic Tertiary period from the Indian peninsula. Thus, it appears that the tropical rainforest survived here as ‘Plant Refugia’ in xeric (glacial) Quaternary periods, perhaps as riparian vegetation, and was rejuvenated during the Holocene as modern extant flora.'], [\"Turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) is an industrially important plant used for production of curcumin, oleoresin and essential oil. In the present study we examined the genetic diversity among turmeric accessions from 10 different agro-climatic regions comprising 5 cultivars and 55 accessions. Two DNA-based molecular marker techniques, viz., random amplified polymorphism DNA (RAPD) and inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) were used to assess the genetic diversity in turmeric genotypes. A total of 17 polymorphic primers (11 RAPDs and 6 ISSRs) were used in this study. RAPD analysis of 60 genotypes yielded 94 fragments of which 75 were polymorphic with an average of 6.83 polymorphic fragments per primer. Number of amplified fragments with RAPD primers ranged from 3 to 13 with the size of amplicons ranging from 230 to 3000\\xa0bp in size. The polymorphism ranged from 45 to 100 with an average of 91.4%. The 6 ISSR primers produced 66 bands across 60 genotypes of which 52 were polymorphic with an average of 8.6 polymorphic fragments per primer. The number of amplified bands varied from 1 to 14 with size of amplicons ranging from 200 to 2000\\xa0bp. The percentage of polymorphism using ISSR primers ranged from 83 to 100 with an average of 95.4%. Nei's dendrogram for 60 samples using both RAPD and ISSR markers demonstrated an extent of 62% correlation between the genetic similarity and geographical location. The result of Nei's genetic diversity (H) generated from the POP gene analysis shows relatively low genetic diversity in turmeric accessions of South eastern ghat (P7), Western undulating zone (P8) with 0.181 and 0.199 value whereas highest genetic diversity (0.257) has been observed in Western central table land (P9). Knowledge on the genetic diversity of turmeric from different agro-climatic regions can be used to future breeding programs for increased curcumin, oleoresin and essential oil production to meet the ever-increasing demand of turmeric for industrial and pharmaceutical uses.\"], ['Rohitukine, a chromane alkaloid, is a precursor of flavopiridol, a promising anti-cancer compound. Currently in Phase III clinical trials, flavopiridol is a potent inhibitor of several cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Rohitukine was first reported from Amoora rohituka (0.083% dry weight) followed by that in Dysoxylum binectariferum (0.9% dry weight), both belonging to the family Meliaceae. Here, we report incredibly high yields of rohitukine (7% dry weight) in trees of D. binectariferum from the Western Ghats, India. Crude extracts of the tree were found to be highly effective against ovarian and breast cancer lines tested.'], [\"Across the globe, catch-and-release (C&R) angling represents a leisure activity indulged by millions. The practice of C&R is commonly advocated by conservation managers because of its potential to protect local fish populations from a range of anthropogenic threats, including over-fishing. In India, C&R angling in fresh waters has a history dating back to colonial times. Despite this, little is known about the current state of the sector. To address this, an online web-based survey was conducted to target C&R anglers who fish in Indian rivers to assess their knowledge, attitudes and perceptions relating to the status of India's freshwater C&R fisheries. From a total of 148 responses, factors such as angling quality (score of 4.6/5.0); aesthetics of surroundings (4.6/5.0), presence of other wildlife (4.4/5.0), fishery management practices (4.6/5.0) and socioeconomic benefits (4.4/5.0) were evaluated. Over 65% (n\\xa0=\\xa0148) of the anglers reported an observed decrease in the quality of fishing (e.g. a reduction in the size and/or numbers of fish available for capture). Respondents also considered deforestation (score of 4.2/5.0), water abstraction (4.4/5.0), pollution (4.4/5.0), hydropower projects (4.2/5.0) and destructive fishing techniques (4.7/5.0) as factors which threaten both the habitat and species they target. C&R practitioners were largely united regarding the benefits and willingness to contribute both their time and financial input to support conservation initiatives (score of 4.7/5.0). The current study provides the first overview of the status of C&R angling in India and explores challenges, opportunities, and priorities for future resource management.\"], ['The species richness and density of lianas (woody vines) in tropical forests is determined by various abiotic and biotic factors. Factors such as altitude, forest patch size and the degree of forest disturbance are known to exert strong influences on liana species richness and density. We investigated how liana species richness and density were concurrently influenced by altitude (1700–2360\\xa0m), forest patch size, forest patch location (edge or interior) and disturbance intensity in the tropical montane evergreen forests, of the Nilgiri and Palni hills, Western Ghats, southern India. All woody lianas (≥1\\xa0cm dbh) were enumerated in plots of 30\\xa0×\\xa030\\xa0m in small, medium and large forest patches, which were located along an altitudinal gradient ranging from 1700 to 2360\\xa0m. A total of 1980 individual lianas were recorded, belonging to 45 species, 32 genera and 21 families, from a total sampling area of 13.86\\xa0ha (across 154 plots). Liana species richness and density decreased significantly with increasing altitude and increased with increasing forest patch size. Within forest patches, the proportion of forest edge or interior habitat influenced liana distribution and succession especially when compared across the patch size categories. Liana species richness and density also varied along the altitudinal gradient when examined using eco-physiological guilds (i.e. shade tolerance, dispersal mode and climbing mechanism). The species richness and density of lianas within these ecological guilds responded negatively to increasing altitude and positively to increasing patch size and additionally displayed differing sensitivities to forest disturbance. Importantly, the degree of forest disturbance significantly altered the relationship between liana species richness and density to increasing altitude and patches size, and as such is likely the primary influence on liana response to montane forest succession. Our findings suggest that managing forest disturbance in the examined montane forests would assist in conserving local liana diversity across the examined altitudinal range.'], [\"A simple and efficient method has been developed for rapid regeneration of plantlets via adventitious bud differentiation on mature seeds of Garcinia indica (Thouars) Choisy, a medicinally important facultative apomictic tropical tree species. High frequency direct shoot proliferation was induced in seed segments cultured on Murashige and Skoog's medium supplemented with cytokinins (BAP, kinetin and TDZ) alone and in combination with auxin (NAA). Amongst the various combinations used, BAP proved to be the most effective. Multiple shoots formed within 4–5 weeks of culture. The shoot forming capacity of the seeds was influenced by the BAP concentration tested (5–50\\xa0μM) and optimal response was observed at different concentrations (12.5–50\\xa0μM) in different genotypes investigated. Significant differences were recorded in terms of percent response (27.78–100%) as well as average number of shoots per explant (3.49–57.67) among the four genotypes investigated. Elongation of the induced shoots was achieved on MS basal medium containing 0.2% activated charcoal. The induction medium had a profound effect on rate of bud elongation with shoots induced on lower concentrations of BAP showing as much as four-fold elongation within 4 weeks. Proliferating shoot cultures were established by repeatedly subculturing the shoot nodes on MS medium supplemented with 5\\xa0μM BAP. Maximum rooting (91.66%) occurred in shoots cultured on half-strength MS medium supplemented with 10\\xa0μM IBA. The plantlets were successfully transferred to soil after hardening; the time period from initiation of shoot buds to transplantation being 15–17 weeks. For in vitro conservation, the shoot cultures were maintained on medium supplemented with 0.5\\xa0μM BAP and the subculture duration could be enhanced up to maximum of 11 months.\"], ['In an era of human activities, global environmental changes, habitat loss and species extinction, conservation strategies are a crucial step toward minimizing biodiversity loss. For instance, oceans acidification and land use are intensifying in many places with negative and often irreversible consequences for biodiversity. Biodiversity hotspots, despite some criticism, have become a tool for setting conservation priorities and play an important role in decision-making for cost-effective strategies to preserve biodiversity in terrestrial and, to some extent, marine ecosystems. This area-based approach can be applied to any geographical scale and it is considered to be one of the best approaches for maintaining a large proportion of the world’s biological diversity. However, delineating hotspots includes quantitative criteria along with subjective considerations and the risk is to neglect areas, such as coldspots, with other types of conservation value. Nowadays, it is widely acknowledged that biodiversity is much more than just the number of species in a region and a conservation strategy cannot be based merely on the number of taxa present in an ecosystem. Therefore, the idea that strongly emerges is the need to reconsider conservation priorities and to go toward an interdisciplinary approach through the creation of science-policy partnerships.'], ['Gaultheria (Ericaceae), a perennial woody genus, comprises of approximately 200 species, is distributed in the temperate and tropical regions of the world. Although majority of them are diploids with basic chromosome number of n\\xa0=\\xa011, some species are tetraploid or hexaploid. The genus is known for Gaultheria procumbens and Gaultheria fragrantissima for the production of “oil of wintergreen” which is used for antimicrobial, insecticidal, and antioxidant properties, and hence these two species have been investigated relatively more than other species. Most importantly, the plants of this genus contain higher levels of salicylic acid within the plant kingdom. Only limited information is available on biotechnological aspects; other investigations have however, concentrated on identification and quantification of chemical compounds from the genus at the species level, or to evaluate their pharmacological activities. Being vulnerable and economically important due to rich source of natural salicylic acid, G. fragrantissima (Wall.) has drawn much attention in the recent times, and hence there is an urgent need for biotechnological interventions not only for its conservation but also for bioprospecting its genome resources. Studies on phytochemical and pharmacological characteristics have been recently reviewed, therefore in this communication, an attempt has been made to depict the recent advances in various biotechnological aspects aimed for the conservation and varietal improvement of G. fragrantissima.'], ['The rheophilous tadpoles of the rare and endangered Purple frog, Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis (Biju and Bossuyt, 2003), have suctorial mouthparts that enable them to occupy a very unique microhabitat within torrential streams. In this study, we examined the influence of four stream habitat variables, i.e. water flow velocity, slope of substrate, depth of water column and water temperature, on the distribution and abundance of these tadpoles. A total of 204 measurements were recorded for all the four variables in 68 marked grids along a 100 m section of two selected streams. Statistical analysis showed that water flow velocity was the best predictor for abundance of tadpoles in both streams. When the number of tadpoles was modeled as a function of each environmental variable, the relationship ranged from linear (w.r.t water flow velocity and water temperature) to unimodal humped curves (w.r.t slope of substrate and depth of water column). The results were further assessed with respect to distribution and behavioral observations of the tadpoles in the streams as well as to the threat posed by dams and reservoirs on tadpole microhabitats.'], ['In India, sacred groves have been considered the forested abodes of one or multiple deities and are often managed by communal governance systems. As land development has progressed, the population surrounding these and other green spaces has changed, and responsibility for their protection has shifted to the bureaucracies that manage urban environments. The sacred grove now means different things to different people, and the value of its protection is increasingly difficult to characterize. In this context, we study individual preferences for sacred groves and non-forested temples along an urbanization gradient –defined by land use– in rural locales near the megacity of Delhi, informed by the theoretical perspective of Sanskritization. We use revealed and stated preference data that includes information on visits to forests and worship sites, weighting for relevant forest characteristics, and socio-demographic factors related to culture. Respondents generally place higher value on sacred groves than on non-sacred green space, but more urbanized and sanskritized individuals exhibit higher valuations for non-forested temples and conservation of urban green space. Taken together, these results suggest a potential increase in the perception of non-sacred and non-use forest value among urbanized respondents.'], ['Nepal is located in the central part of the greater Himalayan range with a unique series of mountain chains formed by recent mountain building geological events. As one of the youngest mountains in the world it contributes to diversity of plants and also provided barriers to and corridors through which plants migrated during the ice ages. The higher altitudinal variation with the high mountains, deep river valleys and lowland plains combine with the effects of the summer monsoon and dry winter result with an extraordinary diversity of ecosystems including flora and fauna in a relatively small land area. The existing checklists for Nepal record some 6000 species of flowering plants and about 530 ferns. However, the botanical experts estimate that numbers may go up to 7000 when the poorly known remote regions are fully explored. The information on plant endemism in Nepal Himalaya is not adequately known as Nepal is still struggling to complete long awaited Flora of Nepal project. Endemic species are confined to specific areas and are the first to be affected by land use and other global changes. We sought to explore the spatial distribution of endemic plant species in Nepal in relation to the consequences associated with climatic and geologic changes over time in the region with the help of published literature. It was found that the endemism showed marked spatial variation between open moist habitat and dry inner valleys, the former with higher endemism. The updated records showed 312 flowering plant species to be endemic to Nepal with higher endemism around the elevation of 3800–4200\\xa0m at sea level. The recent human population explosion, intensified deforestation, habitat fragmentation and modern day environmental changes are posing greater threats to endemic plant in Nepal. The conservation status and threats to these peculiar species are unknown. Nevertheless, environmental degradation and high poverty rates create a potent mix of threats to biodiversity in this landscape.'], ['This paper describes how a green energy surplus region changed over the years to a thermal energy-mix, driven by environmentalist forces’ strong opposition to Hydro-Electric Power Projects (HEPPs) in Kerala, India. The specific instance of the proposed Athirappilly HEPP is discussed against the background of the opposition of environmentalists and other sympathetic associations. The strong opposition to HEPPs in specific local contexts has led to increased emissions in other places. The tenets of Energy Justice – distributional, procedural, recognition and cosmopolitan – have been challenged by the environmentalists’ movement against the Athirappilly HEPP. The inherent conflicts between Environment Law and Climate Law on the one hand and the principles of Energy Justice and Law on the other are pointed out. The concept of “Power-Environ” is introduced and characterized, and its relation to Energy Justice and Law is explored in the policy context. The concept proposed here serves as a foundation for realizing parsimonious and effective representation of the opposition to HEPPs, and ushering Energy Justice and Law. The use of this concept, as an integrated whole founded on the principles of Energy Justice and Law, should facilitate balanced policy-making in the Energy sector, especially in India and hopefully across the world too.'], ['Soil erosion contributes negatively to agricultural production, quality of source water for drinking, ecosystem health in land and aquatic environments, and aesthetic value of landscapes. Approaches to understand the spatial variability of erosion severity are important for improving landuse management. This study uses the Kelani river basin in Sri Lanka as the study area to assess erosion severity using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model supported by a GIS system. Erosion severity across the river basin was estimated using RUSLE, a Digital Elevation Model (15\\u202f×\\u202f15\\u202fm), twenty years rainfall data at 14 rain gauge stations across the basin, landuse and land cover, and soil maps and cropping factors. The estimated average annual soil loss in Kelani river basin varied from zero to 103.7\\u202ft ha-1\\u202fyr−1, with a mean annual soil loss estimated at 10.9\\u202ft ha−1 yr−1. About 70% of the river basin area was identified with low to moderate erosion severity (<12\\u202ft ha−1\\u202fyr−1) indicating that erosion control measures are urgently needed to ensure a sustainable ecosystem in the Kelani river basin, which in turn, is connected with the quality of life of over 5 million people. Use of this severity information developed with RUSLE along with its individual parameters can help to design landuse management practices. This effort can be further refined by analyzing RUSLE results along with Kelani river sub-basins level real time erosion estimations as a monitoring measure for conservation practices.'], ['The quantitative liana inventories made in five peninsular Indian independent forest sites, distributed in the Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats and on the Coromandel coast, were examined particularly with reference to site altitude and forest stature. Liana diversity totaled 148 species in 101 genera of 47 families, in a total sample of 47\\xa0ha. The coefficient of variability in species distribution among the five sites was used to identify an oligarchy in liana species by taking 55 abundant species from the species pool. Ordination analysis, based on presence–absence as well as relative density of liana species indicated a geographical differentiation among the five sites in both the ordinations with respect to site altitude. Liana density (stems>1.6\\xa0cm diameter) decreased with increasing altitude, whereas richness was highest at intermediate elevations. The mean liana density across the forest sites showed a weak negative correlation with forest stature. The lianas encountered in the five study sites fell under six climber types, of which twining was the chief climbing mechanism, both in terms of species diversity and density, and tendril climbers were more abundant in dry evergreen forests than in the wet evergreen forests. In liana diaspore dispersal modes, the majority of evergreen forest species possessed animal dispersal guilds, whereas wind-dispersal was prevalent in semi-evergreen and dry evergreen forests.'], ['There is an urgent need for techniques to rapidly and periodically measure biodiversity and ecosystem services over large landscapes. Conventional vegetation classification and mapping approaches are based on discrete arbitrary classes which do not capture gradual changes in forest type (and corresponding biodiversity and ecosystem services values) from site to site. We developed a simple multi-date NDVI based Mahalanobis distance measure (called eco-climatic distance) that quantifies forest type variability across a moisture gradient for complex tropical forested landscapes on a single ecologically interpretable, continuous scale. This Mahalanobis distance, unlike other distance measures takes into account the variability in the reference class and shared information amongst bands as it is based on the covariance matrix, and therefore is most useful to summarize ecological distance of a pixel to a reference class in multi-band remotely sensed space In this study we successfully apply this measure as a surrogate for tree biodiversity and ecosystem services at two nested scales for the Western Ghats Bio-diversity hotspot. Data from over 500 tree-plots and forest type maps was used to test the ability of this remotely sensed distance to be a surrogate for abundance based tree-species compositional turn-over and as a continuous measure of forest type and ecosystem services. Our results suggest a strong but scale dependant relationship between the remotely-sensed distance measure and floristic distance between plots. The multi-date NDVI distance measure emerges as very good quantitative surrogate for forest type and is a useful complement to existing forest classification systems. This surrogate quantifies forest type variability on a single, continuous quantitative scale and has important applications in conservation planning and mapping and monitoring of hydrologic and carbon storage and sequestration services.'], ['Rauvolfia species are important medicinal plants due to the presence of bioactive indole alkaloids, especially reserpine. Reserpine content in the roots of six Rauvolfia species (R. hookeri, R. micrantha, R. serpentina, R. tetraphylla, R. verticillata, and R. vomitoria), were detected by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrapole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI-QToF-MS/MS) and estimated by validated high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) method. Reserpine has positively been identified in the crude alkaloid extracts through HPLC–ESI-QToF-MS/MS method by exact mass, isotopic peak pattern, tandem mass fragmentation pattern, and with authentic standard match. Excellent separation of reserpine was achieved in HPTLC using the solvent system hexane:acetone:methanol (6:3.5:0.5, v/v). The HPTLC estimation method was validated in terms of linearity, specificity, detection limit, quantitation limit, precision, accuracy, and repeatability. Among the six Rauvolfia species, reserpine content was highest in the exotic species R. vomitoria (689.5\\xa0μg/g, dry wt.), while among the five Indian species the highest reserpine content was for R. tetraphylla (450.7\\xa0μg/g, dry wt.). In the most common Indian Rauvolfia species, R. serpentina, the reserpine content was comparatively low (254.8\\xa0μg/g, dry wt.). The endemic species R. micrantha possesses significant quantity of reserpine (422.1\\xa0μg/g, dry wt.), making it a potential candidate for developing as a source of reserpine, replacing R. serpentina and R. tetraphylla that are endangered due to over exploitation.'], ['Embelia ribes Burm. f. belongs to the family Myrsinaceae found in hilly parts of India up to 1500 m. elevation from outer Himalayas to Western Ghats.

Because of this activity, several semi-synthetic derivatives of CPT are in clinical use against ovarian and small lung cancers. Together with its derivatives, CPT is the third largest anti-cancer drug in the world market. CPT is produced by several plant species belonging to the Asterid clade. In the recent past, several studies have reported the production of CPT by endophytic fungal associates of some of these plant species. In this paper, we report the production of CPT by endophytic bacteria isolated from Miquelia dentata Bedd. (Icacinaceae). Besides CPT, the bacteria also produced 9-methoxy CPT (9-MeO-CPT), in culture, independent of the host tissue. The chemical nature of CPT and 9-MeO-CPT was determined by LC–MS and ESI-MS/MS analysis, and was shown to be similar to that produced by the host tissue. One of the bacterial isolates examined, showed indications of attenuation of CPT production through sub-culture. This is the first report of production of CPT by endophytic bacteria. The identity of the bacteria was ascertained by Gram staining and 16s rRNA sequencing. We discuss the possible mechanisms that might be involved in the synthesis of CPT by endophytic bacteria.'], ['Soil erosion is a serious problem arising from agricultural intensification, land degradation and other anthropogenic activities. Assessment of soil erosion is useful in planning and conservation works in a watershed or basin. Modelling can provide a quantitative and consistent approach to estimate soil erosion and sediment yield under a wide range of conditions. In the present study, the soil loss model, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with GIS has been used to estimate soil loss in the Nethravathi Basin located in the southwestern part of India. The Nethravathi Basin is a tropical coastal humid area having a drainage area of 3128\\xa0km2 up to the gauging station. The parameters of RUSLE model were estimated using remote sensing data and the erosion probability zones were determined using GIS. The estimated rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, topographic and crop management factors range from 2948.16 to 4711.4\\xa0MJ/mm·ha−1hr−1/year, 0.10 to 0.44\\xa0t\\xa0ha−1·MJ−1·mm−1, 0 to 92,774 and 0 to 0.63 respectively. The results indicate that the estimated total annual potential soil loss of about 473,339\\xa0t/yr is comparable with the measured sediment of 441,870\\xa0t/yr during the water year 2002–2003. The predicted soil erosion rate due to increase in agricultural area is about 14,673.5\\xa0t/yr. The probability zone map has been derived by the weighted overlay index method indicate that the major portion of the study area comes under low probability zone and only a small portion comes under high and very high probability zone. The results can certainly aid in implementation of soil management and conservation practices to reduce the soil erosion in the Nethravathi Basin.'], ['Protected areas are essential for both conservation of biodiversity and provisioning of dynamic ecosystem services. In recent years, invasive plant species have had devastating impacts on the sustenance of natural habitat for the in-situ conservation of threatened species. In the present study, we investigated the distribution pattern of Chromolaena odorata and Mikania micrantha and factors governing their spread in the grassland of Manas National Park. We carried out extensive field sampling and modeled the distribution of invasives using a suite of algorithms. Model predictions differed with respect to AUC, sensitivity, specificity and TSS range, largely in classification performance. Final risk maps were produced averaging the model outputs of Random Forest and MaxEnt for both the species. Subsequently, we also emphasized that the niche/SDM modelling studies should instigate by testing a suite of algorithms for predictive ability under the specific conditions of the study since no single optimization approach would be best under all circumstances. Proximity to the road and human settlement, elevation, fire occurrence and precipitation of driest quarter were the key predictors for both the invasive. The potential area invaded by the C. odorata was 74.87\\u202fsq.\\u202fkm and M. micarantha 81.82\\u202fsq.\\u202fkm, and a high degree of overlap found between the distributions of both the species. Invasion risk maps can be used as an early detection tool for the management of invasive species, which could help in minimizing the ecological significance and economic cost of invasions.

The optimum callusing was observed when internode explants were cultured on MS medium augmented with 4.0\\xa0μM 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2, 4-D) and 0.5\\xa0μM kinetin (Kn). The calli were subcultured on MS medium supplemented with various concentrations of N6-benzylaminopurine (BA; 1.0-5.0\\xa0μM) or Kn (1.0-5.0\\xa0μM) alone or in combination with naphthalene acetic acid (NAA; 0.5-1.5\\xa0μM) for shoot regeneration. The highest shoot regeneration in terms of percent response (100%) and number of shoots (89.3) was observed on MS medium supplemented with 4.0\\xa0μM BA and 1.0\\xa0μM NAA. The best rooting was observed on half strength MS medium augmented with 0.6\\xa0μM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). On this medium, 100% shoots rooted with an average number of 6.8 roots per shoot. The rooted shoots were transplanted to soil and acclimatized successfully. Of the 80 plants transplanted to soil 72 survived. Inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis clearly indicated that callus derived plants of T. bicolor resembled the parent plant at the genetic level.

Much of this reforestation occurred during the 1970s and 1980s. The ecological literature suggests that in many temperate broadleaf forest regions pine is an important component of early succession on old fields, beneath which second growth hardwood can establish and eventually dominate. More recent studies have demonstrated the establishment of native rain forest regeneration beneath a variety of exotic tree plantations. We review nearly twenty-five years of research on this topic for South Asia through a series of studies done in southwest Sri Lanka. Results demonstrate that native species recruitment of both pioneers and site generalist late-successional trees grow well beneath exotic pine plantations. Diversity and density increase from plantation interior to edge. Protection from groundstory fire is the single most important component of promoting regeneration recruitment beneath pine. Establishing late-successional site and dispersal restricted species requires planting beneath pine rather than reliance on natural establishment. Best establishment and growth occur in openings where rows of canopy pine have been removed. Species considered for planting comprise the major late-successional canopy tree species of the forest in the genera Dipterocarpus, Shorea (Dipterocarpaceae) and Mesua (Clusiaceae). Native species that produce non-timber forest products (NTFP) need to be planted with best results in canopy openings. The most valuable NTFP’s comprise a sugar palm (Caryota urens), rattan (Calamus spp.) and a medicinal liana (Coscinium fenestratum). Financial analyses reveal that pine plantations that are enrichment planted and cultivated with rain forest timber and non-timber species can provide superior economic benefits as compared to land cultivated singly for tea.'], ['Camptothecin and 10-hydroxycamptothecin are two important precursors for the synthesis of the clinically useful anticancer drugs, topotecan and irinotecan. In recent years, efforts have been made to identify novel plant and endophytic fungal sources of camptothecin and 10-hydroxycamptothecin. In this study we have isolated endophytic fungi strains from Apodytes dimidiata (Icacinaceae), a medium sized tree from the Western Ghats, India. The fungi were identified as Fusarium solani using both ITS rDNA sequencing and spore morphology. Two strains, MTCC 9667 and MTCC 9668 were isolated, both of which produced camptothecin and 9-methoxycamptothecin in their mycelia; one of the strains, MTCC 9668 also produced 10-hydroxycamptothecin, though in small amounts. The yields of camptothecin in MTCC 9667 and MTCC 9668 were 37 and 53\\xa0μg/100\\xa0g, respectively, after 4\\xa0days of incubation in broth culture.

Here, we present fossil pollen data and examine their climatic interpretation based on a 200-cm-deep trenched sedimentary profile from Mahanadi river side, located near the Barpahar hillock of Bargarh District, Odisha, which is influenced by the South-west and North-east monsoon. The 5840\\xa0y chronology of the sediment core is based on three 14C dates on soil samples. During 5840–4380\\xa0BP, dense tropical mixed deciduous forest consisting of Madhuca, Syzygium and Acacia flourished in the region along with Rhizophora under a warm and humid climate governed by high monsoonal activity. This phase of climate is associated with the Holocene Climatic Optimum which falls within the temporal range of 8000–5000\\xa0BP. Subsequently, an increase in humidity was discerned between 4380 and 3230\\xa0BP, as evident by increase in forest elements, under warm and relatively humid climate in response to an increased monsoon. The climate during 3230–1860\\xa0BP was mild and in general less humid than today. This climate event was inevitably influenced by a notable global cold event 4200 years ago, which is synchronous with the collapse of the world's first human empire in Mesopotamia. After this event, there was a return of more humid climate from 1860 to 1300\\xa0BP, marked by high values of Potamogeton, Myriophyllum, Nymphoides, and fungal and trilete fern spores. This is further supported by the presence of Rhizophora and Sonneratia indicating high precipitation under the influence of coastal habitation. A striking signal of the Little Ice age (LIA) was observed since 1300\\xa0BP when the climate became relatively dry, as recognized in a sudden decline in major arboreals, along with high frequency of occurrence of dry herbs. This changing pattern of humidity was also reflected in the proportions of marshy/aquatic taxa, as well as ruderal taxa which is a result of human impact. The study will be helpful to display the palaeovegetation and climate in the region between Bengal and the Ganga plain.\"], [\"Ecohydrological modelling and prescribing environmental flows (e-flows) is significant in the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) practice.

The monthly e-flow regimes required to maintain alternate levels of ecosystem conservation are estimated in this paper. The additional flood flow volume required for these alternate levels is also discussed. The results are useful in the stakeholder engagement process for informed decision-making on e-flows and redefining the IBWT operations within a broad framework of IWRM.\"], [\"Application of remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) as a tool has assumed an immense significance in habitat suitability modelling for various wildlife species and now a days these are widely used in conservation biology and wildlife management.This paper evaluates habitat suitability for tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) in Chandoli National Park, India. This research provides information about potential areas that can be declared as Tiger Reserve, a federal designation of protection. Habitat evaluation was completed in the Chandoli National Park (17° 04′ 00″ N to 17° 19′ 54″ N and 73° 40′ 43″ E to 73° 53′ 09″ E) using habitat suitability index (HSI). Remotely sensed data of satellite IRS-P6, LISS-III of 25th February 2005 was procured from National Remote Sensing Agency, India. The satellite imagery data was digitally processed and collateral data were generated from topographic maps in a GIS framework. Various layers of different variables such as landuse land cover, forest density, measures of proximity to disturbances and water resources and a digital terrain model were created based on ground truthing. These layers, GPS location of animal's presence and “binomial multiple logistic regression (BMLR)” techniques were integrated in a GIS environment for the HSI modelling.Results indicate that approximately 160.48\\xa0km2 (55%) of the forest of Chandoli National Park is highly suitable for herbivores population, and 176.52\\xa0km2 (50%) of the Park is suitable for tigers. Therefore, this study concludes that forest areas within the Chandoli National Park are appropriate for consideration as Tiger Reserve.Furthermore, the identification and mapping of wildlife corridors and other forest patches lying in between neighboring protected area like Koyana sanctuary, suggests that these region of Sahyadri range of Western Ghats should be included into the proposed Tiger Reserve. This will be a benefit for tigers, as tigers require larger and least disturbed forest habitats for establishing and maintaining their high-density population. Fortunately, in May 2008 the Government of India declared Chandoli NP as tiger reserve. Thus declaration of Chandoli National Park as a Tiger Reserve reflects that the habitat suitability model developed by us for tiger was not only statistically sound but also has potential to be considered while taking any decision regarding wildlife habitat management.\"], ['In Eravikulam National Park, India, Nilgiri tahr Hemitragus hylocrius frequent the fringes of the grass-covered plateau. The two main types of grassland utilised by tahr were dominated by Eulalia phaeothrix and Andropogon polyptichus.The total wild population of Nilgiri tahr is about 2200. Available evidence suggests that the three largest populations have remained approximately stable in recent years. Annual mortality at Eravikulam NP was estimated to be 44–52% for young, 31–37% for yearlings, and 17–24% for adults. Life expectancy at birth was estimated at 3–3·5 years. There was evidence for mortality incurred by predation, disease, accidents, injury during intraspecific combat, and thermal stress.Relevant to conservation are the short life expectancy of Nilgiri tahr; the need for comparable information on size and structure of all extant populations; and the effect of weather patterns on the temporal distribution of births and census results.'], [\"ObjectivePresent study reports the various factors affecting somatic embryogenesis and in\\xa0vitro flowering in Hybanthus enneaspermus (L.)

New technologies alone do not save species, and new data create new problems. For example, improving technologies alone cannot prevent poaching: solutions require providing appropriate tools to the right people. Habitat loss is another driver: the challenge here is to connect existing sophisticated remote sensing with species occurrence data to predict where species remain. Other challenges include assembling a wider public to crowdsource data, managing the massive quantities of data generated, and developing solutions to rapidly emerging threats.'], ['Biological invasions by alien non-indigenous species are one of the major problems of the present era which impose massive environmental and socio-economic costs. In India about 40% of the floral species have long been recognized to be aliens, but the need for priority conservation efforts has only been felt since the turn of the century. Thus, it is now of utmost importance to predict the potential distribution of invasive alien species and identify suitable environmental conditions that allow the species to spread rapidly.The invasive plant Mikania micrantha was chosen as the test species. Native occurrence records (longitude and latitude) were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). For Indian occurrences, GBIF records were supplemented with occurrences from herbaria label data and information gathered from published literature. Nineteen climatic variables were obtained from World-Clim databse.To predict the potential distribution, species distribution models (SDMs) were built by using logistic regression and the climatic variables were chosen by using two cross-validated regularization methods induced by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) and the ridge penalty function. This approach has twofold benefits; it deals with the multicollinearity problem efficiently and selects the raw environmental covariates. Fβ-score was utilized to measure the models’ performance. Combining the data from both native and alien ranges, seven environmental predictors were selected using four different background choices. Using lasso penalty, mean diurnal range (mean of monthly (max temp – min temp)) (BIO2), Isothermality (BIO2/BIO7) (×100) (BIO3), Temperature Annual Range (BIO5-BIO6) (BIO7), Precipitation of Wettest Month (BIO13), Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation) (BIO15) and Precipitation of Warmest Quarter (BIO18) were found to be strong correlates for all four backgrounds. The predicted probabilities from the model containing these seven selected variables, demonstrated higher invasion risk in the central part of India than the model containing all the predictors.Accurate analysis of present distributions and effective predictive modelling of future distributions of invasive alien species is of vital importance for the early detection of the invasion and rapid remedial actions downstream. This study may aid in the adoption of management initiatives like early detection and rapid response. This could result in identifying both new populations and established populations to be prioritized for management.'], ['This study assessed the spatial patterns of significant negative trend of forest seasonal greenness over the different forest types of India using 8-day composite MODIS NDVI (500\\xa0m) time series data (2001–2014). It was further analyzed to quantify the negative changes in the core forest areas and to indentify hotspots of it over the large protected forest areas. Significant negative changes in the seasonal greenness were found to be highest over tropical moist deciduous forest (2067.35 thousand ha) followed by tropical dry deciduous (1407.73 thousand ha), tropical wet evergreen (577.43 thousand ha), tropical semi evergreen (442.58 thousand ha), subtropical broad leaved (321.13 thousand ha) and Himalayan moist temperate forest (293.80 thousand ha). Mangroves forest also showed decrease in its greenness over 15.6% of its total area. Interestingly, most of the observed negative changes of high to medium magnitude were found in the core areas of the forest types. Hotspots analysis revealed spatially coherent significant negative changes of seasonal greenness over the large protected areas i.e. Similipal wildlife sanctuary of Odisha, Rajaji national park of Uttarakhand, Achanakmar wildlife sanctuary of Chhattisgarh and Sundarban of West Bengal. The outcomes of the present study would help in the prioritization of the forest types and protected forest areas for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation programmes.'], [\"accelerating local and global environmental change threatens societal well-being now and in the future in a variety of ways, especially in developing countries. A necessary condition for responding adequately to this environmental crisis is the generation of knowledge that speaks to policy and action, and is holistic, not fragmented along disciplinary lines. The idea of interdisciplinary applied research on the environment has been around since the early 1970s and has taken different institutional forms and labels. In developing countries such as India, the academic community has generally ‘disciplined’ environmental pedagogy into environmental ‘science’ programs, and academic research also continues largely on disciplinary lines. We review the experience of the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bangalore, India, that was set up almost two decades ago as an effort to institutionalize an interdisciplinary and problem-oriented research and teaching paradigm. One key element of this effort has been an explicitly normative but broad set of concerns, including equity and democratic governance as integral aspects of conservation and sustainability. Another has been an emphasis on balancing academic rigor with social relevance, the latter achieved not just by speaking to policy makers, but by building collaborations with local communities and activist groups in a number of field sites. Finally, building an explicitly interdisciplinary PhD programme in spite of significant resource and other constraints has built a common perspective. In our analysis, we highlight factors that influence success, including clarity and a common understanding of the mission, human resources, resolution of perennial tensions between disciplinary and interdisciplinary work, commitment to the program structure, program and institutional leadership, and the framework for rewards and incentives. Availability of resources, political support, and the willingness of the state to accept and recognize the work of non-state actors are other major factors. ATREE's experience offers important insights to the conceptualization and implementation of sustainability studies programs elsewhere.\"], ['Sacred natural sites are considered an additional pillar for biodiversity conservation, next to the protected areas network. However, sacred landscapes are not primarily conservation areas, but exist for cultural and social reasons. To evaluate their strengths and weaknesses as community-based conservation areas, a thorough understanding of the underlying values, institutional arrangements, and outcomes is required. Here, I use institutional economics for a meta-analysis of publications on sacred natural sites to identify potential conflicts in their maintenance, and to analyze institutional arrangements to solve these conflicts. I show that most sacred natural sites resemble common-pool resources and that many design principles that are linked to common-pool resources are also found in traditional institutions managing sacred places. Design principles are no blue-print solution but they may guide future research to identify locally robust institutional arrangements that are linked to the ecological integrity of sacred natural sites.'], ['The success of incorporating natural capital into resource- and land-use decisions hinges on the ability to quantify the ecosystem services, forecast the returns to the investments, convert these values into effective policy and finance mechanisms, and the presence of well-functioning institutions and infrastructure. However, ecosystem production functions i.e., the relationship between regulatory functions of the ecosystem and the economic activity it protects or supports are often poorly understood. Even with respect to Forest Watershed Services – a service that is widely recognized and even institutionalized through market based mechanisms in some parts of the world – the biophysical relationships between forests and services such as stream flow stabilization, water quality and water quantity are undefined, particularly for the tropics. For this reason, this study through time series data and multivariate analysis characterizes the relationships between Forest Cover (all lands with tree cover of a canopy density of 10% and above when projected vertically on the horizontal ground with minimum areal extent of 1\\xa0ha), water quality and cost of water treatment in the Western Ghats of peninsular India. In particular, the recursive relationship between the economic and environmental components is estimated by tracing the effects through the two-stage model. Annual value of impacts (increased ‘treatment cost’, increased ‘water losses due to backwash and desludging’, and changes in ‘water yield’) induced by loss of Forest Cover is estimated as 64.96 Indian rupee/m3 treated water/ha/year ($1.32/m3 treated water/ha/year). At an annual rate of change in the forest cover by −0.0088% (average annual rate of change in the forest cover between the years 1994–2007) the deforestation induced costs translate to 3.73 million Indian rupee/year ($0.075\\xa0million/year) according to the 2010–2011 prices for the Panjrapur treatment plant of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. Thus, if deforestation is avoided the Municipal Corporation can save significant amount towards recurring costs of water treatment and to some extent mitigate the costs for the development of a new source.'], ['Exponential growth of population and the resultant rapid rate of urbanization and industrialization in India have significantly transformed its nighttime light environment. The study makes an attempt to analyze the spatio-temporal pattern of light pollution and its causative actors in a fast-developing economy. We utilized nighttime light data from 1993 to 2013 and calibrated through linear regression. Ten patches of major changes from the whole study area were selected to assess the intensity of light pollution at regional scale. Spatial analysis of light pollution in selected patches revealed that New Delhi, Telangana, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh experienced increase in very high light pollution intensity. West Bengal, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu witnessed a remarkable change from low to high light pollution. Urban expansion, industrial development and air pollution are main drivers for increasing light pollution. Strong correlation was found between light pollution and digital numbers (DN) values at regional scale. The maps generated through Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Line Scanner Night Time Light data not only helped in assessing the intensity of light pollution but also identified its causative actors.The results of study can effectively be utilized for setting priorities of environmental protection in different geographical regions at various scales.'], ['In an effort to prioritize conservation efforts, scientists have developed the concept of biodiversity hotspots. Since most hotspots occur in countries where poverty is widespread, the success of conservation efforts depends upon the recognition that poverty can be a significant constraint on conservation, and at the same time conservation is an important component to the alleviation of long-term poverty. In this paper we present five key socio-economic poverty indicators (access to water, undernourishment, potential population pressure, number living below poverty line and debt service) and integrate them with an ecologically based hotspots analysis in order to illustrate magnitude of the overlap between biological conservation and poverty. The analysis here suggests that the overlap between severe, multifaceted poverty and key areas of global biodiversity is great and needs to be acknowledged. Understanding the magnitude of overlap and interactions among poverty, conservation and macroeconomic processes is crucial for identifying illusive, yet possible, win–win solutions.'], ['embers of the kingdoms Chromista, Fungi s.str. and Protozoa studied by mycologists, have received scant consideration in discussions on biodiversity. The number of known species is about 69 000, but that in the world is conservatively estimated at 1·5 million; six-times higher than hitherto suggested. The new world estimate is primarily based on vascular plant: fungus ratios in different regions. It is considered conservative as: (1) it is based on the lower estimates of world vascular plants; (2) no separate provision is made for the vast numbers of insects now suggested to exist; (3) ratios are based on areas still not fully known mycologically; and (4) no allowance is made for higher ratios in tropical and polar regions. Evidence that numerous new species remain to be found is presented. This realization has major implications for systematic manpower, resources, and classification. Fungi have and continue to play a vital role in the evolution of terrestrial life (especially through mutualisms), ecosystem function and the maintenance of biodiversity, human progress, and the operation of Gaia. Conservation in situ and ex situ are complementary, and the significance of culture collections is stressed.

Our results suggest that a three-tier setup involving local communities and civil society organizations, supported by enabling government policies is most efficacious in mainstreaming socio-economic development of local communities and environmental concerns in tourism management framework. Strong local institutions with intrinsic spatial linkage are required to ensure maximum benefits to all sections of society and least monetary leakages.

Many tourist destinations and religious enclaves in developing countries are inside protected areas (PA). They are well connected by roads and attract thousands of visitors. The effect of such large human congregations inside PA on biodiversity is not well understood. Here, we address the impacts of increased vehicular traffic due to religious tourism on local fauna inside the Kalakad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in south India. We sampled sections of surfaced roads for mortalities before and during an annual festival across three habitats in 2008 and 2009. Millipedes, anurans, insects and reptiles dominated the mortalities and mammals avoided the roads. A total of 1413 individuals belonging to 56 species were killed on roads. Nocturnal species constituted 50% of these mortalities and 64% of the species composition. There was a 299% increase in road mortalities and 648% increase in nocturnal species mortality during the festival compared to those before the festival. Mean mortalities varied across habitats and were highest in moist deciduous forests. Mortalities were influenced significantly by vehicular traffic rather than rainfall. Indications of a temporary local extinction were evident beyond certain threshold of vehicular movement. The number of vehicles plying on the roads was three times higher than the threshold level as determined in this study. The festival also had a spillover effect by causing increased mortalities on roads not connected to the temple. We discuss several strategies to minimize impacts due to large scale vehicular movement inside protected areas.'], [\"The present study, first of its kind, has analyzed the land cover and investigated the spatial patterns of deforestation and forest fragmentation in South Asian region since the 1930's. This region comprises of eight countries: India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Maldives. In South Asia, agricultural land is predominant constituting 43% of the total geographical area followed by barren land (19.99%) and forests (14.72%). The long-term change analysis using the classified maps of 1930 and 2014 indicated a loss of 29.62% of the forest cover. Higher annual net deforestation rates were observed in the period from 1930–1975 (0.68%) followed by 1975–1985 (0.23%), 1985–1995 (0.12%), 1995–2005 (0.06%) and 2005–2014 (0.04%) for the region. Forest fragmentation had significant spatio-temporal variation across the South Asian countries. In 1930, 88.91% of the South Asian forest was classified as large core forest, 8.18% as edge forest and 1.18% as perforated forest. The large core forest category has decreased significantly in area over last eight decades. The results of the present study are expected to serve as a reference for the evaluation of globally agreed Aichi biodiversity target 5 for South Asian countries. This study will be a valuable basis for developing management strategies and restoration programs as it tracks the spatial changes in deforestation and forest fragmentation.\"], ['The article describes the land use system transition dynamics in selected states in India and discusses its underlying biodiversity impacts and economic driving forces. The concept of system transition is described as a continuum between forests and highly intensive agriculture via different grades of intensification where profit differential is identified as the system transition pressure. In order to operationalise the concept, the article develops land use suitability, input use intensity and farming system diversity indices which are calculated for different agricultural cropping systems in the selected states of India. The results show the apparent decline in land use suitability, reduction in farming system diversity, increase of cultivation intensity, reflecting a reduction in planned and associated agro-biodiversity. The results also show increasing transition pressure to shift from low intensive and high diverse systems to high intensive low diverse systems that represent increasing opportunity cost of conservation of the former systems. A set of policy measures to deflate the transition pressure that can at least retain a threshold of traditional high diversity systems are briefly discussed.

We assessed the effects of planting the high-value spice crop cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum) on forest structure, tree species composition, and soil properties in the montane forests of the Knuckles Forest Reserve in central Sri Lanka, where cardamom cultivation has been banned since 1985 because of the high conservation value of this site. Vegetation and soil were sampled in forest under-planted with cardamom and adjacent natural forests without planted cardamom. The densities of woody plants (⩾5\\xa0cm\\xa0dbh), saplings (<5\\xa0cm\\xa0dbh and ⩾1.5\\xa0m tall), and seedlings (<1.5\\xa0m tall) were lower in cardamom plantations than natural forests, while stand basal area was marginally higher in cardamom plantations. Canopy openness at 1.3\\xa0m height was higher in the cardamom plantations (mean\\xa0±\\xa0SEM: 35\\xa0±\\xa08%) than in the natural forests (19\\xa0±\\xa03%). Pioneer tree species such as Macaranga sp. increased in abundance in cardamom plantations, and this contributed to the emergence of a difference in species composition between cardamom plantations and adjacent natural forests. Species richness of trees ⩾5\\xa0cm\\xa0dbh per plot was higher in natural forests than cardamom plantations, while species diversity was higher in cardamom plantations. The concentration of total N in top-soil was higher in natural forests, while concentrations of total P and exchangeable K were higher in the cardamom plantations. We conclude that cardamom cultivation results in a net loss of tree stems through weeding and opening of the canopy to promote cardamom production. The higher concentrations of total P and exchangeable K in the soil of cardamom plantations may be associated with the application of fertilizer, while total N concentration may have been higher in the natural forests because residual uncultivated forest occurs at a slightly higher elevation than the majority of cardamom plantations and/or because of elevated denitrification rates in the cardamom plantation. Since cardamom cultivation has affected forest structure and soil properties, management interventions may be required to mitigate these effects in high conservation value forests where cardamom cultivation has been banned.'], ['The occurrence and abundance of five species of arboreal mammals in 25 rain forest fragments ranging from <1 ha to 2500 ha in area in the Anamalai Hills in south India, were examined in relation to several habitat and landscape variables. The lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus) was the most affected, being absent from 15 fragments while the Nilgiri langur (Trachypithecus johnii) was absent from six and the Malabar giant squirrel (Ratufa indica) from only three fragments. The densities of the giant squirrel, the large brown flying squirrel (Petaurista petaurista) and the Travancore flying squirrel (Petinomys fuscocapillus) increased with decreasing area and increasing disturbance level. In logistic regression, canopy height and tree density were the best predictors of the occurrence of the lion-tailed macaque and the Nilgiri langur, respectively. Area of the fragment may be an important predictor of occurrence of these species only when the fragments are very small. Once initially present, their continued occurrence is better predicted by habitat variation, consistent with the ecology of the species. It is possible to retain the arboreal mammals in the rain forest fragments through improving habitat quality. The suggested measures include (a) prevention of degradation due to lopping and felling of trees; (b) assisted regeneration in forest fragments; and (c) retention of orchards of jack fruit trees (Artocarpus integrifolia), guava (Psidium guajava), etc., in the labour settlements around the fragments.

None of three other biodiversity hotspots in the Oriental mainland were found to harbour an equivalent level of long-term evolutionary history in this frog group.

MODIS-VCF raw product of 2005 was validated using the field data and showed a coefficient of determination (R2\\xa0=\\xa00.85) between percent tree cover and individual plot wise canopy cover information. The results were overlaid with UNEP protected area boundary. On a long-term basis, the forest cover change was monitored using medium spatial resolution (Landsat and IRS) satellite data to identify the rate of deforestation and fragmentation at landscape level.

The sites were selected to represent four disturbance categories: relatively undisturbed, moderately disturbed, much disturbed and heavily disturbed. All lianas ≥1\\xa0cm dbh were counted, which resulted in a total amount of 5689 individuals of lianas, representing 77 species in 62 genera and 32 families. Liana species richness and abundance increased with forest disturbance, but the liana basal area values showed an opposite trend, with high scores in undisturbed sites. Twining was the main climbing mechanism (61.3%) and zoochory (59.6%) was the main dispersal mode in all the four forest categories. Application of Bray–Curtis cluster analysis produced three distinct clusters in which the much disturbed category was more distant from the others. High abundance of large lianas in undisturbed sites and that of the invasive Lantana camara in heavily disturbed site signals the conservation significance of the less disturbed study sites. The predominance of zoochorous dispersal indicates the faunal dependence of lianas, besides of host trees, thus underlining the need for a holistic approach in biodiversity conservation of this and similar tropical forests.'], ['This study was undertaken to investigate the use of satellite remote sensing data in forest-type mapping and change detection in a part of the Western Ghats in Karnataka, India. Using Landsat MSS data, it could be possible to map various types of forests viz., evergreen, semi-evergreen, moist deciduous, dry deciduous, degraded and scrub, and to detect changes in their spatial distribution over a period of time. A reduction of 5.66% in total forest area was noted from 1973 to 1985. The decrease was pronounced in the case of semi-evergreen and moist deciduous forests. This study also demonstrated (a) that temporal, low-resolution satellite data could be conveniently used in forest-type mapping and temporal monitoring on an operational level and (b) that such a survey is time- and cost-effective.'], ['The tree rhododendrons include the most widely distributed Himalayan Rhododendron species belonging to the subsection Arborea. Distributions of two members of this sub-species were modelled using bioclimatic data for current conditions (1950–2000). A subset of the least correlated bioclimatic variables was used for ecological niche modelling (ENM). We used an ENM ensemble method in the BiodiversityR R-package to map the suitable climatic space for tree rhododendrons based on 217 point location records. Ensemble bioclimatic models for tree rhododendrons had high predictive power with bioclimatic variables, which also separated the climatic spaces for the two species. Tree rhododendrons were found occurring in a wide range of climate and the distributional limits were associated with isothermality, temperature ranges, temperature of the wettest quarter, and precipitation of the warmest quarter of the year. The most suitable climatic space for tree rhododendrons was predicted to be in western Yunnan, China, with suitability declining towards the west and east. Its occurrence in a wide range of climatic settings with highly dissected habitats speaks to the adaptive capacity of the species, which might open up future options for their conservation planning in regions where they are listed as threatened.'], [\"This study examines the influence of an extra-curricular educational program on children's knowledge and cultural valuation of wild food plants, which are an important component of their diets. This program aims to reinforce children's traditional knowledge and values around biological resources in Wayanad, India's Western Ghats, encouraging tribal and non-tribal children to learn from each other and from their own communities. Results show that the educational program has enhanced children's ability to identify selected wild food plants. Moreover, strong social stigma related to wild food plant gathering also appears to have been effectively countered, and the program seems to have created more self-confidence among the children about (a) the perceptions of others' social attitudes towards their gathering practices, and (b) the importance of these plants as part of their diets and cultures.\"], ['This study estimates the value of forest ecosystem services provided by a protected area in a biodiversity hotspot in India. It also addresses some of the shortcomings identified in existing literature by estimating the value of several intangible benefits, and disservices of forests ignored in most valuation studies, as well as the added value from intact forests as compared to from alternative landscapes. Using primary and secondary data, and economic valuation techniques the study shows that the total net benefits provided by the Nagarhole national park in Karnataka, India are considerable. The added value of benefits from the park is also higher as compared to from alternative landscapes considering just three ecosystem services. If these are factored in decision making it could strengthen the economic case for conserving forests in tropical countries such as India where there is immense pressure to divert forests for meeting development needs.'], ['Information is given on the population status, distribution and ecology of the Ganges river dolphin, Platanista gangetica, in the Karnali River, Nepal. Seven animals were counted. Sightings were highly habitat-specific. Six habitats were identified and classified as primary or marginal, according to differences in physical characteristics and sighting frequencies within them (χ2, p < 0·05, d.f. = 5). Mean sighting frequencies were 0·57 and 0·13 sightings/visit for primary and marginal habitats, respectively. Primary habitats were characterized by an eddy counter-current system in the main river flow caused by a fine sand/silt point bar formed from sediment deposits of a convergent stream branch or tributary. Marginal habitats were characterized by a smaller eddy counter-current system caused by an upstream meander. Mean group size was 1·38 animals. Dolphin movements within primary habitats were found to be nonrandom and aggregate for 25 theodolite tracking sessions (χ2, p < 0·05, d.f. = 1–7), concentrated in locations of high prey availability and reduced flow.

The map was created using an on-screen visual interpretation technique and has an accuracy of 90%, as assessed using 15,565 ground control points. India has hitherto been using potential vegetation/forest type map prepared by Champion and Seth in 1968. We characterized and mapped further the vegetation type distribution in the country in terms of occurrence and distribution, area occupancy, percentage of protected area (PA) covered by each vegetation type, range of elevation, mean annual temperature and precipitation over the past 100 years. A remote sensing-amenable hierarchical classification scheme that accommodates natural and semi-natural systems was conceptualized, and the natural vegetation was classified into forests, scrub/shrub lands and grasslands on the basis of extent of vegetation cover. We discuss the distribution and potential utility of the vegetation type map in a broad range of ecological, climatic and conservation applications from global, national and local perspectives. We used 15,565 ground control points to assess the accuracy of products available globally (i.e., GlobCover, Holdridge’s life zone map and potential natural vegetation (PNV) maps). Hence we recommend that the map prepared herein be used widely. This vegetation type map is the most comprehensive one developed for India so far. It was prepared using 23.5\\xa0m seasonal satellite remote sensing data, field samples and information relating to the biogeography, climate and soil.

Hilsa is the national fish of Bangladesh and it contributes 10% of the total fish production of the country, with a market value of $1.74 billion. Hilsa also holds a very important place in the economics of West Bengal of India with 12.5% of the catch and also tops the marine capture in Myanmar. During the last two decades Hilsa production from inland waters has been stable, whereas marine yields in the BoB increased substantially. In order to sustainably manage the trans-boundary stock of Hilsa, the taxonomy, distribution, habitat, migration patterns, population dynamics, fisheries and socio-economics aspects of the fishery have been reviewed here. To achieve a successful trans-boundary management for the Hilsa stock, complete ban on undersize fishing, well-targeted temporal and spatial bans, creation of protected areas in strategic points, incentive for Hilsa fishers and ecological restoration of Hilsa habitats and more work on technological development of Hilsa aquaculture are recommended.'], ['Millions of people are dependent on tropical forests for livelihood. However, their dependence on meagre incomes from nontimber forest products (NTFPs) and payment for ecosystem services (PES) are leading to continuing poverty. It is doubtful if the program, Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has yet achieved much in its primary goal of forest conservation, and the chance of it helping to alleviate rural poverty is slim. Forest conservation per se hardly creates economic opportunities, beyond survival, for rural people. Our efforts for conserving forests and their biodiversity will remain less effective as long as there are so many enclaves of trenchant poverty within and around them in the landscapes and we continue to by-pass practical routes to poverty alleviation. Poverty can be alleviated only if local actions spur economic development in which local communities have a rightful and fair share and can earn rewards for their entrepreneurships.Wood is a renewable, recyclable, versatile and sustainable natural resource. The demands for wood products are rising in developing countries, as their economies grow. They also face endemic wood deficits. This provides opportunities to pro-actively develop commercial forestry as a path to rural development and poverty alleviation. That would also assist national climate change mitigation measures, because forests sequester carbon, wood products are largely carbon positive and timber- based options are on hand to substitute for high emission materials such as concrete, steel and aluminium used to build our living environments.To move along this path, the businesses of tree growing by small-growers and local value adding should be strengthened, catalysing the entrepreneurial spirits of local people. Central to this is the need to put in place strategies to improve the productivity of and value from small scale enterprises; yet there is a serious lack of research and application to serve this key need. Among other constraints faced by small-growers include, lack of transparent and legal rights to land ownership in several countries, layers of bureaucratic regulations and the current international forest certification systems which are cumbersome and unaffordable for small-growers. Actions are possible and needed for simplifying or removing road blocks on all these fronts, along with, importantly, the development of markets for diverse products. Growth of the forestry sector as an engine for rural development warrants far greater recognition and investment than has been the case so far. We need to re-imagine and strengthen the role of forestry including commercial wood business - green growth - as an effective path to rural development and poverty alleviation.'], ['Swertia chirata (Family: Gentianaceae) is a potent and valuable medicinal herb used in various herbal formulations in Indian system of medicine. Different species of Swertia are being used as constituents in various herbal formulations. Present study was undertaken for the screening of an efficient extraction technique and for the development of a rapid and simultaneous quantification of four pentacyclic triterpenoids in different populations of Swertia species by a high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC)-densitometric method. This method involved the separation of four triterpenoids with a single mobile phase composition consisting of n-hexane, ethyl acetate, toluene (14.2, 4, 1.8 v/v). The retention factor (Rf) values for oleanolic acid (OA), ursolic acid (UA), betulinic acid (BA), and lupeol (Lup) were 0.25, 0.50, 0.58 and 0.74 respectively. In this study, microwave assisted extraction (MAE) using aqueous ethanol proved to be the most efficient method for extraction for all the studied triterpenoids when compared with the other conventional methods. The present HPTLC method was found to be precise, fast, and cost effective and can be used for the quality control of any Swertia samples with regards to its pentacyclic triterpenoids content.

In the present paper estimation of genetic variability within and among 41 accessions representing five populations was carried out using 3 single primer amplification reaction (SPAR) methods viz. RAPD, DAMD and ISSR. The cumulative data analysis was carried out for all three SPAR methods, and showed 82.32% polymorphism across all the accessions of S. emarginatus. Jaccard's similarity values among 41 accessions ranged from 0.15 to 0.49 with an average value of 0.37. The intra-population genetic diversity revealed highest values of Nei's genetic diversity (0.19,) Shannon information index (0.29) and polymorphic loci (55.18%), among the accessions of Gujarat (GJ) population, while the corresponding lowest values were (0.10), (0.15) and (26.40%) respectively among the accessions of Rajasthan (RJ) population. The maximum inter-population average genetic distance (0.20) was between Karnataka (KA) and RJ, while the corresponding least genetic distance (0.06) was between Allahabad (AL) and Varanasi (VS) populations. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed maximum percentage of variation among individuals of populations (72%) followed by 16% among regions and 12% among populations. Principal coordinate analysis (PCA) of cumulative data also supported the clustering pattern in the UPGMA dendrogram. These results suggest that genetic diversity is corroborating with the geographical diversity. Mantel's test was performed which revealed a highly significant correlation between cumulative vs RAPD, and showed the maximum (0.93) correlation coefficient, followed by cumulative vs ISSR (0.78) and cumulative vs DAMD (0.91) respectively, and this clearly indicates that the SPAR methods (RAPD, DAMD and ISSR) are sufficiently informative and are suitable to analyze the genetic variability within and among the populations of S. emarginatus.\"], ['Under a centralized forest management system dating back to the start of the British colonial regime, forest-dwelling communities across India were denied formal rights to access forest resources, while large tracts of forest land were degraded or deforested. Enacted in 2006, The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, better known as the Forest Rights Act, was a landmark piece of legislation in India. Its attempt at righting a “historic injustice” and “strengthening the conservation regime” through recognition of forest dwellers’ right to sustainably use and manage forests is significant for socioeconomic, political and ecological reasons. Beyond implications for people and forests of India, the Forest Rights Act represents an important case study that informs analysis of a global trend toward decentralization of governance of forests as well as rights-based approaches to development. This study analyses implementation of the Forest Rights Act across India for the period 2008-2017. We examine rates of formal distribution of rights claims at the level of individual states, and we try to explain variance across states through reliance on political, economic and ecological considerations. In trying to make sense of the large variation in the outcomes of claims made under the Forest Rights Act across states, we find that extent of forest cover is positively associated with rate of distribution of claims, and presence of left-wing extremism is positively associated with claim rejection rates. These findings indicate constraints to wider and more even formal implementation of this legal foundation for development, and they highlight important governance tensions underlying prospects for environmental conservation through decentralization of forest management authority.'], ['The aim of the present study was to screen cardioactive herbs from Western Ghats of India. The heart beat rate (HBR) and blood flow during systole and diastole were tested in zebrafish embryos. We found that Cynodon dactylon (C. dactylon) induced increases in the HBR in zebrafish embryos with a HBR of (3.968±0.344) beats/s, which was significantly higher than that caused by betamethosone [(3.770±0.344) beats/s]. The EC50 value of C. dactylon was 3.738 μg/mL. The methanolic extract of Sida acuta (S. acuta) led to decreases in the HBR in zebrafish embryos [(1.877±0.079) beats/s], which was greater than that caused by nebivolol (positive control). The EC50 value of Sida acuta was 1.195 μg/mL. The untreated embryos had a HBR of (2.685±0.160) beats/s at 3 d post fertilization (dpf).

Ollur Kavu, S.N. Puram Kavu and Iringole Kavu which represent above mentioned management systems, respectively, were studied for their tree species composition and vegetation structure. The study was also designed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of present management systems and role of different stakeholder groups in conserving the sacred groves. Of the three sacred groves, the one managed by individual family (Ollur Kavu) is highly disturbed as indicated by low stem density of mature trees (367\\xa0ha−1) and poor regeneration potential with the ratio between mature trees and saplings is 1:0.4. In order to quantify the level of disturbance in these sacred groves, Ramakrishnan index of stand quality (RISQ) was calculated. The values obtained for all the three tree layers (i.e., mature trees, saplings and seedlings) in single family managed sacred grove (Ollur Kavu) was between 2.265 and 2.731, an indicator of the dominance of light demanding species in the population, suggested that the grove is highly disturbed one. Whereas, other two sacred groves are less disturbed as indicated by lower `RISQ' values (between 1.319 and 1.648). Iringole Kavu and S.N. Puram Kavu were compared with some other evergreen forests of the Western Ghats of India for the parameters like stem density, basal area and species diversity of trees (gbh≥10.1\\xa0cm). Values obtained for these parameters in the two sacred groves are within the range obtained for other forests. Stakeholder importance value index (SIVI) was calculated based on the attributes like the proximity of the stakeholder to the sacred grove, contribution of stakeholders in managing the sacred grove, benefits being enjoyed by the stakeholder due to involvement with sacred grove and attitude of the stakeholder group towards the conservation and management of sacred grove. This indicated that local people, temple trust and/ or sacred grove owners are the major stakeholders, while in general some other stakeholder groups such as youth clubs, schools, forest department, municipality and local Panchayat with lower SIVI are comparatively neutral in conserving and managing the groves. Some of the major strategies to be adopted are self-imposed complete ban on the removal of biomass for the revitalisation of ecosystem, creation of awareness among local people and all stakeholder groups, identification of the type of contribution a stakeholder group can offer in managing the sacred grove and encouragement of all stakeholders to participate without either directly or indirectly adversely affecting the ecosystem as well as the wisdom and interest of the major stakeholder groups.\"], ['While there is no substitute for undisturbed forest, secondary forests and agroforests are increasingly common in tropical areas and may be critical to conservation plans. We compared the diversity and abundance of birds and the characteristics of mixed-species bird flocks in forests inside protected reserves to “buffer” areas, consisting of degraded forests and non-native timber plantations at reserve boundaries, and to agricultural areas. We monitored a network of 57 transects placed over an altitudinal gradient (90–2180\\xa0masl) in Sri Lanka and southern India, collecting 398 complete flock observations and 35,686 observations of birds inside and outside of flocks over two\\xa0years. Flocks were rarely found in agricultural areas. However, the density of flocks in buffer areas was similar to that in forests, although buffer flocks were smaller in average flock size and differed significantly in composition, as measured by the proportion of species that were classified, from the literature, as forest interior or open-landscape species. While flock composition was distinct between agricultural, buffer and forest areas, the differences in the composition of flocks was not as great as the differences between the overall communities in these different habitats. Considering buffer transects alone, pine plantations retained fewer forest interior species in flocks than did forests, and small areas of agriculture and abandoned agriculture attracted open-landscape species. Though clearly not equivalent to protected forests, degraded forests and agroforests in buffer areas still hold some conservation value, with forest species found particularly in mixed-species flocks in these human-modified habitats.'], ['Genus Nemacheilus, Nemachilichthys and Schistura belong to the family Nemacheilidae of the order Cypriniformes.

This herb was studied using arbitrary amplified (RAPD and ISSR) and gene targeted (SCoT and CBDP) molecular markers. Thirty-nine accessions were collected from five agro-ecological regions of India. Eighteen RAPD and five ISSR primers generated a total of 124 and 32 amplicons with an average of 6.89 and 6.4 amplicons per primer respectively. Similarly, 22 SCoT and 19CBDP primers were used to characterize A. paniculata accessions. A total of 132 and 97 amplicons were generated, with an average of 6.0 and 5.11 amplicons per primer, respectively.

Population structure based analysis divided 39 accessions into seven populations, six populations and four populations using RAPD, ISSR and SCoT markers respectively. Whereas only three populations were observed using CBDP primers which corresponded to the grouping observed with the UPGMA. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) based analysis showed that the maximum variation (10%) among agro-ecological regions was observed using CBDP primers; whereas, minimum variation (2%) was observed using SCoT markers.

Disentangling the influence of these two processes on species persistence is an important step towards reconciling conservation and agriculture production. We investigated how forest cover and management intensification affect the conservation value of cacao agroforests for mammals in an Atlantic forest landscape in southern Bahia, the most extensive area of diverse shaded cacao plantations in Brazil. Although both factors affected the distribution of mammal species, management intensification had a stronger effect, negatively affecting a larger number of species. Frequency of domestic dogs, an indirect aspect of management intensification, negatively affected four species and lower connectivity of shading trees decreased the use of cacao agroforests by three species of conservation concern. In comparison, the reduced forest cover negatively affected two species of conservation concern. Our results suggest that controlling domestic dog populations is particularly valuable for large mammal conservation in agroforestry mosaics, since it does not affect crop productivity. Improving shade cover within agroforests, on the other hand, should be implemented carefully, maintaining acceptable yield while promoting canopy connectivity and the recruitment of tree species used by forest dependent mammals. However, the importance of both local management intensification and local forest cover are likely to be context dependent, and changes in their relative importance are likely to occur with different levels of deforestation at the landscape scale.'], ['Among the most popular of metrics used to quantify landscape composition are Shannon’s index, believed to emphasize the richness component of diversity, and Simpson’s index, emphasizing the evenness component. These indices can show considerable variation in response to changes in landscape richness and evenness. However, the possibility of encountering opposite trends in the responses of these indices to assemblages that differ in only a single component of diversity has not been sufficiently acknowledged. An opposite response of these indices was observed for two Indian landscapes with the same richness, differing only in evenness. Using a numerical simulation, the likelihood of encountering landscapes with an opposite response was demonstrated to increase with increasing richness, from about 4% for landscapes consisting of three cover types, to about 6% for ten types. This emphasizes the need for caution when choosing an index of landscape diversity. Rare cover types provide habitats for sensitive species and facilitate critical ecological processes. The Shannon index, sensitive to their presence, is therefore recommended for landscape management within an ecological framework. Simpson’s index, more responsive to the dominant cover type, can be used for specific situations where the dominant cover type is of interest, such as single-species reserve design.'], ['Watershed management is the process of formulating and carrying out a course of action involving manipulation of natural system of a watershed to achieve specified objectives.

Only a fraction of the planet's species has been described by science (the “Linnean shortfall”). Even for described species, scientists often have only fragmentary information about their distributions (the “Wallacean” shortfall). These shortfalls in biodiversity knowledge place serious limitations on the ability to conserve biodiversity in the face of the ongoing extinction crisis. Here, I test the hypothesis that data deficiency may be used to guide surveys and inventories to regions that would increase the probability of discovering new species. I compiled global distribution maps for all Data Deficient amphibian species (species described up to 2004) and constructed a Data Deficiency (DD) surface (the DD surface was based on distribution information obtained from the IUCN Red List). Then, I compared the type-locality sites of new amphibian species descriptions (species described between 2005 and 2009) with the DD surface in order to check if new species discoveries were significantly more abundant within the DD surface or not. Even though the amphibian DD species surface covers only 8% of Earth's land area, 79% of the amphibian species discovered between 2005 and 2009 were within the DD surface. The results suggest that directing surveys towards areas of known data deficiency will likely result in the discovery of species new to science, helping to address the Linnean shortfall. Incorporating DD information from the IUCN Red List may provide an efficient methodology for strategically targeting surveys and inventories, maximizing the chances of obtaining high conservation benefits from them, and helping minimize the costs associated with such endeavours.\"], [' of deforestation continue to rise in many parts of the tropics, the international conservation community is faced with the challenge of finding approaches which can reduce deforestation and provide rural livelihoods in addition to conserving biodiversity. Much of modern-day conservation is motivated by a desire to conserve ‘pristine nature’ in protected areas, while there is growing recognition of the long-term human involvement in forest dynamics and of the importance of conservation outside protected areas. Agroforestry – intentional management of shade trees with agricultural crops – has the potential for providing habitats outside formally protected land, connecting nature reserves and alleviating resource-use pressure on conservation areas. Here we examine the role of agroforestry systems in maintaining species diversity and conclude that these systems can play an important role in biodiversity conservation in human-dominated landscapes.'], ['The impact of biotic pressures on the habitat and population of the endangered grizzled giant squirrel Ratufa macroura dandolena was quantified from December 1987 to January 1989 during a three-year study in Alagarkoil Valley (15 km2) in the Srivilliputtur Grizzled Giant Squirrel Wildlife Sanctuary in south India. This valley has about 40% of the total population of c. 300 of this subspecies in south India. A total of 40,079 people visited the 11 km2 study area during the study period. This included pilgrims (57%), wood cutters (40%) and collectors of minor forest produce such as Combretum ovalifolium climbers and Tamarindus indica fruits.The squirrel population did not show a decline during annual counts over three years but these disturbances resulted in loss of cover, food trees and nesting sites. Conservation measures are needed to safeguard this population and its habitat by the creation of a 40 km2 Alagarkoil Valley National Park and planting of desired species to promote canopy continuity and availability of food plants, nesting sites and cover.'], ['Sweet flag (Acorus calamus L.), is a critically endangered species of mountainous regions of India. In order to evaluate and preserve the endangered medicinally important plant Sweet flag. We investigated the variation by collecting the whole plant from different geographical regions. Genetic variability among 20 accessions of this species was assessed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) (25 primers) and inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers (17 primers).The results showed 33.7% of bands formed by RAPD markers and 63.7% for ISSR were polymorphic. The Shannon’s indices (I) and Nei’s genetic diversity (h) among all the accessions were estimated for RAPD and ISSR respectively at 0.58 (SD\\xa0=\\xa00.07), 0.57 (SD\\xa0=\\xa00.13) and 0.40 (SD\\xa0=\\xa00.06), 0.33 (SD\\xa0=\\xa00.11) respectively. The similarity coefficient ranged from 0.72 to 0.94. The results revealed that genetic variation is much low among accessions. Since genetic variation within collected accessions is homogenous, the pattern of low genetic diversity within the accessions specifies that they are monoclonal. Therefore, we proposed that studies of intraspecific variation could be utilized in the development of conservation strategies, by identifying appropriate units of A. calamus for conservation.'], ['Commonly proposed definitions of the \"anthropocene\" suggest that significant human alteration of the Earth system is connected to fossil fuel consumption coinciding with the Industrial Revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries, or global change resulting from the \"Great Acceleration\" following the Second World War. Although evidence for earlier, anthropogenically-driven environmental changes are acknowledged, they are seen as qualitatively different. This perspective is also prevalent in conservation and ecological discussions of human impacts on tropical forests. A growing body of archaeological and historical evidence demonstrates, however, that humans influenced physical, chemical, and biological systems through large regions of tropical forest starting as early as 45,000 years ago. This evidence challenges the idea, prevalent in global scenarios of anthropogenic land cover change, that human influence on tropical forests was limited until the colonial or industrial era. This paper reviews the role of tropical forests in the Earth system and, through a synthesis of archaeological data, critiques the prevailing view of anthropogenic influence on tropical forests in the pre-industrial world. We suggest that any definition of the anthropocene should account for the long history of human modifications to tropical forests. Archaeological and palaeoenvironmental research in these ecosystems is also critical to the broader debates in the social and natural sciences around the onset and utility of the anthropocene concept, and the potential for long-term, sustainable occupation of tropical forest environments.'], ['Coffee-farming units of India, with their strong orientation to export markets, have in the WTO era, displayed a high propensity for compliance with trade-facilitating environmental norms arising from sanitary and phytosanitary measures. But thee farming units seek to recoup incremental costs arising from compliance with these norms through unsustainable exploitation of their biodiversity wealth. Based on this unique case of conflict between WTO-related environmental standards and biodiversity concerns, the paper advocates integration of national and global environmental concerns with trade-related environmental regulations in the larger interests of sustainable agriculture in developing countries.'], ['Orchids (Orchidaceae) are one of the most diverse plant groups on the planet with over 25,000 species. For over a century, scientists and horticulturalists have been fascinated by their complex floral morphology, pollinator specificity and multiple ethnobotanical uses, including as food, flavourings, medicines, ornaments, and perfumes. These important traits have stimulated world-wide collection of orchid species, often for the commercial production of hybrids and leading to frequent overexploitation. Increasing human activities and global environmental changes are also accelerating the threat of orchid extinction in their natural habitats. In order to improve gene conservation strategies for these unique species, innovative developments of cryopreservation methodologies are urgently needed based on an appreciation of low temperature (cryo) stress tolerance, the stimulation of recovery growth of plant tissues in vitro and on the ‘omics’ characterization of the targeted cell system (biotechnology). The successful development and application of such cryobiotechnology now extends to nearly 100 species and commercial hybrids of orchids, underpinning future breeding and species conservation programmes. In this contribution, we provide an overview of the progress in cryobanking of a range of orchid tissues, including seeds, pollen, protocorms, protocorm-like bodies, apices excised from in vitro plants, cell suspensions, rhizomes and orchid fungal symbionts. We also highlight future research needs.'], ['Seed dispersal is a key process in plant communities and frugivory is very important in vertebrate communities. This paper updates a review of frugivory and seed dispersal by vertebrates in the Oriental Region (tropical and subtropical Asia) published in 1998. The major conclusions remain the same. Small fruits are consumed by a wide range of potential seed dispersal agents, including species that thrive in small forest fragments and degraded landscapes. Larger and larger-seeded fruits are consumed by progressively fewer dispersers, and the largest depend on a few species of mammals and birds which are highly vulnerable to hunting, fragmentation, and habitat loss. Controlling hunting in both forest areas and the agricultural matrix must be a top priority for conservation. A lot more natural history information has been added to the literature since 1998. This reinforces previous evidence for the importance of hornbills, bulbuls, elephants, gibbons, civets, and fruit bats in seed dispersal, and suggests that the roles of green pigeons, macaques, rodents, bears, and deer were previously underestimated. The taxa for which additional natural history observations would be most valuable include fish, pheasants, pigeons, babblers, rodents, and even-toed ungulates. For other animal taxa, future frugivory and seed dispersal studies need to focus more on the fitness consequences for both the plants and the animals.'], ['Protected areas are experiencing increased levels of human pressure. To enable appropriate conservation action, it is critical to map and monitor changes in the type and extent of land cover/use and habitat classes, which can be related to human pressures over time. Satellite Earth observation (EO) data and techniques offer the opportunity to detect such changes. Yet association with field information and expert interpretation by ecologists is required to interpret, qualify and link these changes to human pressure. There is thus an urgent need to harmonize the technical background of experts in the field of EO data analysis with the terminology of ecologists, protected area management authorities and policy makers in order to provide meaningful, context-specific value-added EO products. This paper builds on the DPSIR framework, providing a terminology to relate the concepts of state, pressures, and drivers with the application of EO analysis. The type of pressure can be inferred through the detection of changes in state (i.e. changes in land cover and/or habitat type and/or condition). Four broad categories of changes in state are identified, i.e. land cover/habitat conversion, land cover/habitat modification, habitat fragmentation and changes in landscape connectivity, and changes in plant community structure. These categories of change in state can be mapped through EO analyses, with the goal of using expert judgement to relate changes in state to causal direct anthropogenic pressures. Drawing on expert knowledge, a set of protected areas located in diverse socio-ecological contexts and subject to a variety of pressures are analysed to (a) link the four categories of changes in state of land cover/habitats to the drivers (anthropogenic pressure), as relevant to specific target land cover and habitat classes; (b) identify (for pressure mapping) the most appropriate spatial and temporal EO data sources as well as interpretations from ecologists and field data useful in connection with EO data analysis. We provide detailed examples for two protected areas, demonstrating the use of EO data for detection of land cover/habitat change, coupled with expert interpretation to relate such change to specific anthropogenic pressures. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations and feasibility of using EO data and techniques to identify anthropogenic pressures, suggesting additional research efforts required in this direction.'], ['To examine management options for biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, eight research regions were classified into social-ecological domains, using a dataset of indicators of livelihood resources, i.e., capital assets. Potential interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture were then compared among landscapes and domains. The approach combined literature review with expert judgment by researchers working in each landscape. Each landscape was described for land use, rural livelihoods and attitudes of social actors toward biodiversity and intensification of agriculture. Principal components analysis of 40 indicators of natural, human, social, financial and physical capital for the eight landscapes showed a loss of biodiversity associated with high-input agricultural intensification. High levels of natural capital (e.g. indicators of wildland biodiversity conservation and agrobiodiversity for human needs) were positively associated with indicators of human capital, including knowledge of the flora and fauna and knowledge sharing among farmers. Three social-ecological domains were identified across the eight landscapes (Tropical Agriculture-Forest Matrix, Tropical Degrading Agroecosystem, and Temperate High-Input Commodity Agriculture) using hierarchical clustering of the indicator values. Each domain shared a set of interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture and ecological intensification that could also increase food security in the impoverished landscapes. Implementation of interventions differed greatly among the landscapes, e.g. financial capital for new farming practices in the Intensive Agriculture domain vs. developing market value chains in the other domains. This exploratory study suggests that indicators of knowledge systems should receive greater emphasis in the monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and that inventories of assets at the landscape level can inform adaptive management of agrobiodiversity-based interventions.'], ['Urban planning is a tool, which enables in managing changes within a spatial approach. It helps in conducting planning activities where the economic, environmental, and social goals are taken care of holistically. Planning process involves studying past trends, learning from past and present, and then preparing a proposal for future. This process mostly assesses the trend of growth and plans for development. A trend follows change in a defined rate. An indefinite or unexpected change spoils the planning process, by breaking the trend of growth. City is known for its resources, geography, population, social-culture structure, economy etc. Whenever there is an unexpected change in any of these parameters, the city undergoes remarkable changes. Disaster also brings hasty changes in all these, which is indeed a challenge to urban planning and design. The fast modernization and adoption of western culture leads to significant changes in socio-cultural and economic spheres. City also changes, when rapid movement of people and resources occur. Tourism industry in this decade brought many changes is Indian cities. It diversifies social and cultural identity of the city and generates tremendous opportunity for economic development. Therefore cities having tourism potential are facing urban planning problems. Exploring these issues and reasons behind it will be helpful to minimize its impact. Tourism cities have tremendous potential of research in this direction. The need of the decade for urban planners and designers is to be prepared for the changes in a tourist city.'], ['The status and trends of global biodiversity are often measured with a bias towards datasets limited to terrestrial vertebrates. The first global assessment of an insect order (Odonata) provides new context to the ongoing discussion of current biodiversity loss. A randomly selected sample of 1500 (26.4%) of the 5680 described dragonflies and damselflies was assessed using IUCN’s Red List criteria. Distribution maps for each species were created and species were assigned to habitat types. These data were analysed in respect to threat level for regions and habitat types. We have found that one in 10 species of dragonflies and damselflies is threatened with extinction. This threat level is among the lowest of groups that have been assessed to date, suggesting that previous estimates of extinction risk for insects might be misleading. However, Odonata only comprise a small invertebrate order, with above-average dispersal ability and relatively wide distribution ranges. For conservation science and policy to be truly representative of global biodiversity a representative cross-section of invertebrates needs to be included.'], ['Attappady is a rural area in Kerala, South India, that has suffered from severe land degradation and which is inhabited by a poor and predominantly tribal population. The combination of severe land degradation, poverty and a tribal population make Attappady hydrologically and socially unique. Ecological degradation and deforestation followed the gradual building up of land pressure resulting from immigration by more wealthy outsiders. The hills of Attappady were once the forest land of Kerala. Recently it was on the verge of complete degradation.This paper explains how an ecorestoration project involving soil and water conservation interventions, the introduction of agro-forestry, nutritional diversification, income generation activities and training was implemented in a participatory manner. The project had positive impacts on both the environment and the livelihoods of the people living in the watershed, but it also suffered from drawbacks. This paper reports on the successes as well as the lessons learned from this unique ecorestoration project.'], [\"Mangrove forests in South Asia occur along the tidal sea edge of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. These forests provide important ecosystem goods and services to the region's dense coastal populations and support important functions of the biosphere. Mangroves are under threat from both natural and anthropogenic stressors; however the current status and dynamics of the region's mangroves are poorly understood. We mapped the current extent of mangrove forests in South Asia and identified mangrove forest cover change (gain and loss) from 2000 to 2012 using Landsat satellite data. We also conducted three case studies in Indus Delta (Pakistan), Goa (India), and Sundarbans (Bangladesh and India) to identify rates, patterns, and causes of change in greater spatial and thematic details compared to regional assessment of mangrove forests.Our findings revealed that the areal extent of mangrove forests in South Asia is approximately 1,187,476\\xa0ha representing ∼7% of the global total. Our results showed that from 2000 to 2012, 92,135\\xa0ha of mangroves were deforested and 80,461\\xa0ha were reforested with a net loss of 11,673\\xa0ha. In all three case studies, mangrove areas have remained the same or increased slightly, however, the turnover was greater than the net change. Both, natural and anthropogenic factors are responsible for the change and turnover. The major causes of forest cover change are similar throughout the region; however, specific factors may be dominant in specific areas. Major causes of deforestation in South Asia include (i) conversion to other land use (e.g. conversion to agriculture, shrimp farms, development, and human settlement), (ii) over-harvesting (e.g. grazing, browsing and lopping, and fishing), (iii) pollution, (iv) decline in freshwater availability, (v) floodings, (vi) reduction of silt deposition, (vii) coastal erosion, and (viii) disturbances from tropical cyclones and tsunamis. Our analysis in the region's diverse socio-economic and environmental conditions highlights complex patterns of mangrove distribution and change. Results from this study provide important insight to the conservation and management of the important and threatened South Asian mangrove ecosystem.\"], ['This paper presents data on the impact of biotic pressure in terms of grazing by livestock and wood cutting by humans on the plant community in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve of India. Grass, and herbaceous plant biomass, number of cattle dung piles, number of woody stems available and damaged by human activities and weed biomass were assessed at different proximity along transects radiating from village-forest boundary to forest interior to measure the ecological impact of livestock grazing and fire wood collection. The grass biomass was positively correlated to overgrazing indicating the adverse effect on natural vegetation by cattle. Woodcutting was intense along the forest boundary and significantly declined as distance increased. Similarly, weed biomass and number of thorny species declined positively with proximity from village-forest boundary and the weed biomass was significantly higher in the pastoral sites compared to residential sites. The results suggest that human impact adversely affects natural vegetation and promotes weed proliferation in forest areas adjoining human settlements in the ecologically important Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Continued anthropogenic pressure could cause reduction in fodder availability to large herbivores like elephants, which in turn leads to an increase in human–elephant conflict.'], ['Pseudophilautus comprises an endemic diversification predominantly associated with the wet tropical regions of Sri Lanka that provides an opportunity to examine the effects of geography and historical climate change on diversification. Using a time-calibrated multi-gene phylogeny, we analyze the tempo of diversification in the context of past climate and geography to identify historical drivers of current patterns of diversity and distribution. Molecular dating suggests that the diversification was seeded by migration across a land-bridge connection from India during a period of climatic cooling and drying, the Oi-1 glacial maximum around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. Lineage-through-time plots suggest a gradual and constant rate of diversification, beginning in the Oligocene and extending through the late Miocene and early Pliocene with a slight burst in the Pleistocene. There is no indication of an early-burst phase of diversification characteristic of many adaptive radiations, nor were there bursts of diversification associated with favorable climate shifts such as the intensification of monsoons. However, a late Miocene (8.8 MYA) back-migration to India occurred following the establishment of the monsoon. The back migration did not trigger a diversification in India similar to that manifest in Sri Lanka, likely due to occupation of available habitat, and consequent lack of ecological opportunity, by the earlier radiation of a sister lineage of frogs (Raorchestes) with similar ecology. Phylogenetic area reconstructions show a pattern of sister species distributed across adjacent mountain ranges or from different parts of large montane regions, highlighting the importance of isolation and allopatric speciation. Hence, local species communities are composed of species from disparate clades that, in most cases, have been assembled through migration rather than in situ speciation. Lowland lineages are derived from montane lineages. Thus, the hills of Sri Lanka acted as species pumps as well as refuges throughout the 31 million years of evolution, highlighting the importance of tropical montane regions for both the generation and maintenance of biodiversity.'], [\"The genus Chlorophytum consists of medicinally important species like Chlorophytum borivilianum, C.\\xa0tuberosum and C.\\xa0attenuatum. Uncontrolled harvest of this plant from wild habitat due to its high commercial value made the species of this genus be listed in the Red Data Book of Indian plants as an endangered species. In India, approximately nineteen species of Chlorophytum are found; out of these, only C.\\xa0borivilianum is cultivated commercially. The objective of this study was to measure genetic diversity, population structure and phylogenetic relationship among the species using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP). Fifteen pairs of primer (out of 64 primer pairs screened) were used to analyse the genetic diversity in eighteen species of genus Chlorophytum. Cluster analysis, estimation of the gene flow among the species and of the phylogeographic distribution of this genus were carried out using an AFLP data matrix. A high level of genetic diversity was observed on the basis of the percentage of polymorphic bands (99.91%), Shannon's information index (0.3592) and Nei's gene diversity (0.2085) at species level. Cluster analysis of UPGMA dendrogram, principal component analysis and Bayesian method analysis resolved these species in three different clusters, which was supported by morphological information. The Mantel test (r\\xa0=\\xa00.4432) revealed a significant positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances. The collected data have an important implication in the identification, authentication, and conservation of the species of the genus Chlorophytum.\"], ['Protected areas (PAs) often depend on landscapes surrounding them to maintain flows of organisms, water, nutrients, and energy. Park managers have little authority over the surrounding landscape although land use change and infrastructure development can have major impacts on the integrity of a PA. The need for scientifically-based regional-scale land use planning around protected areas is acute in human-dominated landscapes to balance conservation goals with livelihood needs for fuelwood, fodder, and other ecosystem services. As a first step, we propose the designation of a “zone of interaction” (ZOI) around PAs that encompasses hydrologic, ecological, and socioeconomic interactions between a PA and the surrounding landscape. We illustrate the concept by delineating the ZOI in three Indian PAs – Kanha, Ranthambore, and Nagarahole – using remote sensing, population census, and field data. The ZOI in Ranthambore is three times the size of the park and is largely defined by the socioeconomic interactions with surrounding villages. Ranthambore is located in headwaters and wildlife corridors are largely severed. In Nagarahole, the ZOI is more than seven times larger than the park and includes upstream watershed and elephant corridors. Kanha’s ZOI is approximately four times larger than the park and is mostly defined by contiguous surrounding forest. The three examples highlight the differing extents of ZOIs when applying equivalent criteria, even though all are located in densely-populated landscapes. Quantitative understanding of which activities (e.g. collection of forest products, grazing, road construction, tourism development) and which locations within the ZOI are most crucial to conservation goals will enable improved land use planning around PAs in human-dominated landscapes.'], ['Thermally activated building system (TABS) is a hydronic cooling system, in which cold water is circulated through pipes embedded in the building structure to remove the heat from the indoor space. This paper proposes a hybrid passive cooling system, in which TABS is integrated with a cooling tower. The performance of this integrated system greatly depends on the climatic conditions of the geographical area. Hence, the feasibility of the proposed system to provide thermal comfort in twelve Indian cities spread over five different climatic regions is investigated using COMSOL Multiphysics. Different cooling scenarios like Roof and Floor cooled TABS (RF) and All Surfaces cooled TABS (AS) are compared. The proposed system performs well in arid and semi-arid regions, and the RF scenario is sufficient to achieve thermal comfort. The system is able to reduce the indoor operative temperature by 14\\xa0°C for the arid climatic conditions of Jaipur. In the other three regions, i.e., humid subtropical, tropical wet and dry and tropical wet regions, the performance of the proposed system is relatively low and the AS scenario is required to achieve thermal comfort.'], ['The use of various modeling approaches is critical in the assessment of ecosystem services. Although numerous assessments have been conducted as scholarly studies to quantify, map, and value ecosystem services, a well-structured platform is necessary to ensure consistency of the assessment approaches with regard to theories and practices. To identify gaps between practical ecosystem services assessments and scholarly studies in the Asian region, we reviewed assessment cases in the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) catalogue and peer-reviewed literature using Web platforms. We identified 31 assessment cases and 290 such peer-reviewed studies conducted throughout Asia. Our review of recent peer-reviewed studies revealed a bias in the geographic distribution, with numerous Chinese studies and few studies in West Asia. Our comparison of the approaches applied in the assessment cases with those in the peer-reviewed studies revealed that little information on the models was reported in the assessment cases, whereas the approaches used in the peer-reviewed studies were mostly modeling and biophysical indicators. Although the modeling and scenario approaches used in the actual assessments require further clarification in the IPBES catalogue, many scientific modeling studies have been conducted throughout Asia. These scientific data, however, are not easily accessible to those outside of academic communities. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a new catalogue to guide all the stakeholders involved in ecosystem services assessment at multiple scales.'], ['A taxonomic revision of Stenosiphonium Nees is provided. Morphological variation within the genus is documented, the relationship between Stenosiphonium and Strobilanthes Blume is discussed, and problems of species delimitation are resolved.

Climate is one of the most critical factors affecting biomes and their distribution. The present study assessed shifts in biome types of India using the conceptual framework of Holdridge life zone (HLZ) model, minimum distance classifier and climatic datasets to assess the distribution pattern of potential biomes under climate change scenarios in India. Modelling was conducted on the entire region of India using various combinations; (i) current climate scenario, and, (ii) increased temperature and precipitation scenario. The geographical analysis identifies nineteen (19) HLZs in the Indian sub-continent; seven (7) biomes and nineteen (19) sub-biomes. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the biome map prepared for current climate scenario was 82.73% and 0.75, respectively. With the changes in increasing temperature and precipitation scenario, the modelling results predict significant decrease in the area cover for tropical deserts (plains), tropical desert scrubs (lower montane), tropical moist forests (lower montane) and tropical wet forests (lower montane). Along with these changes, there have been substantial increases in the area cover for tropical dry forests (plains) and tropical very dry forests (plains), especially in central and southern India. The results show shifts from very dry tundra (alvar) to dry tundra (alpine) and moist tundra (alpine) and in some places tropical moist forests (sub-alpine) as well. In central India, decrease in tropical moist forests (lower montane) has been observed, while an increase in the area cover of tropical rain forests (plains) in northeastern India has been observed. It is important to understand the impacts and vulnerabilities of projected climate change on forest ecosystems so that better management and conservation strategies can be adopted for biodiversity and forest dependent communities. The knowledge of impact mechanisms will identify adaptation strategies for some conditions which will help in decreasing the susceptibility to anticipated climate change in the forest sector.'], ['This paper deals with participatory research on the introduction and use of coir geotextiles for soil and water conservation in a small community pond in a watershed in south India.

This reduces the adoption time, and can bring significant increase in yield, or decrease in labour costs, helping to enhance productivity, sustainability and improvement of livelihood.'], [\"ObjectiveTo report the patterns of species diversity, and regenerating capacity in the forest of Nikyal valley in relation to environmental variables and underlying anthropogenic influence.MethodsA study area was selected in a traditionally managed mountain woody pasture during July 2012 to June 2013. The area was sampled by quadrat method. The quadrats were laid down at regular intervals of 150 m. The size of quadrats was kept 10×10, 5×5 and 1×1 m2 for trees, shrubs and herbs respectively. Density, frequency and cover were recorded. Importance value index of each plant species was calculated and plant communities were named after the plant species having the highest IV. Then diversity, its components and regenerating capacity were calculated with their formulas.ResultsShannon's diversity ranged from 2.75 to 3.31, Simpson's diversity, 0.90 to 0.95; Menhinick's diversity, 0.83 to 1.19; evenness, 0.41 to 0.65; species richness, 4.89 to 6.08 and maturity index, 30 to 44 species distribution pattern. Diversity values were similar to the other Himalayan forests. Pinus roxburghaii was the only regenerating species whereas the remaining four tree species including Qurecus dilatata regenerate up to 100 cm; they are at extreme risk of elimination due to anthropogenic factors.ConclusionsNikyal valley is under severe deforestation pressure for fuel and timber value.

Currently, the thermal energy demand of any city is mostly satisfied by the conventional resources. It produces considerable strain on fossile fuel reserves and lead to increase green house gas emissions also. The thermal demand of city can be satisfied by integrative use of renewable energy resources. This integrative use needs modelling and optimization. In this paper, optimised combinations of three renewable energy systems, such as solar water heating systems, biomass gasifiers and biogas energy systems are presented to satisfy the thermal demand of a region. A Microsoft excel optimizer software is used to solve the multiobjective optimization problem to find the optimum combinations. Minimization of lifecycle cost and CO2 emission are considered as main two multiobjectives. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to solve the constraint optimization problem.

The disparate analytical vocabularies of the human and natural sciences were not designed for this purpose. The use of ecological concepts in anthropology has been contentious, while humans have continued to be located outside of most ecological thinking. Comparative analysis of past empires provides an opportunity to address this challenge. If we view the actions of past empires in terms of their environmental effects, we can also conceptualize these effects as specific forms of ecological action. Using the concept of ‘ecosystem engineer,’ this essay explores how this concept may facilitate comparison of imperial and colonial systems and, critically, how it may inflect and improve anthropogenic land cover change (ALCC) models which posit historical relationships between past population and land cover. At the same time, this exercise points to the analytical limits of this concept and perhaps of nondualist ontologies themselves.'], ['The terminology used to describe Palaeolithic industries has an important impact upon our interpretation of past behaviour. In South Asia, the term Late Palaeolithic is employed to refer to Late Pleistocene microlithic industries, distinguishing them chronologically from Holocene Mesolithic industries, and technologically from preceding Middle Palaeolithic technologies. Historically, however, an intermediate technological stage between Middle Palaeolithic and microlithic industries has been recognised and called ‘Upper’ Palaeolithic. Examining whether these ‘Upper’ Palaeolithic industries fit contemporary definitions of Middle or Late Palaeolithic technologies, distinct diversity within one of these technologies or a transitional phase between the two is therefore necessary to reintegrate these ‘Upper’ Palaeolithic sites into current debate. This is a particularly timely issue as the connection between some Late Palaeolithic artefact types, particularly backed microliths, and the earliest modern human populations in South Asia no longer appears tenable, and thus a rush to identify the earliest appearance of microliths must give way to more detailed examinations of behavioural variability. This paper re-examines lithic assemblages from Buddha Pushkar, western India, originally reported as an ‘Upper’ Palaeolithic industry. An attribute study of metric and categorical variables recorded on stone tools is used to examine how flaking technology, raw material use and reduction intensity vary within and between these assemblages. The results indicate raw material choices had a marked impact on stone tool technologies, nested within a pattern of technological diversity in western India during the terminal Pleistocene that complement models of regional trajectories in the evolution of Late Palaeolithic technologies.'], ['Forest carbon (C) estimates are the key inputs to the understanding of the global C cycle. We report the estimates of forest carbon pool and its spatial distribution in the Indian forests for the years 1994 and 2010 at 5\\xa0km grid level.

Decision-making documents in the Supreme Court and in one specific case of a bauxite mining conflict involving Vedanta in the Niyamgiri hills are studied to come to conclusions about how economic valuation of forests has moved through the political process. We argue that establishing NPV for forests is neither conducive to conservation nor to environmental justice for the following three reasons. The technical and political process of setting prices deepens and reproduces structural inequalities with negative distributive effects. NPV encourages economistic decision-making procedures that exclude participation. Finally NPV does not recognize or take into account cultural difference or plural values. We thus conclude that economic valuation of forest products and services has not managed to “save” forests in India and is not an effective or viable strategy for expressing the value of forests or for environmental conservation and environmental justice activism.'], ['Labeo rohita, popularly known as rohu is a widely cultured species in the whole Indian subcontinent. Knowledge of the genetic diversity of this species is important to support management and conservation programs which will subsequently help in sustainable production of this species. DNA markers, mostly microsatellite markers are excellent tool to evaluate genetic variation of populations. Genetic variation of three wild and one farm population was assessed using eleven microsatellite loci. In analyzing 192 samples, the number of alleles ranged from 4 to 23; observed heterozygosity 0.500 to 0.870 and expected heterozygosity from 0.389 to 0.878. Exact test for Hardy Weinberg disequilibrium revealed that each riverine sample had at least one locus not in equilibrium except one river. Negative inbreeding coefficients (FIS) were observed across populations indicating very high level of genetic diversity but little genetic differentiation among populations.'], ['This review study aimed to decipher distribution of trace metals (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Ni, Mn, V, and Zn) in different compartments and human health risk in the Sundarbans mangrove ecosystems. The literature suggested relatively higher contamination of soils and sediments than fish, crustaceans, and water. Cd, Fe, Ni, and Pb are most likely to accumulate in roots of mangrove trees, while Al, As, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, and Zn tend to accumulate in the leaves. According to human health risk studies, fish consumption is the main route of trace metals exposure to human. Majority of the studies conducted in the Indian Sundarbans; whereas, in Bangladesh part, there is an evident lack of such kind of studies. Finally, this review highlights the foremost data and research gaps, which will help to refine the risk of trace metals and scarcity of researches in the Sundarbans mangrove ecosystem.'], ['The late Cretaceous Corsinipollenites from central India and its nearest living fossil pollen Ludwigia from Pleistocene Karewa sediments in Kashmir shows morphometrical affinities with pollen of seven extant Ludwigia species (L. octovalvis (Jacq) P.H.

The Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Light Microscope (LM) study draws plausible lineage of extant Ludwigia species with that of fossil specimens recovered at two different time frames based on similarities in pollen morphometry. The pollen aperture and its character along with the sexine pattern were main identifiable features to distinguish different species of extant/fossil Ludwigia pollen. The aspidote aperture varies from brevi-colporate to slit-like colpi (colporate). The sexine is stenopalynous type characterized by rugulate to reti-rugulate pattern. The multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on the numerical data obtained from pollen morphometry of living and fossil Ludwigia spp. The Pleistocene Ludwigia morphotype with slit-like colpi shows close proximity to L. octovalvis, L. octovalvis subsp. sessiliflora and L. adscendens. However, Late Cretaceous, Corsinipollenitis characterized by brevicolpi is closer to L. perennis and L. hyssopifolia with respect to primary pollen characters and inferred as primitive species having lineage to the “Old World” (paleotropical) species.

The multi-temporal landuse/land cover features were extracted from the Landsat images (TM and ETM+, 30\\xa0m resolution) using a supervised classification technique with maximum likelihood classifier. The extracted features were classified into various landuse/ land cover categories with level I classification scheme of NRSC, India. Six major landuse classes such as forest, settlement, barren land, water bodies, agricultural land and fallow land were recognized. The overall accuracy for the year 1992, 2002, and 2012 shows 85.55%, 82.81% and 83.59% respectively. The overall Kappa coefficients for the datasets are near to 0.8, which indicates acceptable accuracy for landuse/ land cover classification. The results reveals that the spatial extent of forest, settlement and barren land has evolved in the past 20 years but, the water bodies, agricultural land and fallow land has reduced significantly. The reduction in agricultural land in the study area for the past 20 years is due to the combination of natural environment and socio-economic factors such as low rainfall in the plains, increased surface temperature, reduced soil moisture condition, high rate of evapo-transpiration, reduced water storage level in the reservoirs and ponds, and reduced vegetation cover. These factors are linked with climate change, it alters the socio-economic condition of the area, and such situation will affect the overall ecosystem in the Tamiraparani sub-basin in the near future.'], ['An optimal operation plan has been developed for the reservoirs in Kuttiadi river basin in Kerala using systems approach. A system consists of three reservoirs namely; Banasurasagar in Wayanad district,Kakkayam and Peruvannamuzhi in Kozhikode district has been taken for the study. Banasurasagar reservoir is in Kabbini river basin, which is an east flowing river and the remaining two are in Kuttiadi river basin, which is a west flowing river. They serve different purposes such as irrigation, domestic water supply and hydropower generation. These purposes were fulfilled based on the Standard Linear Operation Policy (SLOP) developed during the early stages of project formulation. Considering the deficit of water in the region, a system study has been done using multi-reservoir multi-purpose simulation technique, in which reservoir rule curve- based policy to optimally utilize the conservation storage of these three reservoirs have been developed. The generalised simulation model developed at the National Institute of Hydrology has been used to derive the rule levels and simulation of the system. The simulation studies reveal that the Banasurasagar reservoir and Peruvannamuzhi reservoir always serve the purposes of water supply without fail. For Banasurasagar reservoir, irrigation and water supply reliability is found to be 86% where as for Peruvanannamuzhi reservoir, it is 77%. The demand for power generation can be met with 90% dependability. Reservoir linked water supply can be thought of from Banasurasagar reservoir to Wayanad district like water supply from Peruvannamuzhi reservoir to Kozhikode district.'], ['Information on the spatial distribution of Hydrologically Active Areas (HAAs) in a watershed is an important input for many applications, such as hydrological modeling, water resource planning and flood estimation. HAAs can be delineated using a wetness index derived from either a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) or from satellite data. The purpose of this study was to develop and apply a methodology to delineate the HAAs in the Harangi (535 km2) and Hemavathy (2974 km2) watersheds located in Karnataka, India. Spatial distributions of HAAs derived from the DEM and from satellite data (Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor) were compared. It was found that wetness index obtained from satellite data was better able to capture the HAAs in comparison to the use of DEM. The delineated HAAs will be useful in identifying runoff generation areas and improve process representation in distributed hydrological modeling of the watershed.'], ['Kochi is a rapidly growing commercial, industrial and trading centre of Kerala. Due to the tremendous growth and urbanization, the density of population in city is increasing every year. These factors have resulted in land use stresses, reducing open areas especially wetlands [1] in Kochi city for the past decades through land reclamation and encroachments. Again, anthropogenic activities like industrialisation, improper management of sewage and other solid waste lead to degradation of these ecosystems. This study discusses about the unique status of wetlands of Kadamakudypanchayat of Kochi with its Pokkali fields [2], fish farms.

In an undisturbed, natural population of D. montana, female fecundity was not significantly influenced by distance to neighbours or by flower numbers on neighbours. In the same population fruit set was also unrelated to the angular dispersion of neighbours. On the other hand, in an altered population of this species in which conspecifics are extremely isolated due to human activities, insect visitation and fruit set were strongly and negatively correlated with distance to the nearest male. Moreover, the number of insects and fruit set in the natural population were significantly higher in the natural population than in the altered population. In the natural population, trees of large girth produced larger numbers of flowers in both sexes and females which produced larger numbers of flowers, also produced more fruits and fruit set (fruits/flower). In the altered population, fruit numbers and fruit set in female trees were unrelated to the flower numbers, which is possibly due to pollination limitation as a result of inadequate pollinator visits at female trees. Sex ratios were male-biased (3.7:1) in the natural population and female-biased (1:2) in the altered population of D. montana, as well as in G. talbotii (1:3.8) and D. sylvatica (1:12.2) populations where the lower girth classes are mainly cut. The girth class distribution of G. talbotii and D. sylvatica populations was skewed towards larger girths suggesting that future recruitment will be severely affected.'], ['Ethnopharmacological relevanceMore than 15,000 angiosperm species are dioecious, i.e., having distinct male and female individual plants. The allocation of resources between male and female plants is different, and also variation in secondary metabolites and sex-biased herbivory is reported among dioecious plants. However, little is known about the ethnobotany of dioecious species and whether preferences exist for a specific gender, e.g., in food, medicine or timber.Aim of the studyThe aim of this study was: 1) to study whether Indian folk healers have preference for plant genders, and to document their knowledge and use of dioecious species; 2) to understand the concept of plant gender in Indian systems of medicine and folk medicine, and whether Ayurvedic literature includes any references to gender preference.Materials and methodsLists of dioecious plants used in Indian systems of medicine and folk medicine were compiled. Ethnobotanical data was collected on perceptions and awareness of dioecious plants, and preferences of use for specific genders of dioecious species using semi-structured interviews with folk healers in Tamil Nadu, India. In addition, twenty Ayurvedic doctors were interviewed to gain insight into the concept of plant gender in Ayurveda.ResultsIndian systems of medicine contain 5–7% dioecious species, and this estimate is congruent with the number of dioecious species in flowering plants in general. Informants recognized the phenomenon of dioecy in 31 out of 40 species, and reported gender preferences for 13 species with respect to uses as timber, food and medicine. Among informants different plant traits such as plant size, fruit size, and visibility of fruits determines the perception of a plant being a male or female. Ayurvedic classical literature provides no straightforward evidence on gender preferences in preparation of medicines or treatment of illness, however it contains details about reproductive morphology and sexual differentiation of plants.ConclusionsA knowledge gap exists in ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological literature on traditional knowledge of dioecious plants. From this explorative study it is evident that people have traditional knowledge on plant gender and preferential usages towards one gender. Based on this, we propose that researchers conducting ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological studies should consider documenting traditional knowledge on sexual systems of plants, and test the existence of gender specific usages in their conceptual framework and hypothesis testing. Incorporating such concepts could provide new dimensions of scientific knowledge with potential implications to conservation biology, chemical ecology, ethnoecology and drug discovery.'], ['In this study, the production of camptothecine and its derivatives, in thirteen species of the family Icacinaceae, namely, Apodytes dimidiata, Codiocarpus andamanicus, Gomphandra comosa, Gomphandra coriacea, Gomphandra polymorpha, Gomphandra tetrandra, Iodes cirrhosa, Iodes hookeriana, Miquelia dentata, Miquelia kleinii, Natsiatum herpeticum, Pyrenacantha volubilis and Sarcostigma kleinii is reported. Seeds of M. dentata were found to produce the highest content of camptothecine (1.0–1.4% by dry weight of seeds). Full scan LC–MS and ESI-MS/MS analysis of M. dentata revealed, besides camptothecine, a number of other derivatives, namely, 10-hydroxycamptothecine, 9-methoxycamptothecine, 20-deoxycamptothecine.

This study presented new ways of combining rapid soil analysis using GIS and remote sensing imagery to provide a precision mapping of soil physical condition indicators in the study area and producing fertility status using Geostatistical approach. Study has been carried out to map the areas with physical degradation using remotely sensed data from Indian Remote Sensing LISS III sensor. It was observed that the data enabled better delineation of small units of eroded areas. Satellite data have been used for qualitative assessment of areas, being subject to soil erosion. Soil erosion was found to be none or slight to very sever using visual interpretation of IRS data along with field survey method where soil erosion was found to be moderate to high using the RUSLE method. The eroded areas of degraded lands will be used as an input for planning reclamation and conservation programs in Chamarajanagar district of Karnataka.Soil compaction is a form of physical degradation resulting in densification and distortion of the soil where biological activity, porosity and permeability are reduced, strength is increased and soil structure partly destroyed. Compaction can reduce water infiltration capacity and increase erosion risk by accelerating run-off. The compaction process can be initiated by wheels, tracks, rollers or by the passage of animals. Some soils are naturally compacted, strongly cemented or have a thin topsoil layer on rock subsoil. Soils can vary from being sufficiently strong to resist all likely applied loads to being so weak that they are compacted by even light loads.'], ['The use of biofuels can result on a decrease of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when compared to fossil fuels. However, the expansion of biofuels crops has been either based on direct or indirect displacement of natural ecosystems or on the use of degraded or marginal lands. The former results in direct habitat loss, whereas the later results in usual agricultural impacts (e.g., soil and biotic contamination and water eutrophication). However, in some circumstances biofuels crops can result on an increase in biodiversity compared to other agricultural crops. Agricultural zoning can mitigate the impacts of land use change (LUC), either direct (dLUC) or indirect (iLUC), whereas the use of wildlife-friendly techniques can mitigate the impacts of agriculture intensification. However, in both cases long-term biodiversity monitoring programs should be established in order to help the decision making process concerning the conflict between the expansion of biofuels crops and the conservation of biodiversity.'], ['This study presents a global analysis of forest cover and forest protection. An updated Global Forest Map (using MODIS2005) provided a current assessment of forest cover within 20 natural forest types. This map was overlaid onto WWF realms and ecoregions to gain additional biogeographic information on forest distribution. Using the 2008 World Database on Protected Areas, percentage forest cover protection was calculated globally, within forest types, realms and ecoregions, and within selected areas of global conservation importance. At the 10% tree cover threshold, global forest cover was 39\\xa0million\\xa0km2. Of this, 7.7% fell within protected areas under IUCN management categories I–IV. With the inclusion of IUCN categories V and VI, the level of global forest protection increased to 13.5%. Percentage forest protection (IUCN I–IV) varied greatly between realms from 5.5% (Palearctic) to 13.4% (Australasia), and for forest types from 3.2% (temperate freshwater swamp forest) to 28% (temperate broadleaf evergreen forest). Median protection of forest cover in 670 ecoregions (forest above a specified threshold) was 5.9% (IUCN I–IV); at IUCN I–VI, 46% of the ecoregions had less than 10% forest protection. Considering their biodiversity importance, forest protection within global priority areas was insufficient, e.g., median protection of 8.4% in biodiversity hotspots (IUCN I–IV). Results have policy relevance in terms of the target of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), reconfirmed in 2008, to effectively conserve “at least 10% of each of the world’s forest types”. Regular updates of these analyses would allow progress towards achieving that target to be monitored.'], [\"The paper provides a deep insight into the managerial aspects of Indian mangroves and highlights the transition of Indian forest policies and their impacts on these extensive coastal ecosystems.

Poit.) is one among the world's most noxious weeds. Bushmint is rapidly invading tropical ecosystems across the world, including India, and is major threat to native biodiversity, ecosystems and livelihoods. Knowledge about the likely areas under bushmint invasion has immense importance for taking rapid response and mitigation measures. In the present study, we model the potential invasion range of bushmint in India and investigate prediction capabilities of two popular species distribution models (SDM) viz., MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) and GARP (Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Production). We compiled spatial layers on 22 climatic and non-climatic (soil type and land use land cover) environmental variables at India level and selected least correlated 14 predictor variables. 530 locations of bushmint along with 14 predictor variables were used to predict bushmint distribution using MaxEnt and GARP. We demonstrate the relative contribution of predictor variables and species-environmental linkages in modeling bushmint distribution. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess each model's performance and robustness. GARP had a relatively lower area under curve (AUC) score (AUC: 0.75), suggesting its lower ability in discriminating the suitable/unsuitable sites. Relative to GARP, MaxEnt performed better with an AUC value of 0.86. Overall the outputs of MaxEnt and GARP matched in terms of geographic regions predicted as suitable/unsuitable for bushmint in India, however, predictions were closer in the spatial extent in Central India and Western Himalayan foothills compared to North-East India, Chottanagpur and Vidhayans and Deccan Plateau in India.\"], ['Global and regional species conservation efforts are hindered by poor distribution data and range maps. Many Indian primates face extinction, but assessments of population status are hindered by lack of reliable distribution data. We estimated the current occurrence and distribution of 15 Indian primates by applying occupancy models to field data from a country-wide survey of local experts. We modeled species occurrence in relation to ecological and social covariates (protected areas, landscape characteristics, and human influences), which we believe are critical to determining species occurrence in India. We found evidence that protected areas positively influence occurrence of seven species and for some species are their only refuge. We found evergreen forests to be more critical for some primates along with temperate and deciduous forests. Elevation negatively influenced occurrence of three species. Lower human population density was positively associated with occurrence of five species, and higher cultural tolerance was positively associated with occurrence of three species. We find that 11 primates occupy less than 15% of the total land area of India. Vulnerable primates with restricted ranges are Golden langur, Arunachal macaque, Pig-tailed macaque, stump-tailed macaque, Phayre’s leaf monkey, Nilgiri langur and Lion-tailed macaque. Only Hanuman langur and rhesus macaque are widely distributed. We find occupancy modeling to be useful in determining species ranges, and in agreement with current species ranking and IUCN status.

Farmers that cultivate on slopes everywhere face similar problems. Conservation technologies may reduce soil and nutrient losses, and thus enhance water holding capacity and soil fertility. But although these technologies promote sustainable crop production on steep slopes, the construction of physical structure such as bench terraces are often labour intensive and expensive to the farmers, since construction and maintenance require high investments. Here we studied the efficiency of coir geotextile with and without crop cultivation in reducing soil moisture deficiency on marginal slopes in Kerala, India. From the results it is evident that the slopes treated with geotextile and crops have the highest moisture retention capacity followed by geotextiles alone, and that the control plot has the lowest moisture retention capacity. As the poor and marginal farmers occupy the highland region, this method provides an economically viable option for income generation and food security along with slope stabilization.'], ['A new species of scorpion of the genus Neoscorpiops Vachon, 1980 is described from Northern Maharashtra.

However the challenge remains to make these markets benefit the poor and the environment. Increasing attention is being given to the potential role markets can play for agrobiodiversity conservation through product diversification and increasing competitiveness in niche and novelty markets. Several case studies were undertaken that explore the use of market-based approaches to on-farm agrobiodiversity management and livelihood improvement. This paper explores how the theory of collective action can provide a more synthetic understanding of how market chains operate, and the changes that could permit a more equitable distribution of benefits. The case studies illustrate the need for improved trust, mutual understanding of each actor’s involvement, and an agreed process of collective action with a high level of community participation. The cases differ in their degree of collective action, the level of market organization and the ways in which handling, processing, and innovative marketing add value to the agrobiodiversity products.

In particular, many numerical modeling studies have attempted to explain the longevity of steep escarpments that formed along continental edges at the transition between low elevation coastal plains and high elevation continental interiors, such as along the coasts of Africa and South America on both sides of the South Atlantic Ocean. In this paper, I review the wide and diverse body of observational constraints gathered to constrain the formation and evolution of passive margins escarpments, as well as the various mechanisms that have been proposed to explain their anomalously high topography. I then compile and summarize the findings of numerous numerical modeling studies that have been performed in the past twenty years to explain their formation and evolution. I show that many of these studies converged to agree that the longevity of passive margin escarpments depends on how rapidly they become and remain regional drainage divides and that this is primarily controlled by the flexural isostatic rebound associated with the erosion of the high elevation continental interior. To better quantify these findings, I derive and present a new analytical expression for the migration velocity of an escarpment once it has become a drainage divide. This expression is validated by a series of numerical experiments using 1D and 2D high resolution landscape evolution models. Interestingly, these models also predict that the rate of erosion at or near escarpments can be several orders of magnitude smaller than the rate of escarpment retreat. This may explain the apparent discrepancy between the low estimates of present-day erosion rates obtained mostly from cosmogenic nuclide studies (10m/Myr) and the long-term rates of escarpment retreat (1km/Myr).'], [\"Orchids have been used traditionally in various herbal preparations of which Dendrobium thyrsiflorum deserves special mention. However, in spite of being such an important medicinal plant taxa, information on the genetic diversity of the orchids is limited. In order to establish an association with antioxidant activity of D. thyrsiflorum, five geographically distinct populations of D. thyrsiflorum were analyzed. Total phenolics, flavonoids and alkaloid contents along with antioxidant activity measured by 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays revealed a significant level of variability across populations. Higher phytochemical activity was recorded in the representatives from Sikkim as compared to those from Mizoram. The genetic information obtained from fifty genotypes sampled from five natural populations using nine AFLP markers exhibited a total of 1207 scorable peaks of which 1188 peaks were polymorphic with high genetic diversity [percentage polymorphic bands (PPB)-98.50%; Shannon's index (I)- 0.42 and Nei's Gene Diversity index (h)\\xa0=\\xa00.28]. Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) revealed that variation amongst the populations was significantly higher than within the populations. Both UPGMA and STRUCTURE analyses were employed to estimate the genetic relationships of D. thyrsiflorum germplasm. Interestingly, both methods revealed similar grouping patterns. Further, statistical analysis of molecular data revealed that four out of these nine AFLP markers tested were found to be correlated with the antioxidant activity measured by DPPH assay. With no available genetic information like linkage maps and Quantative trait loci (QTL) available, the present research finding can be utilized for conservation strategy formulation of this important medicinal orchid with high antioxidant activity.\"], ['Sloping hills ravaged by shifting cultivation often causes soil erosion problems in the downstream cultivated lands.

These wetlands provide numerous ecological goods and services but are under tremendous stress due to rapid urbanization, industrialization and agricultural intensification, manifested by the shrinkage in their areal extent, and decline in the hydrological, economic and ecological functions they perform. This paper reviews the wetland wealth of India in terms of their geographic distribution and extent, ecosystem benefits they provide, and the various stresses they are exposed to. The paper also discusses the efforts at management of these fragile ecosystems, identifies the institutional vacuum and suggests priority area where immediate attention is required in order to formulate better conservation strategies for these productive systems.New hydrological insights for the regionIt has been found that management of wetlands has received inadequate attention in the national water sector agenda. As a result, many of the wetlands are subject to anthropogenic pressures, including land use changes in the catchment; pollution from industry and households; encroachments; tourism; and over exploitation of their natural resources. Further, majority of research on wetland management in India relates to the limnological aspects and ecological/environmental economics of wetland management. But, the physical (such as hydrological and land use changes in the catchment) and socio-economic processes leading to limnological changes have not been explored substantially.'], ['ObjectiveTo examine the phyto-constituents of Adiantum caudataum (A. caudataum), Adiantum latifolium (A. latifolium), Adiantum lunulatum (A. lunulatum), Christella dentata (C. dentate) and Christella parasitica (C. parasitica), to provide chemical marker and find inter- specific variation between the medicinally important genuses.MethodsThe dried and powered leaves materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 250 mL of petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, methanol, chloroform, acetone, benzene and water by using Soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. The aqueous extracts were filtered using Whattman filter paper (No.1) and then concentrated in vacuum at 40 °C using Rotary evaporator. The residues obtained were stored in a freezer −70 °C until further tests. Phytochemical screening of the extracts was carried out according to the standard methods.ResultsA total of five plants and 30 extracts were examined for the phytochemical screening. The crude extracts of A. caudataum, A. latifolium, A. lunulatum, C. dentata and C. parasitica showed varied degree of phyto-constituents with reference to solvents of the plant extracts. A total of three plants and 18 extracts were examined for the phytochemical screening A. caudataum, A. latifolium, A. lunulatum. The steroid is totally absent in the tested extracts of A. lunulatum. Similar to that caoboxylic acid also absent in A. caudatum and Coumarin showed its presence only in A. caudatum. A total of two plants and twelve extracts were examined for the phytochemical properties of Christella. Of which phenol is present in 11 extracts tested. Steroid is present only in one extract of C. parasitica and coumarin is present only in C. parasitica five extracts.ConclusionsThe present study result provids a simple and cheap tool (Chemical marker) for the characterization and identification of the medicinally important taxa. With the help the phytochemical screenings we can find inter- specific variation between the medicinally important genuses and easily we can differentiate the Adiantum and Christella genuses.'], ['ObjectiveTo examine the secondary metabolites present in the leaf extracts of Rhododendron arboreum Sm. ssp. nilagiricum (Zenker) Tagg.MethodsPhytochemical screening of the leaf extract was done to determine the phytochemical constituents in the various solvents studied.ResultsThe phytochemical study carried out on the leaf extracts of R. arboreum Sm. ssp. nilagiricum (Zenker) Tagg. confirm the existence of secondary metabolites such as phenols, saponins and tannins.ConclusionsThe study suggests that the leaf extracts of R. arboreum Sm. ssp. nilagiricum (Zenker) Tagg. can be best utilized in developing bioactive compounds against pathogenic infection.'], ['Here we test an application, based on the analysis of the metadata of geotagged photographs, to investigate the provision of recreational services by the network of wetland ecosystems in the state of Kerala, India. We estimate visitation to individual wetlands state-wide and extend, for the first time to a developing region, the emerging application of recreational ecosystem services (ES) modelling using data from social media and environmental quality data. The impacts of restoration of wetland areal extension and water quality improvement are explored as a means to inform sustainable management strategies. Findings show that improving water quality to a level suitable for the preservation of wildlife and fisheries could increase annual recreational visits by 13% (350,000) to wetlands state-wide. Results support the notion that passive crowdsourced data from social media has the potential to improve current ecosystem service analyses and environmental management practices also in the context of developing countries.'], ['Plasmodium vivax malaria is a globally widespread disease responsible for 50% of human malaria cases in Central and South America, South East Asia and Indian subcontinent. The rising severity of the disease and emerging resistance of the parasite has emphasized the need for the search of novel therapeutic targets to combat P. vivax malaria. Plasmepsin 4 (PM4) a food vacuole aspartic protease is essential in parasite functions and viability such as initiating hemoglobin digestion and processing of proteins and is being looked upon as potential drug target. Although the plasmepsins of Plasmodium falciparum have been extensively studied, the plasmepsins of P. vivax are not well characterized. This is the first report detailing complete PM4 gene analysis from Indian P. vivax isolates. Blast results of sequences of P. vivax plasmepsin 4 (PvPM4) shows 100% homology among isolates of P. vivax collected from different geographical regions of India. All of the seven Indian isolates did not contain intron within the coding region. Interestingly, PvPM4 sequence analysis showed a very high degree of homology with all other sequences of Plasmodium species available in the genebank. Our results strongly suggest that PvPM4 are highly conserved except a small number of amino acid substitutions that did not modify key motifs at active site formation for the function or the structure of the enzymes. Furthermore, our study shows that PvPM4 occupies unique phylogenetic status within Plasmodium group and sufficiently differ from the most closely related human aspartic protease, cathepsin D. The analysis of 3D model of PM4 showed a typical aspartic protease structure with bi-lobed, compact and distinct peptide binding cleft in both P. vivax and P. falciparum. In order to validate appropriate use of PM4 as potential anti-malarial drug target, studies on genetic and structural variations among P. vivax plasmepsins (PvPMs) from different geographical regions are of utmost importance for drugs and vaccine designs for anti-malarial strategies.'], ['Red ferruginous (RF) soils of tropical Indian environments belong to Entisols, Inceptisols, Alfisols, Mollisols and Ultisols soil orders. The occurrence of Ultisols alongside acidic Alfisols and Mollisols in both zeolitic and non-zeolitic parent materials in humid tropical (HT) climatic environments, indicates that the soil diversity in India is large. These soils are not confined to a single production system and generally maintain a positive organic carbon (OC) balance without adding significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. This review presents a synthesis of literature on the recent developments on the pedology of RF soils, including their physical, chemical, biological, mineralogical and micro-morphological properties, and their degradation status. It also addresses the changes in soil properties in semi-arid tropical (SAT) areas, created by climate shift during the Holocene. This knowledge contributed to our understanding as to how the parent material composition influences the formation of Alfisols, Mollisols and Ultisols in weathering environments of HT climate; and also as to how the relict Alfisols of SAT areas are polygenetic. The state-of-the-art information developed through the extensive work on such soils has helped establish an organic link between pedogenetic processes and bulk soil properties, and has provided an insight of many pedological and edaphological issues related to Alfisols, Mollisols and Ultisols mainly of HT climate. The synthesis has helped us to understand as to why the formation of Oxisols from Ultisols is an improbable genetic pathway in tropical environment of India and elsewhere in the world. There is a strong need to modify the mineralogy class of highly weathered RF soils. We hope this review will help to dispel some of the myths on the formation of tropical soils and their low fertility by putting in context their characteristics and capacity to be productive.'], ['Invasive species are capable of causing considerable damage to natural ecosystems, agriculture and economies throughout the World. Samsum ant, Brachyponera (Pachycondyla) sennaarensis has been a reason for medical implication and social nuisance through its poisonous and severely painful sting causing anaphylactic shock in many cases. We surveyed for the presence of the samsum ant in various provinces of Saudi Arabia. B. sennaarensis was the abundant Ponerinae species in human settlements. In the Eastern provinces, however, few samples were collected, and none were found in the Northern and Western provinces. Infestations of B. sennaarensis were particularly severe in the spring and summer seasons, when the ants make nests in moist areas and in cracks in cemented structures, whereas the extent of infestation reduced in winter seasons.'], [\"ObjectiveTo develop an efficient protocol for in vitro multiplication of the ethnomedicinal shrub Acacia caesia (A. caesia) L. Willd.,MethodsLeaf explants were inoculated on MS medium supplemented with TDZ and NAA for callus induction. Subculturing experiments were conducted by using leaf derived calli for shoot proliferation on MS medium fortified with various growth regulators like IBA, TDZ, BAP and GA3. The regenerated shoots were rooted in half strength MS medium supplemented with various concentrations of IBA, IAA and Kn. After roots were developed, the plantlets were transplanted to pots filled with garden soil, sand and vermicompost and kept in growth chamber with 70%–80% humidity under16h photoperiod. After acclimatization, the plantlets were transferred to the garden and survival percentage was calculated. Data were statistically analyzed and means were compared using Duncan's Multiple Range Test (P <0.05).ResultsAn in vitro multiplication protocol was developed for the locally demanded medicinal plant species, A. caesia by using leaf explant. The study revealed that the callus formation was effective in MS medium containing TDZ and NAA at 1.5 and 0.3 mg/L respectively. Shoot induction was most successful in MS medium supplemented with combination of the auxin, IBA and cytokinin, TDZ at 2.0 and 0.5 mg/L respectively. A single leaf explant was capable of producing 12 shoots/callus after 30 days of culture. The other supplementation in MS medium with IBA and Kn at 2.0 and 0.4 mg/L respectively produced higher rooting frequency, roots/shoot and root length. The survivability rate of leaf callus derived plantlets was significantly higher (84%) in the hardening medium composed by garden soil, sand and vermicompost (1:1:1) by volume.ConclusionsA significant progress has been made in the in vitro regeneration system of this medicinally important plant species, A. caesia.\"], ['Herbicide-resistant (HR) rice has the potential to improve the efficiency of weed management and facilitate adoption of resource conservation technologies (RCTs) in India. However, several important risks associated with HR rice should be examined before its widespread adoption is encouraged. The greatest risk in the commercialization of HR crops is the potential for transfer of the gene conferring the HR trait to related wild and weedy relatives. This could lead to increased weediness or invasiveness. Gene transfer between cultivated and wild or weedy rice is known to occur and existing scientific literature confirms that HR genes can move from HR rice to wild and weedy relatives forming hybrids. The likelihood of such gene transfer is especially high in India, where cultivated rice and its relatives are sympatrically distributed and their flowering times overlap. Such gene flow can impact crop invasiveness, fitness of wild species, and the loss of native biodiversity. Additionally, HR rice may contribute to the problems of crop volunteers and evolution of herbicide resistance. Based on existing scientific literature, it appears that these risks are low, but that additional studies are needed to fully assess the potential adverse consequences of widespread adoption of HR rice in India.'], ['This paper focuses on lessons learnt from Cleaner Production (CP) experiences in textile bleaching and dyeing (hosiery) clusters in India. The regional and industry contexts for CP are demonstrated by outlining the interaction and interdependency between the urban and rural environment, and an industry cluster centered on Tirupur City. A policy for fostering water use productivity in the industry cluster is discussed, which shows how that in order for resource productivity to be maintained, regional and industry CP strategies should be aligned. This is illustrated by a discussion on CP lessons in water and chemicals conservation. The paper also recommends future areas of CP investigations required in the industry to make it ecologically sustainable in the long-term.'], ['Change in Land Cover and Land Use (LCLU) influences the runoff characteristics of a drainage basin to a large extent, which in turn, affects the surface and groundwater availability of the area, and hence leads to further change in LCLU. This forms a vicious circle. Hence it becomes essential to assess the effect of change in LCLU on the runoff characteristics of a region in general and of small watershed levels (sub-basin levels) in particular. Such an analysis can effectively be carried out by using watershed simulation models with integrated GIS frame work. SWAT (Soil and Water Analysis Tool) model, being one of the versatile watershed simulation models, is found to be suitable for this purpose as many GIS integration modules are available for this model (e.g. ArcSWAT, MWSWAT). Watershed simulation using SWAT requires the land use and land cover data, soil data and many other features. With the availability of repository of satellite imageries, both from Indian and foreign sources, it becomes possible to use the concurrent local land use and land cover data, thereby enabling more accurate modelling of small watersheds. Such availability will also enable us to assess the effect of LCLU on runoff characteristics and their reverse impact. The current study assesses the effect of land use and land cover on the runoff characteristics of two watersheds in Kerala, India. It also assesses how the change in land use and land cover in the last few decades affected the runoff characteristics of these watersheds. It is seen that the reduction in the forest area amounts to 60% and 32% in the analysed watersheds. However, the changes in the surface runoff for these watersheds are not comparable with the changes in the forest area but are within 20%. Similarly the maximum (peak) value of runoff has increased by an amount of 15% only. The lesser (aforementioned) effect than expected might be due to the fact that forest has been converted to agricultural purpose with major portion as plantations which have comparatively similar characteristics of the forest except for evapo-transpiration. The double sided action (increase in evapo-transpiration owing to species like rubber and increase percolation due to its plantation method by using terracing) might be the reason for relatively smaller effect of the land use change, not commensurate with the changes in the forest area amounting to 60% and 32% for Manali and Kurumali watersheds respectively. Water harvesting methods like rain harvesting ditches can be made mandatory where species with high evapo-transpiration are grown. This action shall enhance the groundwater percolation and shall counter act the effect due to high evapo-transpiration.'], ['The Mughal settlements are an integral part of Old Dhaka. Uncontrolled urbanization, changes in land use patterns, the growing density of new settlements, and modern transportation have brought about rapid transformation to the historic fabric of the Mughal settlements.

Different solvent extractions were made for the preliminary screening of phytochemicals and their total flavonoids and polyphenols levels were quantified using standard procedures. Finally, the extracts were studied for their antioxidant potential by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and chelating effects on ferrous ions.ResultsPhytochemical screening of the plant shows the presence of various biochemicals like alkaloid, tannins, terpenoids, saponins, flavonoids and resins and absence of phlobatannins. Flavanoids were high with water extracts (6.14 mg/g) and showed high 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity (77.25%) whereas total polyphenols was high with methanol extraction (12.12 mg/g). Ethylacetae extract showed poor flavanoid and polyphenol content which reflected their low antioxidant potential when compared to other extracts.ConclusionsThe present study confirms the presence of various phytochemicals which shows good antioxidant potential of S. minor. This work will be helpful to explore the biochemical profile and active compound identification in the field of pharmaceutical research.'], ['Much of India contains complex and ambiguous post-colonial environmental histories. Within the international clean cookstove development discourse, it is assumed that fuelwood collection for cooking is a significant factor in the overexploitation of forest biomass. This brand of storytelling is certainly applied in India where a series of programs have long targeted household fuelwood collection activities as a way of reversing rates of deforestation. This essay outlines the enigmatic and peculiar environmental histories of two distinct regions in South India. Based on oral histories, interviews and field surveys our findings indicate that many pressures other than fuel collection have helped alter vegetation and reduce fuel availability, particularly the expansion of commercially cultivated land in recent years. Moreover, a variety of historical contingencies, such as mass displacement from dam construction and the deliberate seeding of an invasive species complicate one-dimensional or reductive explanations of landscape change — a discursive environmental rendering referred to here as a ‘disingenuous nature’. Through retrospective analysis, we describe how this land use narrative, like so many other sustainable development discourses premised on incomplete and misleading information, is the byproduct of a ‘multi-scale narrative repurposing and sector coalescence’ process. This characterization signals how environmental narratives are repurposed and recycled uncritically by actors in distinct yet discursively compatible development sectors.'], ['The sustainable livelihood approach is an analytical framework that helps identifying the assets that local communities rely on, the risks they are subjected to, organisations and institutions influence their daily lives and the strategies they undertake. This is a valuable approach in small-scale fisheries management as artisanal fisheries are exposed to uncertainty in terms of supply and demand, and fishing activities usually are influenced by social and institutional factors. However, in spite of its usefulness and the fact that this approach has been previously used in projects targeting small-scale fisher communities, it is still not widely applied to small-scale fisheries. In this study we applied the sustainable livelihood approach as an analytical tool to assess the potential of the mud crab Scylla serrata as a sustainable livelihood resource for the southwest Indian states such as Karnataka. As fishers worldwide face continuous pressure from industrial fishing fleets and decreased fish stocks and their productivity, we also identified what could be the potential barriers to small-scale mud crab farming for communities that are already are involved in mud crab fishing. Data were collected and analysed from a semi-structured questionnaire, two focus group discussions and key informant interviews conducted in Uttara Kannada district, Karnataka. The results indicated that though mud crab is perceived as a good source of income in this area, at present it is not recognised as a steady source of income due to the unpredictable fishery catches. Respondents were aware of mud crab farming yet stated the lack of land and financial resources as the main barriers and only the minority expressed any interest in undertaking such activity. The sustainable livelihood approach proved to be a valuable research tool for identifying matters of concern for local communities regarding their source of livelihoods and barriers to small-scale aquaculture.'], ['The importance of genetic variation for maintaining biological diversity and evolutionary processes is widely accepted; however, limited action has been taken to protect genetic diversity in natural populations. Until recently, it was assumed that the exploitation of non-timber forest products, such as fruits, barks and exudates, had low environmental impact, but recognition that the harvesting of these plants can affect several biological levels, including genetic diversity and structure, has been growing. Nevertheless, the effect of harvesting non-timber forest products on the genetic diversity of the harvested species is poorly understood. The objective of this work is to assess the impact of harvesting on the genetic diversity of Himatanthus drasticus (Apocynaceae), a tree of the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) that is highly exploited for its medicinal latex. We tested the hypothesis that harvesting can cause a trade-off between survival and reproduction in H. drasticus, reducing the effective population size as well as the genetic diversity in highly exploited populations. The study was conducted in the Araripe National Forest, a preserved Cerrado area in Ceará State, Brazil. We sampled six populations that included two different levels of harvesting (high-harvest and low-harvest) and characterized the genetic diversity and structure in two groups (adults and seedlings) using microsatellite markers. We verified high levels of polymorphism in H. drasticus; however, significant levels of inbreeding in all studied populations were also observed. We found a higher degree of genetic structure in the seedling group when compared with the adult group, a difference that was most likely due to seed rain deposited in nearby locations. No differences were detected in adult genetic diversity levels between populations under different harvesting intensities. However, seedling allelic richness was significantly lower in the high-harvested populations, indicating allelic losses that may be associated with the exploitation of bark and latex. Evidence of genetic loss due to overharvesting was supported by significant bottleneck signatures observed in the seedling group of two out of three high-harvest populations. The establishment of a conservation strategy is imperative to avoid future genetic losses and ensure the long-term viability of H. drasticus populations. The information obtained in this study has been integrated with ecological information about the effects of latex tapping on phenology, demography and biomass recovery of exploited populations, with the goal of proposing a sustainable management plan for the species.'], [\"One-fifth of the world's reptiles are currently estimated as threatened with extinction, primarily due to the immediate threats of habitat loss and overexploitation. Climate change presents an emerging slow-acting threat. However, few IUCN Red List assessments for reptiles explicitly consider the potential role of climate change as a threat. Thus, climate change vulnerability assessments can complement existing Red List assessments and highlight further, emerging priorities for conservation action.Here we present the first trait-based global climate change vulnerability assessment for reptiles to estimate the climate change vulnerability of a random representative sample of 1498 species of reptiles. We collected species-specific traits relating to three dimensions of climate change, sensitivity, low adaptability, and exposure, which we combined to assess overall vulnerability.We found 80.5% of species highly sensitive to climate change, primarily due to habitat specialisation, while 48% had low adaptability and 58% had high exposure. Overall, 22% of species assessed were highly vulnerable to climate change. Hotspots of climate change vulnerability did not always overlap with hotspots of threatened species richness, with most of the vulnerable species found in northwestern South America, southwestern USA, Sri Lanka, the Himalayan Arc, Central Asia and southern India. Most families were found to be significantly more vulnerable to climate change than expected by chance.Our findings build on previous work on reptile extinction risk to provide an overview of the risk posed to reptiles by climate change. Despite significant data gaps for a number of traits, we recommend that these findings are integrated into reassessments of species' extinction risk, to monitor both immediate and slow-acting threats to reptiles.\"], ['The high elevational areas in the Himalayas of India are dominated by forests and alpine pastures. There are many protected areas in the region, including Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) and Valley of Flowers (VOF) where natural resource management plan (NRMP) has been implemented for the conservation of biodiversity. This has affected the traditional animal husbandry system, as well as the vegetation dynamics of alpine pastures. An integrated approach to studying the impact of NRMP in the region has been applied by us. First, a survey was conducted regarding livestock management, data pertaining the livestock husbandry, the role of animal husbandry in economics of rural household, and socioeconomics. Second, field based study on phytosociology of some important alpine herbs was done to enumerate the density and species richness in different land mark of the region. Thereafter, satellite data and Geographic Information System (GIS) were used to develop a land cover map of the area and to note changes in the landscape over time after implementation of NRMP. From an economic point of view the implementation of such plan is a setback to the rural economy. However, the ecological perspective of such models is a threat to the diversity of alpine pastures. The invasion of bushes/thorny bushes/shrubs and weeds with their luxuriant growth is changing the vegetation index and dynamics. Consequently, the diversity of herbs in alpine pastures of the Himalayan Mountains is in jeopardy. Overall, the situation is leading to landscape change in the region. This study is helpful for generating useful outcomes and strategies considering the question or debate “is grazing good or bad for pasture ecosystems in the Himalayas?”.'], [\"ObjectiveTo develop an improved protocol for micropropagation of ethnomedicinally important Scoparia dulcis (S. dulcis) L.MethodsExplants were inoculated on MS basal medium supplemented with kinetin and 6-benzylaminopurine for shoot bud induction.

This study reports the results of an ethnopharmacological survey on the uses of medicinal plants by inhabitants of the Thoppampatti.Materials and methodsThe field study was carried out in a period of about one year (April 2012–May 2013) in Thoppampatti village. The information was obtained through open and semi-structured interviews with 48 (27 males, 21 females) knowledgeable local people and traditional healers (THs). The collected data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, use value (UV), relative importance (RI) and Jaccard index (JI) was determined.ResultsA total of 139 species of plants, mostly trees and herbs, belonging to 54 families were identified in this study. This is used to treat 142 diseases and ailments. These ailments were categorized into 18 major categories. Leaves were the most frequently used parts, while decoction and juice are the most common method of preparation to treat various diseases. Based on IUCN Red data the identified medicinal plants include 11 least concerned species, 3 vulnerable species and one endangered species. The most important species according to their use value were Cynodon dactylon (0.79), Azadirachta indica (0.73), Ocimum tenuiflorum (0.71), Moringa oleifera (0.68), Coriandrum sativum (0.62), Abelmoschus esculentus (0.61), Acalypha indica (0.59) and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis (0.59).ConclusionAs a result of the present study, medicinal plants play an important role in the health care of Thoppampatti village inhabitants; they rely on medicinal plants to treat various ailments. In addition, the medicinal plants with high RI values might give some useful leads for further pharmacological investigations.

To understand its suitable bioclimatic distribution, maximum entropy based on ecological niche modeling was used to model the bioclimatic niches of the species in its Asian range. Based on known occurrences, bioclimatic areas with higher probabilities are mainly located in the eastern and western coasts of the Indian Peninsula, the east of Sumatra Island, some areas in the Malay Archipelago, and the southeast coastal areas of China. Some undocumented places were also predicted as suitable areas. According to the jackknife procedure, the minimum temperature of the coldest month, the mean monthly temperature range, and the precipitation of the wettest month were identified as highly effective factors in the distribution of black pepper and could possibly account for the crop's distribution pattern. Such climatic requirements inhibited this species from dispersing and gaining a larger geographical range.\"], ['Emissions from deforestation are significant and account for more than 18% of global annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. With the Bali Action Plan categorically placing reduced emissions from degradation and deforestation (REDD) activities on the agenda of future climate change negotiations, there is now a strong possibility that policy approaches and incentives relating to enhancement of carbon stocks in low biomass forests will be successfully negotiated and accepted as a legitimate greenhouse gas mitigation option in the upcoming post-2012 climate change regime. Using the institutional mechanisms provided by community-based forest management (CBFM), 833.8\\xa0Tg carbon can be sequestered by enhancement of forest carbon stocks in low biomass Indian forests. By protection refugia, restoring biodiversity, providing connectivity, mimicking nature in plantations and controlling man-made fires, CBFM as practiced in India can be an effective way of managing forests during times of climate change. Appropriately designed CBFM policy can provide means to sustain and strengthen community livelihoods and at the same time avoid deforestation, restore forest cover and density, provide carbon mitigation and create rural assets. Channeling carbon investment funds into CBFM projects can make both development and conservation economically viable and attractive for the local communities to maintain biodiversity and integrity of nature. However, before actual funding under the Clean Development Mechanism and other international C investment funds is available, policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to REDD need to be negotiated and agreed upon by the participating nations to UNFCCC.'], ['Determining economically viable and highly efficient strategic locations for utility-scale solar power plants is a costly procedure that depends on several factors. This paper investigates the spatial suitability for installations of ground-mounted solar farms based on legal, social, technical, economic, environmental and cultural perspectives through the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis combined with Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique. A set of six exclusion criteria are identified and removed from the map layer considered exploitable for construction. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is then used to determine the weights of nine selected evaluation criteria found to influence the placements of the farms. Proximity raster layers were derived from features including road network and high transmission lines, overlain with a 10\\u202fm\\u202f×\\u202f10\\u202fm raster terrain layers which includes elevation, slope and aspect and finally combined with interpolated raster dataset of climatological parameters comprising of global solar radiation, sunshine duration, air temperature and relative humidity. This combinatorial process through the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) technique generated a high resolution solar resource potential atlas classifying regions on the island from high to low potential for solar farm placement. Further analysis of highly suitable sites with aerial images of the localities of interest resulted in the identification of 3 best sites all situated in the northern plains of the island. The approach demonstrated is expected to help reduce time, money and resources presently allocated towards identifying and assessing hot spots for the construction of solar power plants in Mauritius.'], ['Anthropogenic fires have strong impacts in tropical rainforests that are not necessarily restricted to the burnt areas, as edge influence from the burnt patch may significantly alter the unburnt vegetation. Conversely, the remaining forest patches may mitigate changes in microclimate in the adjacent burnt areas. We studied variation in air and soil temperature in burnt and unburnt areas in the Atlantic forest of southern Bahia, Brazil. In November-December 2017, approx. two years after a series of wildfires, we sampled six transects at three burnt-unburnt edges, placing soil and temperature data loggers at the edge and at 20, 60, and 120\\u202fm into the burnt and unburnt areas and keeping them there for seven days. One data logger of each pair was buried at a depth of 3\\u202fcm and the other was kept at a height of 1\\u202fm above ground in a protective case. Air in the burnt area was cooler than in the forest at night and warmer in the morning, whereas soil was cooler than in the forest at night and early morning and warmer in the afternoon. We did not observe gradients in air or soil temperature, but soil temperature was more variable in the burnt area than in the unburnt forest. Conversely, notwithstanding the differences between diurnal and noctural temperatures, daily average, minimum and maximum air temperature varied little between the environments, possibly due to shading by bracken fern in the burnt areas. The variation in soil temperature is likely due to changes in vegetation structure, as the bracken fern does not provide as much shade and temperature control as the native forest canopy. Thus, even in the absence of strong effects on air temperature, changes in the temporal and spatial variability of soil temperature may be observed, with possible consequences for plant recruitment and soil organisms.'], ['Watershed prioritization has gained importance in natural resources management, especially in the context of watershed management. Delineation of watersheds within a large drainage basin and their prioritization is required for proper planning and management of natural resources for sustainable development. Delineation of potential zones for implementation of conservation measures above the entire watershed at similar occurrence is inaccessible as well as uneconomical; therefore it is a prerequisite to apply viable technique for prioritization of sub watersheds (SW). The present research attempted to study various morphological characteristics and to implement Geographical Information System (GIS) and Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) through Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) techniques for identification of critical sub watersheds situated in transaction zone between mountainous and water scarcity region of kallar watershed, Tamil Nadu. The morphometric characterization was obtained through the measurement of three distinct linear, areal and relief aspects over the eleven sub-watersheds. The morphometric characterization showed vital role in distinguishing the topographical and hydrological behavior of the watershed. Each morphometric parameters were ranked with respect to the value and weightings obtained by deriving the relationships between the morphometric parameters obtained through classification of the SW by associating the strength of Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Processes (FAHP). Based on FAHP approach, sub watersheds were evaluated and divided into five prioritization zones: very less, less, medium, high and very high classes. The FAHP techniques is a practical approach for identification of the sensitive priority zones and is useful for better management practices such as implementation of land and water resource management, conservation and sustainable agricultural development.'], ['ObjectiveTo conduct an ethnobotanical survey and collect information about the medicinal plants used in the treatments of various ailments by the Nadars of Atoor village of Kanyakumari district, Tamilnadu, India.MethodsInformation presented in this document was gathered from the Nadars using an integrated approach of botanical collections, discussions with the elderly people, traditional medicinal practitioners (locally known as Vaidhyars) and local faith healer and interviews with questionnaires in the years 2009-2010.ResultsA total of 89 plant species representing 47 families have been reported to be in use among the Nadars of the study area. Family wise distribution of medicinal plants shows Acanthaceae, Asclepiadaceae and Lamiaceae was the most speciose family with 5 genus and 5 species each and Liliaceae was the co-dominant family represented by 3 genus and 4 species. Of the 89 plants species, 14 were tree species, 18 shrubs, 47 herbs and 10 climbers.ConclusionThe study revealed that Nadars have a great faith in the traditional healing system and they rely on medicinal plants for treatment of various illnesses. Further studies on phytochemistry, pharmacology and pharmacognosy on these species may lead to the invention of novel bioactive compounds to treat pathogenic diseases.'], ['Large investments are being made in the establishment of tree plantations on degraded land in Asia. These initiatives are often politically driven and aspire to achieve both economic and environmental benefits. However, the lack of clarity about the precise objectives of these schemes means that they often fail to yield either local economic or global environmental benefits. There is often a failure to negotiate with all concerned stakeholders and to recognize and resolve trade-offs. Subsidies have often had perverse impacts, and market forces may be better drivers of economic objectives of restoration programmes. Security of tenure and use rights is an important but often neglected requirement for achieving sustainability. Remnant patches of natural vegetation, even when degraded, are often valuable sources of local biodiversity in restoration schemes. The spatial patterns of different types of forest and of non-forest land are important determinants of environmental values. Biodiversity conservation requires maintaining or re-establishing habitat strips to connect natural forest blocks and protect ecological gradients. However, even monoculture plantations often have significant biodiversity value. The fundamental principles of ecosystem approaches as adopted by the Convention for the Conservation of Biological Diversity and principles for successful common property resource management provide valuable frameworks for forest restoration schemes.'], ['Despite the availability of a wide range of tools, measuring and explaining changes in land cover and land use in tropical regions can be extremely challenging. Kerala, India, is a biodiversity hotspot with a high population density and a long history of complex agricultural land-use patterns. Some reports suggest that agriculture in Kerala, which historically is rice paddy-wetland and agroforestry-based, is on the decline. However, the evidence is often anecdotal, especially with regards to smallholding homegarden agriculture. In this study we employ mixed methods, including remote sensing, quantitative household surveys, and semi-structured interviews, to unravel the complex land-cover and land-use changes occurring in Kerala.Results indicate that, from a land-cover change perspective, agroforests are in dynamic equilibrium with other land covers, being cleared for roads and new buildings, but offset by the expansion of younger, less diverse agroforests into paddy wetlands. Yet beneath the canopy, agroforests are undergoing rapid land-use change not discernible using remote sensing. These changes include a reported decrease in the cultivation of 80% of Kerala’s primary crop species during 2003–2013, alongside a dramatic decline in chickens (from 12.5 to 2.6 per homestead on average) and cows (from 1.7 to 0.8). Over this period, no crop increased in cultivation. According to farmers, the primary drivers of this shift were declining profitability of agriculture in Kerala, labour shortages, unreliable weather, unfamiliar pests and diseases, and government policy.Despite the undeniable move away from agricultural activity in homegardens, we conclude that these ecologically and culturally important systems are not disappearing, but rather evolving to meet the needs of a less agricultural Kerala. Our research highlights the value of using mixed methods for characterizing land-use and land-cover histories in tropical regions.'], ['Highly efficient in vitro regeneration system has been developed for Swertia lawii Burkill, an important herb used as substitute for Swertia chirayita. Shoot tips explants were cultured on MS medium with various phytohormones for multiple shoot production. The best shoot production frequency (100%) and maximum shoots (10.4\\xa0±\\xa00.8) were obtained on MS media containing TDZ (3.0\\xa0mg\\xa0l−1) in combination with IBA (0.3\\xa0mg\\xa0l−1). Maximum callus induction (95\\xa0±\\xa04.8%) and callus growth (1.7\\xa0±\\xa00.4\\xa0gm) was achieved on MS medium with 2, 4-D (3.0\\xa0mg\\xa0l−1).

Environmental factors such as photoperiod and temperature activate the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis leading to the secretion of steroid hormones that are crucial for reproduction. Sex steroids are not only essential for the maturation of gonads, but also for development of secondary sexual characters in males and reproductive behaviour of both the sexes. In the present study, we quantified the urinary testosterone (UTM) and corticosterone (UCM) metabolites in males and urinary estradiol metabolites (UEM) and UCM in females of Nyctibatrachus humayuni for two consecutive years to determine annual and seasonal variation in the levels of sex steroids, corticosterone and body condition index (BCI). The results show that sex steroids were highest during the breeding season and lowest during the non-breeding season in both the sexes. An increase in UTM and UEM was observed in males and females respectively during the breeding season. Testicular histology showed the presence of all stages of spermatogenesis throughout the year indicating that spermatogenesis is potentially continuous. Ovarian histology showed the presence of vitellogenic follicles only during the breeding season indicating that oogenesis is strictly seasonal. In males, UCM levels were highest during the breeding season, while in females their levels were highest just prior to the breeding season. In males, BCI was highest during the pre-breeding season, declined during the breeding season to increase again during the post-breeding season. In females, BCI was comparable throughout the year. In males, UTM levels were positively correlated with UCM levels but negatively correlated with BCI. Interestingly, UEM, UCM and BCI were not correlated in females. These results indicate that N. humayuni exhibits an associated pattern of reproduction. Quantification of urinary progesterone metabolites (UPM) during the breeding season showed UPM levels were higher in post-spawning females, suggesting the significance of progesterone in ovulation. Further, non-invasive enzyme immunoassay has been successfully standardized in N. humayuni for the quantification of urinary metabolites of steroid hormones.'], ['Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterial organisms has emerged as one of the major diseases in captive elephants. In vitro Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) assay is being used as an ancillary test for early detection of TB in domestic and captive wild animals. In the present study, basic sequence information and immunological cross-reactivity of this major cytokine of Asian elephants were explored. At predicted amino acid level, IFN-γ of Asian elephant showed maximum identity to that of horse (73%). Other IFN-γ amino acid sequences that showed high level identity were that of giant panda (72%), dog (71%), nine-banded armadillo (69%), cattle (63%) and human (62%). IFN-γ promoter sequences of Asian elephant, human, cattle and mouse showed high level conservation of the putative transcription factor binding sites, TATA box and transcriptional start site. The functionally important human IFN-γ promoter elements, such as AP-2IRE-BE, YY1-γIFN-BED, ATFCS and AP-1γINF binding sites, were absolutely conserved in the corresponding elephant sequence. There was only a single nucleotide variation in the other two important elements, NFAT-γINF and IFN-γPE, indicating the highly conserved regulation of IFN-γ expression across different species. Phylogenetic analysis based on IFN-γ protein sequences revealed a closer relation of Asian elephants and nine-banded armadillo. This shows a closer evolution of these members of Afrotheria and Xenarthra, respectively; and supports the previous reports based on mitochondrial DNA studies. In Western blot analysis, IFN-γ of Asian elephant expressed in Escherichia coli was detected using an anti-bovine IFN-γ monoclonal antibody, indicating immunological cross-reactivity.'], ['This paper presents the results of a sustainability analysis carried out for the evaluation of two participatory watershed projects in Kerala, South India. For a watershed project to be sustainable, four groups of criteria should be considered related to natural resources, technology, institutions and economics, respectively. Poor performance in each of these groups can jeopardise sustainability. The process is as strong as the weakest shackle in the chain. For a watershed project to be sustainable, all these groups should perform above a minimum standard. In both projects studied, the weakest shackle in the sustainability chain appears to be the economic sustainability of the projects. If one element fails, sustainability cannot be achieved.'], ['Study on the dependence of orchids on fungi for seed germination and seedling development provides a mean for understanding the role of fungi in the orchid development process. The epiphytic orchid Coelogyne nervosa endemic to south India is exploited in an unsustainable manner for its therapeutic value. So a protocol for symbiotic seed germination was established for C. nervosa. We isolated a fungus by plating mycorrhizal root discs of the terrestrial orchid Eulophia epidendreae and identified it as Epulorhiza sp., by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the ribosomal RNA gene. Germination of C. nervosa seeds was higher when inoculated with Epulorhiza sp. Uninoculated seeds of C. nervosa ceased to develop soon after the initiation of germination, and the embryo failed to rupture the seed testa. The isolated fungal hyphae entered the germinating seeds either through the pores in-between the integuments, or through the rhizoids. After the fungal establishment (peloton formation) in embryonic cells, the embryo transformed into a protocorm and after 45 days, 66% of the germinated seeds were transformed into protocorms. Nevertheless, promeristem formation occurred only after fungal association. Sixty-three percent of the protocorms developed their first leaf by 90 days and 62% of these produced a second leaf by 120 days after fungal inoculation. All the seedlings in green leaf stage produced roots and contained fungal pelotons. Our results suggest that the Epulorhiza sp. could be successfully used in the in\\xa0vitro production of C. nervosa for their reintroduction into its natural environment.'], ['ObjectiveTo investigate the antibacterial activity and phytochemical properties of Begonia floccifera Bedd. (B. floccifera) methanolic flower extracts against the selected pathogens.Methods20 g of fresh flowers were soaked in 100 mL methanol for 48 h at room temperature. After 48 h, the extracts were filtered using Whatman No. 41 filter paper. The filtrates were collected, made up to known volume and stored in refrigerator at 4 °C. The methanolic extracts were used for phytochemical and antibacterial studies. The preliminary phytochemical screening was performed according to the modified Harborne method. The methanolic flower extracts of B. floccifera Bedd. was tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the disc diffusion method.ResultsThe results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol, tannins, xanthoproteins, steroids, tannins, steroids, phytosterols, triterpenoids, sapogenins, coumarins and carbohydrates presence in the methanolic extracts of B. floccifera. The antibacterial activity has been observed in the methanolic extracts of B. floccifera against the tested bacteria with varied activity. The maximum zone of inhibition was 28 mm for Bacillus cereus, 25 mm for Staphylococcus aureus, 15 mm for Escherichia coli, 13 mm for Proteus mirabilis, 7 mm for Klebsiella pneumonia.ConclusionsThe antimicrobial activity of B. floccifera methanolic flower extracts are comparable and their potential as alternative in the treatment of infectious by these microorganisms.'], ['The northern part of West Bengal, India partially falls within the Terai region of Himalaya. This region is distinctive in terms of high forest cover and rich biodiversity, but also features increasing human population, agricultural practices, and subsequent human-wildlife conflict. This study evaluated the impact of anthropogenic and agricultural proliferation on land use and land cover (LULC) transition dynamics of a forest and its surrounding area of this region. Jaldapara National Park along with its neighbouring region represents an ideal example of such ecology and thus was chosen as the study area. Satellite remote sensing was used to overcome accessibility issues in areas of protected forest and model future possible LULC of the area. Results indicated a continuous decrease in dense forest from 1978 to 2016. Modelling predicted a continuation of the same trend through 2050. The total area under forest increased from 1978 to 2001, possibly due to declaration of a part of the forest as a wildlife sanctuary in 1976 and subsequent increase in supervision and surveillance. However, total forest area started to decline from 2001 and future reductions are possible. Cultivated lands increased from 1978 to 2016 and additional future increase is likely due to a commensurate surge in human population in areas adjacent to the forest. In sum, increasing population pressure, agricultural production demands, and high human intervention in forest ecology were identified as possible causes of temporal forest degradation.'], ['Lack of knowledge on forest structure, composition, and magnitude of human impact on various components of the ecosystem remain a major limitation for the development of appropriate participatory management programmes for conservation and sustainable utilisation of forests in Nepal. This study provides information on state of the resource base and effects of site characteristics and human activities on density, diversity and regeneration in Sal (Shorea robusta Gaertn.f.) and Mixed Broadleaved (MBL) forests in the central, lower Mid-Hills of Nepal. For trees with diameter ⩾10\\xa0cm the results are based on 72 square (20\\xa0×\\xa020\\xa0m) plots; for shrubs and herbs the material included 144 plots, nested within the 72 larger plots. Apart from vegetation data the material included information on human impacts, such as tree cutting, livestock grazing and lopping. The proportion of trees felled in Sal forest was observed to be up to 41%. The pressure on the vegetation also affected the regeneration of trees, shrubs and herbs. The density and basal area were moderate for all vegetation types, whereas the species diversity was higher than previously observed in other forests of Nepal. Among the species used by the ethnic group living in the study area, the Chepangs, only half (49.7%) were represented within the plots and the regeneration of such species was poor. Effects of altitude, aspect, grazing, crown cover and other factors on basal area and density of different vegetation strata was examined using general linear models. The results indicated significant human impact on the forest vegetation, both with respect to species diversity, density, distribution, and composition. Reduction of the densities of key livelihood species will affect the social and economic welfare of local people. Thus an improvement of forest management is urgent, because the forests need immediate recovery.'], ['Recent studies based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission suggested that groundwater has increased in central and southern parts of India. However, surface water, which is an equally important source of water in these semi-arid areas has not been studied yet. In the present study, the study areas were outlined based on trends in GRACE data followed by trend identification in surface water storages and checking the hypothesis of causality. Surface Water Extent (SWE) and Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) derived from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) respectively, are selected as proxies of surface water storage (SWS). Besides SWE and SSM, trend test was performed for GRACE derived terrestrial water storage (TWS) for the study areas named as R1, R2, GOR1 and KOR1. Granger-causality test is used to test the hypothesis that rainfall is a causal factor of the inter-annual variability of SWE, SSM and TWS. Positive trends were observed in TWS for R1, R2 and GOR1 whereas SWE and SSM show increasing trends for all the study regions. Results suggest that rainfall is the granger-causal of all the storage variables for R1 and R2, the regions exhibiting the most significant positive trends in TWS.'], [\"Catchment resources, generated from multi-source data (remotely-sensed, map- and ground-based systems), were input to a raster-based Geographical Information Systems (GIS) after geometrically co-registered to a standard grid (pixel). The GIS used was the PC-based, indigenously-developed package, called GRAM (Geo-Referenced Area Management). A set of knowledge-based rules, for assessing the soil erosion of this heterogeneous hilly catchment, were formulated from the knowledge of the multi-disciplinary resource-experts and the knowledge of the local catchment resources, in addition to the field observations. This rule-based model, which is hopefully fast and cost-effective and without effect of the individual bias, helped in inferring the erosion intensity units that most likely to occur at any given pixel in the system. Finally, the catchment was grouped into four different erosion intensity units namely very severe, severe, moderate to severe and slight to moderate. The quantitative soil loss (t ha−1 year−1) ranges, estimated by USLE model by a spatial information analysis approach (GIS), were also computed: (a) Very severe (>50): (b) Severe (40–50); (c) Moderate to severe (20–40); and (d) Slight to moderate (<20). An integrated priority delineation survey, for taking up soil/water conservation measures by Sediment Yield Index model, carried out in the catchment grouped the catchment into very high, high, medium and low priority classes. Apparently, the areal extent of high and moderate priority classes occupy about 80% of the catchment, which is closely following the areal extent of severe and moderate to severe erosion intensity unit categories by this rule-based model. The outcome of the results of this study will be immensely useful to monitor the dynamic changes in the catchment environment. The soil erosion information system thus generated, identifies the targeted problem areas for conservation planning and sustainable development of the catchment. Although it is an early airing of results obtained from this rule-based model, the introduction of multi-disciplinary expert's informed opinion may provide an extension to the traditional methods of assessing the soil erosion status/magnitude which should enable and/or evaluate different catchment management scenarios.\"], ['Aim of studyIndia has great biodiversity of fauna. The use of fauna with medicinal properties is a common practice since pre-hispanic times. In the last decade, there has been an interest in ethnozoological studies in India. Ethnozoological studies are necessary in order to discover new medications for human health. There is urgency in recording such data. This is the first ethnozoological study in which statistical calculations about animals are done by the ICF method in Kerala, India. The purpose of this study is to analyze and record traditional knowledge of animals utilized by the indigenous people living on Silent Valley, located in Palakkad district of Kerala, India and to document the traditional names, preparation and uses of these animals.Materials and methodsField study was carried out for a period of September 2011 to August 2012 years in Kerala. The ethnomedicinal information was collected through interviews, informal meetings, open and group discussions and overt observations with semi-structured questionnaires among traditional healers. The collected data were analyzed through informant consensus factor (ICF) and fidelity level (FL).ResultsThis study recorded a total of 57 families, 66 genera, and 69 species of animals that produced 163 methods for usages. Mammalian occupied 29% of the total animals listed, followed by aves (28%), insects (17%), reptiles (10%), actinopterygii (4%), malacostraca, amphibians and clitellata (each 3%), chilopoda (2%) and gastropoda (1%) of the whole, respectively. In regards to usage, 68 species utilized as food products and medicinal uses, totaled 98.55% followed by one species for cosmetics (1.45%).ConclusionThis study indicated that the animals are still being used by the local healers of Palakkad district, to treat various illnesses. The empirical knowledge reported in this study will provide outstanding possibilities for the discovery of new sources of medicine for the drug industry.'], ['Systematic notions of significant human impacts on regional and global climate change and species extinctions developed first in the French and British colonial empires. Building on classical Greek theories linking deforestation to rainfall decline the colonial climatic theorists were stimulated by the Newtonian thinking of Stepben Hales and his disciples. The new climate theories led to pioneering forest protection schemes in Tobago, St Vincent, St Helena, Mauritius and western India where the East India Company actively promoted conservation. The Royal Society of Arts, the Academie des Sciences and the Royal Geographical Society all acted as institutional mechanisms for encouraging forest protection based on fears of climate change, long before early environmentalism developed in the United States.'], ['Tropical dry evergreen forests (TDEF) are a unique forest type found along the east coast of India. They mostly occur as small, isolated fragments of varying sizes (0.5 to ≈10\\xa0ha) and are considered as endangered forests types in peninsular India. Although plant diversity is well documented in these forests, there is a paucity of ecological studies vital for conservation and for planning restoration activities. We studied reproductive biology of 13 woody species: four trees, six shrubs, and three lianas in fragments of TDEF in southern India. The phenology of reproduction, floral biology, anthesis and sexual system of each species were recorded. The pollination mode was assessed through observations of the visitation frequency of pollinators and from the floral characters. The breeding system was determined by hand-augmented self- and cross-pollination experiments. The plants flowered during the dry season from January to July. Plants of nine species had both flowers and fruits at the same time. Twelve species were hermaphrodites and one was polygamo-dioecious. Flowers of 11 species opened at dawn and two at dusk. Four species were self-incompatible and six were self-compatible. Natural fruit set ranged from 10% to 56%, self-incompatible species having low fruit set. Cross-pollen augmentation increased fruit set, suggesting presence of outcrossing in all species. The majority of plants species (85%) had a generalized pollination system, receiving visits from diverse insects, such as social bees, solitary bees, wasps, moths and flies. However, only few of them were functionally important for the species. Two species namely: Capparis brevispina and C. zeylanica had butterflies and birds, respectively, as their main pollinators. Our data reveal that there is a predominance of outcrossing in plant species and a generalized pollination system in these forests. We suggest that restoration of TDEFs is crucial as habitats, not only for wild plants but also for pollinating insects.'], ['Ethnopharmacological relevanceAlthough many plants are claimed to possess anticonvulsant/antiepileptic (AC/AE) properties, but there is very little information available about plants used by various ethnic communities in different parts of India to treat epilepsy, one of the most common disorders of central nervous system (CNS); this communication provides significant ethnomedicinal information on the plants used by indigenous communities: Bhoxa, Tharu and nomadic Gujjars of sub-Himalayan region, Uttarakhand, India to treat epilepsy, so that it could be used as a baseline data for studying chemical constituents and biological activities of these promising plants.Aims of the studyTo record herbal preparations used by the presently studied communities for treating epilepsy and discuss AC/AE properties of the recorded plants.Research strategy and methodsNinety one traditional healers (29 Bhoxa, 35 Tharu and 27 nomadic Gujjars) in sub-Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, India were interviewed to collect information on herbal preparations used by them for treating epilepsy. For each recorded species the use value (UV) and fidelity level (FL) was calculated.ResultsA total of 24 plants belonging to 24 genera and 22 families were used by the presently studied communities in 26 formulations to treat epilepsy. According to FL and UV values, most preferred species for the treatment of epilepsy by Bhoxa community are Ricinus communis L. and Datura stramonium L.; by nomadic Gujjar community are Martynia annua L., Bacopa monnieri (L.) Wettst. and Ricinus communis L.; and by Tharu community are Allium sativum L., Asparagus racemosus Willd. and Achyranthes aspera L. Eight plants viz., Allium sativum L., Boerhavia diffusa L., Cassia fistula L., Clerodendrum viscosum Vent., Datura stramonium L., Inula cappa DC., Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz and Pavetta indica L. recorded in the present survey have been reported for the first time in treatment of epilepsy by these indigenous communities in India. Five out of these eight newly reported plants viz., Cassia fistula L., Clerodendrum viscosum Vent., Inula cappa DC., Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz and Pavetta indica L. have not been pharmacologically evaluated yet for their possible AC/AE properties.ConclusionsDetailed research on the listed plants and their derivatives may be undertaken to provide new alternative treatments and therapeutic uses for epilepsy or other diseases of CNS.

Across all study sites, 5,995 trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥10\\xa0cm, comprising 79 species from 38 families, were analysed. Tree species of the Dipterocarpaceae were most common (10 species), followed by the species of Caesalpinaceae, Combretaceae and Ebenaceae. Analysis of relative carbon stocks (RCS) suggested that Lagerstroemia calyculata Kurz (RCS=14.3%), Syzygium sp.

This study presents a numerical and cartographic evaluation of these no-analogue climatic zones, whose consequences for existing ecosystems are quite unpredictable, using a method based on the convex hull in a climate hyperspace and 12 future climate projections for 2080. The percentage of the world surface that will foreseeably be occupied by no-analogue climates by 2080 ranges between 3.5% and 17.5%.

In India, about 5330 million tones (16.4\\xa0t/ha) of soil is being lost every year. Conventional methods of bench terracing coupled with dry rubble packed bunds are being used on steep slopes of plantation area situated along the Western Ghats, to reduce surface erosion. But these conventional methods prove unsuitable in many of the steep slopes which are highly susceptible to erosion. A permanent and self-propagating vegetal cover is found to be an ideal solution to 90% of the erosion problems. Stabilisation of soil along the hill slopes using natural and locally available materials such as coir is a recent technique. Natural and biodegradable fibres such as coir and jute in the form of nettings can aid in vegetative turfing along the slopes. These nettings are intended to protect the seeds and the soil until the sites are permanently stabilised with vegetal cover, by providing a physical barrier between the soil particles and rainwater. The coir netting spread over seeded slopes shields the soil and seeds from the impact of rain drops, minimise runoff and slows down its velocity, maintains the capacity of soil to absorb water, holds the soil particles and seeds in place and retains soil moisture. When seeds germinate, they grow through the gaps in the fabric and achieve a cover all over as the biodegradable coir netting begins to degrade. This technology is applicable to highly erodable slopes where mechanical methods such as tillage or terracing prove unsuitable. This paper presents the methodology followed in monitoring soil erosion in a hill slope stabilised by coir geotextile aided vegetative turfing. Improvement in various soil parameters in such a protected slope is analysed by a comparison of results from a similar unprotected slope.'], ['Quantifying the magnitude of human-induced biodiversity loss is a critical yet daunting challenge. Recently, species extinction rate estimates using island biogeography theory have once again been called into question. Here we highlight two of the many factors making the traditional application of this approach problematic for measuring biodiversity loss: first, the extreme assumption that native habitats are surrounded by a sea of human enterprise largely incapable of sustaining native biodiversity and, second, the sole use of species-level extinction estimates, which always underestimates the loss of biodiversity. Here we show that a wide array of taxa make human-dominated, farming countryside their home beyond the borders of native habitats. With data on native tropical birds, we show how simple species numeration masks dramatic differences between habitat types in community composition (e.g. species diversity or functional diversity). Overlooking the countryside biota, coupled with a scientific paradigm that underestimates biodiversity loss by equating it with species extinction, will only exacerbate the ongoing crisis. This is especially true given the rapid expansion and intensification of agriculture threatening countryside biotas, and a persistent limited understanding of how population extinctions and changes in community composition alter ecosystem functioning and services that support human life and wellbeing.'], ['Hedychium coronarium (Zingiberaceae) is a perennial rhizomatous herb widely used for its aromatic, cosmetic and medicinal value. In the present research, the morphological, phytochemical and molecular diversity was assessed for 50 H. coronarium accessions collected from different states of Eastern India. The accessions were morphologically diverse with leaf number, leaf length, leaf width, rhizome diameter and rhizome dry weight characters showing the highest variation. A total of 44 constituents were identified in the essential oils with β-pinene (11.87–35.16%), eucalyptol (13.12–39.82%), linalool (1.58–41.33%) and coronarin-E (1.14–33.87%) as the predominant constituents. Using 10 Inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) and 5 Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers, a total of 71 and 34 bands were amplified, respectively. The average polymorphism, polymorphic information content, marker index were found to be 86.30%, 0.57, 3.26 and 87.58%, 0.55, 3.01 for ISSR and RAPD markers, respectively. Cluster analysis based on phytochemical and molecular characterization exhibited a clear relationship between diversity pattern and geographical origin. The percentage of variance explained using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was 70.31% and 71.91% for ISSR and RAPD markers, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) analysis revealed high genetic variability occurred among the population than within populations. Bayesian analytical model and cluster analysis showed similar grouping patterns. The findings of the present research revealed a high degree of molecular and phytochemical variation among H. coronarium populations in relation to geographic locations.

Remote sensing is one of the most powerful approaches to identify biodiversity hotspots and predict changes in species composition in reduced time and costs. This is because, with respect to field-based methods, it allows to derive complete spatial coverages of the Earth surface under study in a short period of time. Furthermore, remote sensing provides repeated coverages of field sites, thus making studies of temporal changes in biodiversity possible. In this paper we discuss, from a conceptual point of view, the potential of remote sensing in estimating biodiversity using various diversity indices, including alpha- and beta-diversity measurements.'], ['Representations of land use change in hydrologic impact assessment studies mostly rely on static land use information of two points in time, even though the availability of dense time series of land use data allows for the incorporation of dynamic land use changes. We compare the hydrologic impacts of dynamic land use change assessments to those of static land use change assessments. These effects are illustrated with the help of two land use scenarios applied to a hydrologic model of a rapidly developing meso-scale (2036\\xa0km2) catchment upstream of Pune, India. The results show that a linear dynamic land use development could be better approximated with the static approach than a non-linear development. An analysis of the impact of the frequency of land use updates indicates that the prediction of non-linear land use change impacts already improves substantially when frequent land use information every five to nine years is used.'], ['Long term forest research sites in India, going by different names including Linear Tree Increment Plots, Linear Increment Plots, Linear Sample Plots and Permanent Preservation Plots, cover diverse plant communities and environmental conditions. Presently, some of these long-term observational studies are functional, some are disturbed and others have almost been lost. The accumulated data will become increasingly important in the context of environmental modelling and climate change, especially if the plots and data can be maintained and/or revived. This contribution presents the history and current state of forest research plots in India, including details of locations and re-measurements. We provide a brief introduction of the National Forest Inventory (NFI), Preservation Plots in natural forests, the 50-ha Mudumalai Forest Dynamics Plot as part of the Centre for Tropical Forest Science and Smithsonian Institution Global Earth Observatories network (CTFS–SIGEO), and research plots established in plantations for tree growth studies and modelling. We also present some methodological details including assessment and analysis for two types of observational studies, the Tree Count Plots (TCP) and Tree Re-measurement Plots (TRP). Arguments are presented in favour of enumeration and analysis methods which are consistent with current approaches in forest ecological research.'], ['Understanding how and why diversification rates vary across evolutionary time is central to understanding how biodiversity is generated and maintained. Recent mathematical models that allow estimation of diversification rates across time from reconstructed phylogenies have enabled us to make inferences on how biodiversity copes with environmental change. Here, we explore patterns of temporal diversification in Uropeltidae, a diverse fossorial snake family. We generate a time-calibrated phylogenetic hypothesis for Uropeltidae and show a significant correlation between diversification rate and paleotemperature during the Cenozoic. We show that the temporal diversification pattern of this group is punctuated by one rate shift event with a decrease in diversification and turnover rate between ca. 11\\xa0Ma to present, but there is no strong support for mass extinction events. The analysis indicates higher turnover during periods of drastic climatic fluctuations and reduced diversification rates associated with contraction and fragmentation of forest habitats during the late Miocene. Our study highlights the influence of environmental fluctuations on diversification rates in fossorial taxa such as uropeltids, and raises conservation concerns related to present rate of climate change.'], [\"Study regionIndia.Study focusIndia's groundwater dependence and the crises of depletion and contamination of groundwater resources require the development of a robust groundwater dependence framework. Understanding the challenges of developing a groundwater governance framework for regions of extensive groundwater development versus relatively less-developed areas of groundwater development is important. The groundwater typology is a function of both, the hydrogeological aspects of groundwater and the socio-economic milieu that defines dependency on the groundwater resource, which is significant across users and uses in India. An interdisciplinary perspective is important while managing groundwater resources in India and helping establish groundwater governance.New hydrological insights for the regionParticipatory forms of groundwater management, using ‘aquifer-based, common pool resource’ approaches have begun to find their way into the practices and policies dealing with groundwater in India. Participation at all levels is important in management decisions as well as in the development of a governance framework, knowing that groundwater development in India has been ‘atomistic’ in nature. Developing a regulatory framework that is supportive of ‘protection’ of the resource as well as ‘good practices of participatory groundwater management’ is essential in groundwater governance. Interdisciplinary ‘science’ must form the medium of promoting both groundwater management and governance instead of using it in the largely business-as-usual approach to groundwater resource management that remains ‘infrastructure’ based, ‘supply-side’.\"], [\"India ranks first in rainfed agriculture globally in both area (86\\xa0Mha) and the value of produce. Rainfed regions in India contribute substantially toward food grain production including 44% of rice, 87% of coarse cereals (sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), maize (Zea mays)), and 85% of food legumes, 72% of oilseeds, 65% of cotton, and 90% of minor millets. Overall, the rainfed areas produce 40% of the food grains, support two-thirds of the livestock population, and are critical to food security, equity, and sustainability.India is home to 18% of world's population, 15% of the world livestock, 4.2% of fresh water resources, 1% of forests, and 0.5% of pasture land, but only has 2.3% of the geographical area. India is home to 25% of the world's hungry population of ∼1 billion along with an estimated 43% of children malnourished under the age of five. The net sown area in India has remained constant for several years at 141\\xa0Mha, but the human and livestock populations have been steadily increasing. Though the Indian population increased from 361 million in 1951 to 1140 million in 2011, tripling over 60\\xa0years, the food-grain production has more than quadrupled, but the yield gains are largely from the irrigated agroecosystems. Notwithstanding the increase in average productivity from 0.6\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1 in the 1980s to 1.1\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1 at the present time, large yield gaps exist for rainfed crops in the semiarid regions. Even after realizing the full irrigation potential, nearly 40% of the net sown area of 141\\xa0Mha will remain totally rainfed. The per capita availability of land has fallen drastically from 2.4\\xa0ha in 1951 to about 0.32\\xa0ha in 2001; and it is projected to decline further to 0.09\\xa0ha by 2050. Increasing productivity of rainfed cropping systems is of critical importance to meet the food demands of an ever-increasing population in India.The potential productivity of maize (Z. mays) in high rainfall regions under rainfed condition is 8.0\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1 vis-a-vis the national average yield of 2.1\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1, indicating an unbridged yield gap of ∼6\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1. Large yield gaps exist in other crops as well which are primarily grown under rainfed conditions. Recommended management practices (RMPs) such as improved cultivars, site specific nutrient management (precision agriculture), and water harvesting and recycling can potentially increase the yields in several crops up to 6\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1, indicating the large realizable potential under rainfed conditions. There are many districts in India where the actual yields are much lower than the national average, and there is enormous potential for improvement. The objective of this article is to discuss the production potentials and the yield gaps of predominant crops grown under rainfed conditions in India, biotic and abiotic constraints, and RMPs for realizing the potentials.\"], ['Energy is a vital component of any society playing a pivotal role in the development. Post oil crises shifted the focus of energy planners towards renewable resources and energy conservation. Biomass is one such renewable, which accounts for nearly 33% of a developing country’s energy needs. In India, it meets about 75% of the rural energy needs. In Karnataka, non-commercial energy sources like firewood, agricultural residues, charcoal and cow dung account for 53.2%. The energy released by the reaction of organic carbon (of bioresources) with oxygen is referred to as bioenergy. Bioresource availability is highly diversified and it depends on the region’s agroclimatic conditions. Inventorying of these resources is required for describing the quality, quantity, change, productivity, condition of bioresources and requirement in a given area. The present study assesses bioresource status across the agroclimatic zones of Karnataka, considering the bioenergy availability (from agriculture, horticulture, forests and plantations) and sector-wise energy demand (domestic, agriculture, industry, etc.).Bioresource availability is computed based on the compilation of data on the area and productivity of agriculture and horticulture crops, forests and plantations. Sector-wise energy demand is computed based on the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO study) data, primary survey data and from the literature. Using the data of bioresource availability and demand, bioresource status is computed for all the agroclimatic zones. The ratio of bioresource availability to demand gives the bioresource status. The ratio greater than one indicates bioresource surplus zones, while a ratio less than one indicates scarcity.The study reveals that the central dry zone (1.4), the hilly zone (3.79), the southern transition zone (3.12) and the coastal zone (3.40) are bioresource surplus zones, whereas the northeastern transition zone (0.48), northeastern dry zone (0.23), northern dry zone (0.58), eastern dry zone (0.39), southern dry zone (0.93) and northern transition zone (0.45) come under bioresource-deficient zones. Among the bioresource surplus zones, horticulture residues contribute significantly towards bioenergy in the central dry zone, southern transition zone and the coastal zone, while in the hilly zone the main contributor of bioenergy are agricultural residues. Amidst the bioresource-deficient zones, agriculture is the major contributor of bioenergy in the northeastern transition zone (52%), northern dry zone (59%), and northern transition zone. Based on the bioenergy status of the zones and land use pattern, feasible management and technical options have been discussed, which help in optimising the available bioenergy and in building a sustainable energy society. This study also explores various programmes that can be initiated and implemented like social, community and joint forest management involving public participation. Such schemes will lessen the burden on the existing resources and also help the rural masses to procure biomass on a sustained basis.'], [\"Joint Forest Management (JFM), embracing the philosophy of forest conservation and livelihood improvement through cooperation between state and civil society, has emerged over the past decades both as a specific paradigm of forest governance in India and as India's largest community forestry program. The JFM program, evolved during early 1970s covering a few forest villages as a model for reversing the trend of degraded forest ecosystem through the active protection by local villagers. The JFM program is implemented currently by 106,482 Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMC) and it covers 22 million ha of forests spread across 28 constituent states of India and union territories.JFM emerged against a backdrop of two centuries of centralised bureaucratic control over forest management in India. Centralized control during the 19th and 20th centuries failed either to conserve resources or to contribute substantially to the well-being of local populations. However, inconsistent persuasions from decentralization policies in India under present forest policy (1988) have prompted people to analyse the theoretical basis for accepting that decentralization would bring improvements in forest ecosystem management. Still others have contested the de facto rationale for decentralization (i.e., improved forest management) and have suggested that decentralization may be a manipulation by elites to serve their own interests or to shift power, for example from national to international agencies that have funded decentralization. Thirty years from its inception, there are now concerns for the recent effectiveness of JFM (over the past 20 years) because it is a group action that is getting old and is perhaps losing some of its pioneering drive and innovativeness.Although JFM has been administered nationally, decisions on implementation detail have been left to the individual states, resulting in different strategies. The long history of JFM has also provided scope for experiences with it to change over time as well as between places.Given the range of experiences with and perceptions of JFM, as well as the importance of the objectives JFM ostensibly serves, the time is ripe therefore for a retrospective evaluation to take stock of its actual achievements, its status and ways forward. The current paper seeks to provide such a review and analysis.The paper highlights design and implementation issues related to government resolutions, benefits-sharing and forest offences. It also assesses the critical design factors and key drivers responsible for institutional reforms. The paper evaluates impacts of protection on forest productivity and on the livelihoods of local communities. It highlights that the JFM program, by virtue of the diversity of its implementation, provides an ideal laboratory for exploring why similar reforms can lead to different outcomes. The paper argued that though there are supporting government policy and guideline and massive fund support, why there has been a low down of enthusiasm for JFM in the last two decades. From experiences, it suggests strategies for its revival and JFM can further contribute effective toward forest conservation and enhanced livelihood opportunities in the future.\"], ['Tropical and subtropical islands benefit from a wide spectrum of renewable energy resources and advancement in technology has made it feasible for harnessing these clean and abundant energy sources. Mauritius being located in the tropical belt, receives plenteous sunshine all year round. Consequently, to provide assistance to the Government and other relevant organizations wishing to deploy photovoltaic facilities on the island, the methodological framework and results presented have been organized to serve as a strong background to identify the optimum sites for efficient harnessing of solar energy through photovoltaic systems. The Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) analysis coupled to Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) have been used to model the solar photovoltaic potential of the island from a set of social, technical, legal, environmental and climatological factors. The performance of the model has been calibrated using the monthly fluctuations in electricity production from a photovoltaic power plant located on the island. We propose an adapted mathematical formula to theoretically estimate the electricity production from photovoltaic systems on the island on the temporal basis. The outcome of this research is the production of a high resolution yearly mean solar photovoltaic map alongside with the spatio-temporal variability of photovoltaic potential throughout the year.'], ['This study examined the use of Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) to effectively manage fishing impacts on all ecosystem components, as required under Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management (EBFM) principles. A consequence of changing from input controls to output-based (catch) management is that the control of the regulating authority tends to be reduced, which may affect the outcomes for ecosystem management. This study reviewed the use of input controls across six fishing methods in 18 ITQ fisheries, which have been independently accredited as ecologically sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council (12 fisheries) or under Australian environmental legislation for Wildlife Trade Operation (six fisheries). Input controls were retained across a range of ITQ fisheries, with non-selective fisheries such as trawl, gillnet and line employing more input controls than selective fisheries such as purse-seine, pot/trap and dredge. Further case-studies confirmed the widespread and recent use of input controls (spatial and temporal closures) with the aim of managing ecosystem impacts of fishing. The retention of input controls, particularly closures affects the security (quality of title) characteristic of the fishing use right and the theoretical ability of fishers to manage their right for their future benefit. The security characteristic is weakened by closures through loss of access, which undermines industry trust and incentive for long-term decision making. By reducing the security of ITQs, individual fisher incentives and behaviour may separate from societal objectives for sustainability, which was one of the foremost reasons for introducing ITQ management.'], ['Many invasive alien species (IAS) are used by local communities for a variety of subsistence and income generating purposes. This frequently poses a conflict of interest for their removal due to forest conservation and biodiversity concerns. However, if local use can simultaneously check or control specific IAS, the conflict can be avoided and both development and forest conservation perspectives accommodated in the short to medium term. We examine this for Lantana camara invasion in southern India through assessment of the demand for and impacts of harvesting on this globally problematic IAS. We interviewed local artisans regarding their knowledge and quantities of Lantana used, along with forest surveys to estimate Lantana densities and size classes in harvested and unharvested sites, and lastly we undertook controlled cutting in moist and dry deciduous forests in both the wet and dry seasons to examine rate of regrowth and mortality. Over the entire study area the abundance of Lantana far outweighed local demand, but at small scales around villages, density and size classes were significantly reduced through harvesting. The controlled cutting experiment showed marked seasonal differences, with the most severe cutting intensity resulting in significant mortality when Lantana plants were cut in the wet season, but with limited effect when cut in the dry season. We conclude that promoting local use of IAS may be a feasible approach in controlling them and thereby limiting their impacts in forests.'], ['This essay examines the presence of Yamuna in the city of Delhi, from two perspectives: (i) understanding riverscapes as simultaneously aquatic and terrestrial and (ii) understanding these as conjoining issues of environment and technology. With events over the course of the last century as its backdrop, the essay focuses on the last few decades of the twentieth century, to examine the relation of land and river in Delhi; the interface of people and projects, especially the issue of slums; and the risks posed to the river on account of waste and pollution. All these featured prominently in the events leading up to the staging of the Commonwealth Games in Delhi in October 2010, which provides the most immediate context for this essay.

(family – Hippocrateaceae) is a convenient source for industrial scale isolation of antidiabetic and anticancerous drug ‘mangiferin’ which is extensively used in both traditional and modern medicines. High demands from pharmaceutical industries lead the indiscriminate harvesting from the wild which created the pressure on natural populations. Micropropagation system was developed using different explants for both commercialization and conservation of S. chinensis. Murashige and Skoog’s (MS) medium with different concentrations and combinations of plant growth regulators (PGRs) viz. 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), kinetin (KN), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) were used during various in vitro regeneration stages. Maximum rate of shoot multiplication (75%) and maximum number of shoots (6.7\\xa0±\\xa01.0) were obtained with MS medium fortified with BAP (2.0\\xa0mg/l), NAA (0.8\\xa0mg/l) and ascorbic acid (100\\xa0mg/l). The antioxidants and other additives significantly altered the rate of shoot multiplication, number of shoots as well as survival rate of shoots. The plantlets rooted on ½MS\\xa0+\\xa0IBA 1.5\\xa0mg/l, showed 80% establishment in soil without any morphological variation. The genetic integrity of the regenerated plants was further confirmed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) analysis. A total of 3871 distinct bands were produced by 12 RAPD and 17 ISSR primers in mother and 20 randomly selected micropropagated clones wherein 3858 (99.66%) bands were monomorphic and rest of 13 (0.34%) were polymorphic. The high level of monomorphism confirms the genetic uniformity of the micropropagated clones. Additionally, reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) analysis at various in vitro regeneration stages showed uniformity in terms of presence of mangiferin however, the amount of mangiferin varied across regeneration stages. Phytochemical and molecular fingerprinting of micropropagated clones revealed that the in vitro regeneration protocol developed could be successfully used for industrial-scale propagation of S. chinensis with enhanced production of mangiferin.'], ['Projected droughts for 21st century over India have been analysed using precipitation and temperature data obtained from Regional Climate Models (RCMs) under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized effective Precipitation Evapo-Transpiration Index (SP*ETI) and Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at the timescale of 12-months have been used for drought characterization. The K-means clustering algorithm has been utilized to delineate distinct drought homogeneous regions in India. Trends and periodicities in drought characteristics have also been analysed. The results of this study reveal that increase in evapotranspiration due to projected rise in temperature would play a major role in affecting future drought dynamics in most parts of India. Analysis indicates that computed magnitude of drought intensity, duration and frequency depends on the choice of drought indicator. SPEI drought index has been found to project highest drought risk as compared to other two indices used in this study. North India is more vulnerable to increase in drought severity and frequency in near future. However in far future, most parts of the country, except few southeastern states, are likely to face an escalation in drought severity and frequency. A shift in drought hazard from central India toward southeast-central India is likely to happen with increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration. The areal extent of droughts has been found to be increasing historically which is expected to increase further in future for most parts of the country. Historically, drought dynamics were more influenced by decrease in precipitation. However, in future, the drought dynamics will be significantly influenced by increased evapotranspiration resulting from increase in temperature in spite of likely increase in precipitation. The periodicity analysis indicates inter-annual periodicities influencing monsoon months to be distributed uniformly across all clusters of the Indian subcontinent with dominant cycles of 2–3.6\\u202fyears. Further, change in periodic cycles of drought due to climate change is found to be insignificant.'], ['Memecylon subcordatum (Melastomataceae) is an endemic and critically endangered species of the Kalakkad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in India. Twenty five inter-simple sequence repeat primers were used to screen 86 individuals. Nine primers produced a total of 61 bands (6.77 bands primer−1) ranging from 200 to 1900 bp wherein 48 bands were of polymorphic. Polymorphism was 78.69% within the species, 26.60% within the populations and 7.41%–48.15% among the populations. Genetic variation varied from 0.3069 (within species) to 0.1182 (within populations). The poor gene flow among the populations (Nm: 0.3133) could be due to the genetic barriers caused by the tributaries of Tambraparani river. The coefficient of genetic differentiation between the populations (GST) was 0.6148. The Bayesian analysis, multidimensional scaling analysis and principal coordinates analysis grouped all the 11 populations under 4 clades.

Present study investigates the long-term changes in streamflows, their quantitative attribution and socio-environmental implications for a climatically sensitive Tapi basin in west central India. The abrupt and gradual changes in streamflows have been detected over the period 1973–2013 using non-parametric Pettit's and Mann-Whitney U tests; and Modified Mann-Kendall, Spearman's Rho and Sen's slope estimator tests respectively. The streamflow analyses revealed heterogeneity across the basin, wherein the tributaries exhibited higher variability in annual runoff compared to the Tapi River. The spatial analyst tool of ArcGIS has been used to graphically demonstrate the spatial variability in rainfall and streamflow trends across the basin. The streamflows exhibited predominantly decreasing trends across the basin, except in the upper reaches of the Tapi River. The decreasing trends in streamflow are largely attributed to anthropogenic activities such as changes in the land use patterns viz., increase in agriculture area, construction of minor and medium hydraulic structures, decrease in forest cover, rapid urbanization, excessive groundwater extraction and streamflow regulations. The anthropogenic activities played a major role in declining streamflow trends in the Tapi basin, contributing about 68%–99% (average 85%) decline in total runoff, compared to rainfall variability, which contributed around 1%–32% (average 15%) decrease in total runoff. The analysis of water stress levels at sub-catchment scale exhibited significant rise in percentage of population living in the basin facing chronic water shortage (i.e., <1000\\u202fm3/capita/year), from 34.0% in year 1981 to 63.2% in year 2011, mostly in semi-arid regions.

Changes in forest cover in tropical regions take many different forms and result in multi-dimensional changes in watershed processes: soil erosion rates, peak and low-flow levels, groundwater recharge rates, and water quality. These changes are in turn mediated by the socio-technical context to create a variety of context-specific human impacts, which constitute watershed ‘services’ (or ‘dis-services’). Over the past decade, understanding of the biophysical linkage has generally become nuanced. But large gaps remain in regions like south Asia and Africa and on the question of how different types of forest transitions affect low flows, and the socio-hydrological links are inadequately studied.

Along the climosequence, the current mean annual rainfall (MAR) varies within a 80\\xa0km transect from 6000\\xa0mm at the edge of the Plateau to 500\\xa0mm inland. Pedogenic carbonates occur in the MAR range of 500–1200\\xa0mm. In the semi-arid zone (MAR: 500–900\\xa0mm), carbonates occur (i) as thick hardpan calcretes on pediment slopes and (ii) as nodular horizons in polygenic black soils (i.e. vertisols). In the sub-humid zone (MAR: 900–1500\\xa0mm), pedogenic carbonates are disseminated in the black soil matrices either as loose, irregular and friable nodules of millimetric size or as indurated botryoidal nodules of centimetric to pluricentimetric size. They also occur at the top layers of the saprolite either as disseminated pluricentimetric indurated nodules or carbonate-cemented lumps of centimetric to decimetric size.Chemical and isotopic (87Sr/86Sr) compositions of the carbonate fraction were determined after leaching with 0.25\\xa0N HCl. The corresponding residual fractions containing both primary minerals and authigenic clays were digested separately and analyzed. The trend defined by the 87Sr/86Sr signatures of both labile carbonate fractions and corresponding residual fractions indicates that a part of the labile carbonate fraction is genetically linked to the local soil composition. Considering the residual fraction of each sample as the most likely lithogenic source of Ca in carbonates, it is estimated that from 24% to 82% (55% on average) of Ca is derived from local bedrock weathering, leading to a consumption of an equivalent proportion of atmospheric CO2. These values indicate that climatic conditions were humid enough to allow silicate weathering: MAR at the time of carbonate formation likely ranged from 400 to 700\\xa0mm, which is 2- to 3-fold less than the current MAR at these locations.The Sr, U and Mg contents and the (234U/238U) activity ratio in the labile carbonate fraction help to understand the conditions of carbonate formation. The relatively high concentrations of Sr, U and Mg in black soil carbonates may indicate fast growth and accumulation compared to carbonates in saprolite, possibly due to a better confinement of the pore waters which is supported by their high (234U/238U) signatures, and/or to higher content of dissolved carbonates in the pore waters. The occurrence of Ce, Mn and Fe oxides in the cracks of carbonate reflects the existence of relatively humid periods after carbonate formation. The carbonate ages determined by the U–Th method range from 1.33\\xa0±\\xa00.84\\xa0kyr to 7.5\\xa0±\\xa02.7\\xa0kyr and to a cluster of five ages around 20\\xa0kyr, i.e. the Last Glacial Maximum period. The young occurrences are only located in the black soils, which therefore constitute sensitive environments for trapping and retaining atmospheric CO2 even on short time scales. The maximum age of carbonates depends on their location in the climatic gradient: from about 20\\xa0kyr for centimetric nodules at Mule Hole (MAR\\xa0=\\xa01100\\xa0mm/yr) to 200\\xa0kyr for the calcrete at Gundlupet (MAR\\xa0=\\xa0700\\xa0mm/yr, Durand et al., 2007). The intensity of rainfall during wet periods would indeed control the lifetime of pedogenic carbonates and thus the duration of inorganic carbon storage in soils.'], ['This article contributes to the diversity and stand structure of the mangroves in Kerala, India, using multivariate methods.

Hence, there is an urgent need for rapid assessment and monitoring of biodiversity on priority using state-of-art tools and technologies. The main purpose of this research article is to develop and implement a new methodological approach to characterize biological diversity using spatial model developed during the study viz. Spatial Biodiversity Model (SBM). The developed model is scale, resolution and location independent solution for spatial biodiversity richness modelling. The platform-independent computation model is based on parallel computation. The biodiversity model based on open-source software has been implemented on R statistical computing platform. It provides information on high disturbance and high biological richness areas through different landscape indices and site specific information (e.g. forest fragmentation (FR), disturbance index (DI) etc.). The model has been developed based on the case study of Indian landscape; however it can be implemented in any part of the world. As a case study, SBM has been tested for Uttarakhand state in India. Inputs for landscape ecology are derived through multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques in an interactive command line environment.

The first objective of the present study was to design a standardized protocol for in vitro regeneration of S. candicans from leaf explants and compare the antioxidant activities of aqueous extracts of in vitro calluses and in vivo leaves by three different methods. Callus was initiated on Murashige and Skoog's (MS) basal media supplemented with various concentrations (0.5\\xa0mg\\xa0L−\\xa01 to 2.0\\xa0mg\\xa0L−\\xa01) and combinations of auxins and cytokinins under dark incubation for 2\\xa0weeks. The percentage of callus induction (PCI) and the fresh weights were recorded after 28\\xa0days of culture. The fresh weights were again recorded after 4\\xa0weeks of sub-culture to determine the relative fresh weight growth (RFWG). The highest PCI of 87% and RFWG of 3.245 were obtained on an MS medium supplemented with 6-benzyl amino purine (BA) 2\\xa0mg\\xa0L−\\xa01 and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) 2\\xa0mg\\xa0L−\\xa01. The callus obtained after 28\\xa0days of culture were inoculated on MS medium supplemented with different growth regulators. The maximum average shoot length (4.28\\xa0±\\xa00.27\\xa0cm) and maximum percentage of shoot induction (81%) was observed on MS medium supplemented with BA (2.0\\xa0mg\\xa0L−\\xa01)\\xa0+\\xa0IAA (1.0\\xa0mg\\xa0L−\\xa01). The maximum root induction percentage (90%) from shoots was observed on half strength MS medium fortified with 3.0\\xa0mg\\xa0L−\\xa01 α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) alone. The antioxidant activity of in vivo leaf was significantly high compared to the in vitro callus in all the three antioxidant assays. A linear correlation between antioxidant activity and the total phenolic content was observed. The current protocol for in vitro regeneration would pave the way for further research on the isolation of bioactive compounds including antioxidants by cell suspension culture.\"], ['Rehabilitation of degraded lands needs appropriate mix of land use and erosion control measures, and is often associated with carbon (C) sequestration in the soil profile. However, topographic attributes play a deterministic role in the rate of C accretion in degraded sloping lands. This study was carried out to assess the effect of slope aspect on soil C sequestration, soil aggregation and soil moisture retention in aggradation phase of a denuded land in eastern India. Eight treatments of horti-silvi-pastural system integrated with in-situ moisture conservation were taken in randomized block design during 2000 to 2006. Indigofera teysmanni was taken as the silviculture component and hedgerows of the species were used uniformly for all the treatments. A significant interaction effect of the rehabilitation system and slope aspect was observed for residual soil moisture content, soil organic C (SOC) content, SOC stock, size distribution of aggregates and C content in aggregate fractions. Treatments with trenches of 0.45\\xa0×\\xa00.45\\xa0×\\xa01.0\\xa0m dimension at 0.5\\xa0m\\xa0u/s of fruit plants conserved significantly higher soil moisture even at 87\\xa0mm of evaporativity. On an average, the north facing (NF) aspect had 1.13 and 0.75\\xa0g 100\\xa0g−\\xa01 higher soil moisture than the east facing (EF) aspect in the 0–15\\xa0cm and 15–30\\xa0cm soil depths, respectively. The SOC concentration was higher by 11–12% in the NF than the EF aspect. In the 0–30\\xa0cm soil profile, the SOC stock varied from 31.55 to 37.91\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−\\xa01 in the EF aspect and from 35.01 to 41.28\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−\\xa01 in the NF aspect, as compared to the initial stock of 18.19 and 19.06\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−\\xa01 in the two aspects, respectively. The NF aspect had 0.35 to 3.17\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−\\xa01 higher SOC stock in the 0–15\\xa0cm soil, 0.64 to 3.03\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−\\xa01 in the 15–30\\xa0cm soil and 1.85 to 4.59\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−\\xa01 in the whole 0–30\\xa0cm soil profile. Averaged over all the rehabilitation systems, the NF aspect accumulated extra C to the tune of 0.19, 0.18 and 0.36\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−\\xa01\\xa0yr−\\xa01 than the EF aspect in the 0–15, 15–30 and 0–30\\xa0cm soil layers, respectively.

(C. curviflora), Cyclea peltata Hook. F. & Thomson (C. peltata) and Euphorbia hirta L (E. hirta) used in folk medicines in Aarukani hills Kani tribe, Tamil Nadu, India against human bacterial pathogens.MethodsAntibacterial efficacy was performed by disc diffusion method against the pathogens viz., Escherichia coli (E. coli) (ATCC 35218), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (ATCC 6538), Salmonella typhi (S. typhi) (MTCC 733), Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) and Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C.ResultsThe maximum degree of antibacterial activity was observed in C. peltata followed by C. curviflora. While E. hirta showed comparatively low degree of antibacterial activity. The methanolic extract of C. peltata showed the antibacterial activity against three pathogens viz., S. pyogenes, P. vulgaris and E. coli with the inhibition zones 12 mm, 10 mm and 9 mm, respectively. hexane extracts of C. peltata also showed the antibacterial activity against two selected pathogens viz., P. vulgaris and P. mirabilis with 15 mm and 12 mm of inhibition zones. All the three different concentrations (0.25, 0.50 & 0.75 mg/mL) of methanolic extract of C. peltata show the inhibitory effect on the three susceptible bacteria S. pyogenes, P. vulgaris and E. coli with the maximum inhibition in the highest concentration (0.75 mg/mL). The methanolic and hexane extracts of C. curviflora exhibited the antibacterial activity against only one bacterium each i.e. P. vulgaris and S. typhi with the maximum zone of inhibition 13 and 11 mm respectively. The methanolic and hexane extracts of E. hirta exhibited the antibacterial activity against only one bacterium i.e. S. pyogenes with the maximum zone of inhibition 13 and 11 mm respectively.ConclusionsThe present investigation revealed that the C. curviflora, C. peltata and E. hirta are potentially good source of antibacterial agents and demonstrates the importance of such plants in traditional medicines.'], ['Biodiversity surveys were conducted in 13, 10×50 m2 plots located between 1400 to 3700 m above mean sea level in a range of habitats in temperate mixed Oak and Coniferous forests through sub-alpine to the alpine grasslands in Chamoli district of Uttaranchal state in the Indian Garhwal Himalaya. Cross-taxon congruence in biodiversity (α-diversity and β-diversity) across macrolichens, mosses, liverworts, woody plants (shrubs and trees) and ants was investigated, so as to examine the extent to which these groups of organisms can function as surrogates for each other. Although woody plants provided a major substrate for macrolichens and mosses, there was no species-specific association between them. Woody plant species richness was highly positively correlated with mosses (r2=0.63, P<0.001), but the relationship was not particularly very strong with lichens and liverworts. While there was a significant correlation in the species turnover (β-diversity) of macrolichens with mosses (r2=0.21, P<0.005), the relationship was relatively poor with the woody plants. On the other hand, negative correlations emerged in the species richness of ants with those of macrolichens, mosses and woody plants (r2=−0.44, P<0.05), but most of the complementarity (turnover) relationships among them were positive. Since diversity between taxonomic hierarchies within the group was consistently significantly positively correlated in all these taxa, the higher taxonomic categories such as genus and family may be employed as surrogates for rapid assessment and monitoring of species diversity. Although no single group other than macrolichens has emerged as a good indicator of changes in species richness in all other groups, some concordant relationships between them conform to the hypothesis that species assemblages of certain taxonomic groups could still be used as surrogates for efficient monitoring of species diversity in other groups whose distribution may further predict the importance of conserving overall biodiversity in landscapes such as the Garhwal Himalaya.'], ['Jackfruit is cross-pollinated and mostly seed propagated, a wide range of variation exists in fruit quality.

Biodiversity characters of the habitat provide the basis of prioritizing the sites in conservation effort. Since India is identified as one of the 12-mega biodiversity countries in the world, this task is of great significance. In India, biogeographers have long since recognized North-East India as one of the most diverse regions with respect to flora and fauna. Since historic times, human interventions had started influencing the landuse and landcover of this region. Deforestation is mainly attributed to shifting cultivation and commercial logging of timber. This has resulted in fragmentation of the landscape. Landscape fragmentation and degradation have been identified as fundamental reasons for biodiversity loss. The paper uses landscape ecological principles for biodiversity characterization. Satellite remote sensing data have been used for characterization of the landscape and stratification for ground inventory. A geographic information system has been used to spatially model the disturbance regimes and to integrate the ground based nonspatial data with the spatial characters of the landscape. The vegetation types and landuse of Meghalaya have been mapped using Indian remote sensing (IRS) time series data. The various parameters (viz. patch shape, patch size, number of patches, porosity, fragmentation and juxtaposition) have been analyzed on the most recent landcover map to spatially present the disturbance regimes. A spatial model incorporating ground based biodiversity attributes of the landscape elements, landuse change patterns, disturbance regimes of the landscape and terrain complexity have been used to delineate the spatial pattern of biological richness. This has been achieved using the landscape analysis package (LAP) developed at the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing. Habitat evaluation using ground based data and their spatial organization have been found to provide reliable information on the biodiversity distribution pattern. The present approach for prioritizing the biodiversity rich sites have the advantage of integrating spatial, non-spatial information and horizontal relationships.

A total of 839 homegardens in 28 panchayaths (lowest unit of local self-government) of Thrissur, Palakkad, and Malappuram districts were surveyed through a stratified random process. Information was gathered on holding size, floristic composition, plant height, and girth at breast height (GBH) of all trees and shrubs (>20\\xa0cm GBH). Aboveground C stocks of trees were computed using allometric relationships, assuming C as 50% of biomass. The homegardens were also classified into small (<0.4\\xa0ha), medium (0.4–1.2\\xa0ha), and large (>1.2\\xa0ha). In total, 473 species were recorded, of which 208 were trees (>20\\xa0cm GBH), 86 shrubs, and 179 herbs. Simpson's floristic diversity index (0.64, 0.41, and 0.46 for a subset of small, medium, and large homegardens, respectively), species richness, and tree density (per hectare) were highest for small-sized holdings. Large-sized homegardens, however, had more stems per garden. Average aboveground standing stocks of C ranged from 16 to 36\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1, with small homegardens having higher C stocks on unit area basis than large- and medium-sized ones. Implicit in this is the potential for C sequestration and agrobiodiversity conservation, especially by small homegardens.\"], ['onsidering the importance of sustainable production practices with greater resource use efficiency, a study was conducted during 2009–12 to understand the soil properties, crop yield, and economics as affected by the integrated crop management (ICM) practices under the Bhoochetana (soil rejuvenation) program in Karnataka, India. Results from 3776 crop-cutting studies on different crops (cereals, pulses, and oilseeds) revealed that there is a vast spatial variability in case of various soil nutrients across different taluks of Karnataka. Balanced fertilizer application, both in rainfed and irrigated areas, directly influenced crop yields. Yields of cereals, legumes, and oilseeds were 3590, 1400, and 2230\\xa0kg\\xa0ha−1 with improved management practices as compared to 2650, 1030, and 1650\\xa0kg\\xa0ha−1 with conventional farming practices, respectively. Average net income estimated from conventional farming was Rs. 26,290\\xa0ha−1, while it was Rs. 35,540\\xa0ha−1 from improved management practices, which indicated that ICM practices resulted in an additional 35% income. The oilseeds performed better in terms of achieving higher net income and benefit–cost ratio while the cereals and legumes also have shown significant improvement in yield compared to the yields from conventional farming practices. The detailed findings on soil properties, yields of crops, and economics suggested that there is a vast potential for crop productivity improvement through ICM practices across different soil types and rainfall zones of Karnataka, India.'], ['Ophiorrhiza mungos var. angustifolia is a member of Rubiaceae family can be a gold standard for the in vitro production of high-value anticancer compound camptothecin to meet the increasing market demand for medicine. Multiple shoot cultures of Ophiorrhiza mungos var. angustifolia was induced in the nodal explant using half-strength Murashige and Skoog solid media supplemented with different concentrations of cytokinins (4.44–22.19\\u202fμM Benzyl adenine and 4.65–23.23\\u202fμM Kinetin either individually or in combination) and auxins (4.92–24.6\\u202fμM Indole butyric acid, 5.37–24.6\\u202fμM Indole acetic acid and 5.71–28.54\\u202fμM in combination with Benzyl adenine) for three weeks. Among the plant growth regulators treated, benzyl adenine (8.88\\u202fμM) was found to be the most effective in multiple shoot induction (22\\u202f±\\u202f3.90 shoots/explant), thus further shoot multiplication is achieved in fresh media with the same composition. Increased camptothecin production is achieved by the elicitation of multiple shoots using methyl jasmonate (50, 100, 150 and 200\\u202fμM), salicylic acid (50, 100, 150 and 200\\u202fμM) and chitosan (10, 50,100 and 150\\u202fmg/l) separately under a different period of incubation.

Against this situation, the Melamchi Water Supply megaproject, supported by several foreign investors, was launched in 2000 to quench Kathmanduties’ thirst by bringing water from Melamchi River through a 26\\xa0km-long tunnel. After more than 10\\xa0years, progress has been very modest. Besides the political instability of the country, opposition from certain sectors of society in both the urban and rural settings has created continuous disruptions of the works. We draw on Urban Political Ecology and Environmental Justice frameworks to analyze two distinct, although interconnected, social struggles battling against the project. The first one, anchored in the urban sphere, took advantage of the entry of the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoists, and succeeded in bringing down Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) lending condition of handing over the water supply management to a private sector operator. The second one concerns the ongoing struggle of the rural residents affected by the inter-basin transfer. Local people in the rural areas mainly advocated conservation of their source of livelihood and political recognition. In the last part, we discuss how the use of local water sources and community-based alternatives may emerge as an alternative to hegemonic models of nature–society relations and contribute to overcome such conflicts and reduce negative impacts on the environment and social injustices.'], ['The present study aims at evaluating three soil erosion models; Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE); Unit Sediment graph (USG) and Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP). The models were tested on small watersheds within the Pamba River basin of Kerala, India, using the data on observed rainfall-runoff-sediment yield events. Three watersheds are selected with varying land use types, topography and drainage density. Three erosion models were applied for the same rainfall events and the results were compared with the observed sediment yield values. It was seen that the USG predicted the rate of sediment yield better than the other two models. Even though WEPP is a physically distributed model, the large and detailed data requirement, which is impractical in studies of this scale, affected its prediction accuracy. Application MUSLE gives the large errors compared to the observed sediment yield. Therefore, it was found from this study that the Unit Sediment Graph (USG) based approach is having better applicability for the prevailing climatic and geographical setup.'], ['Invasion of native communities by exotic species has been among the most perverse ecological problems in recent years. In the present study, we predicted the probable distribution of two invasive plant species Mimosa diplotricha Sauvalle and Mikania micrantha Kunth in a protected tropical grassland of Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park, Assam, Northeast India using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) distribution modelling algorithm. We found that about 30–40% (25–30\\xa0km2) area of the protected area (78.8\\xa0km2) have high chances of being invaded by both the invasive plants that are prime habitat to the greater one horned Rhinoceros and other important grassland dwellers. Both the models have an accuracy of AUC\\xa0>\\xa00.99. Precipitation in warmest quarters played a major role among the environmental variables in spread of both the invasive plants. The findings of the present study will help the management authority to take the necessary steps in the identified area to chalk out a comprehensive strategy for control of the invasive plant species. The probable areas most likely to be invaded by the invasive plant species have to be monitored regularly, and intervention like manual uprooting needs to be scheduled during the early stage of its life cycle and before flowering. The frontline staffs of the national park need to be apprised about the ecology and impact of invasive plants for better monitoring and eradication of these detrimental plants.'], ['Tropical dry deciduous forests play a significant role in regulating the biogeochemical cycles.

The restoration strategies being planned for the earthen plaster demand detailed scientific investigation to understand technology and composition so as to prepare matching plaster. The mineralogical, micro-structural and chemical characterization of the earthen plasters have been investigated by analytical tools like petrological microscope, XRF, CHN analysis, laser scattering particle size analyzer, FTIR, XRD, Scanning Electron Microscopy, thermal analyzer (DGA/DTA) as well as on-site observations. A comparative study with nearby sites portrays the earthen plaster of Pithalkhora coarser (silt: 62–100%, sand: 2–2.2%) with traces of clay (0–2%); hence it may be prone to damage by grain breakages. The chemical composition confirms that the aggregates mixed with the earthen plaster belong to that of locally available basaltic origin. SEM studies show addition of quartz and traces of clay (illite and montmorillonite) to augment the flexibility and performance of the plaster. The restoration plaster should be synthesized with aggregates of locally available basaltic rock mixed with slaked lime in addition with rice husk and other vegetal fibres as vegetal additive to overcome the shrinkage of the plaster.\"], ['Camptothecine, a potent eukaryotic topoisomerase inhibitor, is an important anticancer compound. The global demand for this compound was estimated to be $1\\xa0billion in 2003 and is only further expected to increase. Partly to meet the expected increase in demand, in the recent past, several efforts have been made to discover newer and alternative plant and fungal sources of camptothecine. In this study we report a rich source of camptothecine and its natural derivatives, Pyrenacantha volubilis (Icacinaceae) from the eastern coast of peninsular India. Camptothecine and its derivatives were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) in all plant parts such as twigs, leaves, roots, seedling, ripened whole fruit, fruit coat, seed coat and cotyledons. Cotyledons and ripened whole fruits contained the highest amount of camptothecine (1.35% and 0.60% dry weight respectively). LC-MS and ESI-MS/MS analyses revealed besides camptothecine, other derivatives and precursors such as 10-hydroxycamptothecine, 9-methoxycamptothecine, 20-deoxycamptothecine, deoxypumiloside, strictosidine and strictosamide.

It is highly essential to identify the prominent changes responsible for its occurrence so that suitable measures can be adopted. An attempt was made to identify the prominent land use and land cover changes responsible for the spread of chikungunya, malaria, and dengue fever in the State of Kerala, India, using hierarchical cluster analysis and multiple regression analysis. Large extent of water bodies, low land and agricultural land played a significant role on the incidence of chikungunya and malaria. High population density, built-up area and agricultural area favoured dengue fever. Vector-borne diseases were found to be the lowest in places where there is no low land and with higher forest area. Inappropriate disposal of wastes generated in the built-up area might be the reason for the spread of dengue fever. Freshwater in drains of these areas is polluted and form breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Hence much attention is to be paid to provide appropriate treatment and disposal of wastes generated in the built-up area of the State In an evolving urban policy, priority is to be given to the installation of safe treatment and disposal facility of wastes especially, sewage, sullage, and solid waste. The protection of forest land also plays an important role. Economic policy instruments such as Payment for Environment Services (PES) schemes, may constitute a useful tool to encourage an improved land use management through appropriate price signals, such as, for instance, for the preservation of forested areas especially in proximity of highly populated urban environments.'], [\"Safe drinking water scarcity is an acute problem in the coastal regions of Bangladesh which is mainly caused by salinity intrusion. In this context, drinking water sources are severely affected, including adverse effects on agriculture, health, fisheries and the ecosystem.

It is these priority or critical hydrologic units or sub-watersheds that need preferential soil and water conservation measures to reduce maximum sediment load in the watershed, particularly in arid/semi-arid fragile environments.The semi-quantitative method of the Sediment Yield Index (SYI) model, developed by the All India Soil and Land Use Survey of the Government of India for priority delineation in River Valley Projects, is used in India and studies have revealed that there is an overall reduction of sediment outflows of up to 60%.The paper describes a new concept of introducing Integrated Resources Units (IRUs) in the model. An IRU is the smallest, but viable, planning unit which leads to strategies ideally suited for scientific development of a watershed. The IRUs encompass all the relevant watershed resources, generated from map-, ground- and space-based systems, and is the strategic unit for assigning the erosivity and transportability values of the detached material in the SYI model for gradation of priority classes of sub-watersheds.

Three epiphytic groups viz. orchids, pteridophytes and non-orchid angiosperm epiphytes were specifically studied in closed, selectively logged and in unlogged forests with treefall gaps. Logging reduced the structural complexity of the forests and altered their microclimate. With logging, there was a general decline in richness and abundance of epiphytes except orchids. The abundance and species composition of pteridophytes and non-orchid angiosperm epiphytes were related to microclimate and substrate features while their richness were correlated only with canopy cover. In contrast, orchid species composition was related to forest structure. A combination of management strategies is required for conservation of all epiphyte groups. A mosaic of logged and unlogged forest patches with undisturbed forests in proximity would maintain the diversity of pteridophytes and other angiosperms. However, for full representation of orchids, it is necessary to maintain the structural diversity of the tree forms.'], [\"The present paper deals with Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level, preparing thematic maps for spatial representation of landscape parameters and then validation of the geospatial model using a three-tier approach, viz., landscape analysis, field data extrapolation and geospatial analysis, for two groups of islands in Indian subcontinent. On-screen visual interpretation approach based on IRS LISS-III and Landsat TM data sets was used to delineate the vegetation communities. Field survey attributes on species diversity, economical/medicinal uses and endemism were suitably linked with satellite image-derived landscape attributes in a geospatial domain. The landscape parameters, viz., fragmentation and disturbance index, clearly indicate that Nicobar Islands are less disturbed compared to Andaman. The phytosociological data of different vegetation types collected from 544 stratified sample points was recorded with ground coordinates. The plant communities of Andaman show high plant diversity in terms of number of species (523 species) and more heterogeneity compared to those of Nicobar (347 species). Biological richness was estimated as a function of six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical and ecological) to stratify forest vegetation in two phytogeographically distinct groups of tropical islands, viz., Andaman and Nicobar, using a customized software, SPLAM.Validation of ecological indices had always been a major challenge for ecologist. Here, we discuss a validation technique using field-driven species regression equations for fragmentation (FR), disturbance (DI) and biological richness (BR) indices and propose improvements in the biological richness methodology. The research question of establishment of linkages between expressions of diversity at different scales is sought and thereby validating the existing model outputs has been proposed. The sensitivity of in-field measurements with landscape parameters has been explicitly analyzed. During validation, the species richness, diversity and mean basal area have shown slow decrease with sudden rise in intermediate levels followed by a steep decline at increasing levels of fragmentation and disturbance. The empirically derived regression coefficient has significant correspondence (p\\xa0<\\xa00.05) in terms of community response in both island's groups. The vegetation communities in the forested landscape possess significant linkages with landscape scale processes, viz., FR and DI, as evident by the degree of correlation. The heterogeneity measured as diversity in habit group shows community dimensions in different spatial zones. The generation of baseline data on community ecology allows prioritization of planning process and evolves specific management practices. It may be concluded that the improved biodiversity assessment model and the designed validation techniques have enhanced the reliability of model thus widened the scope for its application in the rapid biodiversity assessment.\"], ['The aim of the present work is to examine the recent Holocene history of Libyan mammals by integrating data from archaeoozology, prehistoric iconography, historical and recent observations, in order to offer a starting point for future studies. The available data document the past diffusion of species – belonging to both Palaearctic and Afrotropical biogeography – some of which may still survive in some of the more remote desert reaches of this North African state. An additional aim is to compile a bibliographic corpus on Libyan mammals, with particular reference to Italian literature.'], ['Understanding the factors that give rise to greater or lesser adaptive capacity among households with in a community could allow government interventions to target the right groups of people. In this paper we study such factors, making use of a household survey administered in the Indian state of Odisha. In the survey, we queried respondents for the adaptations that they had engaged in to deal with the risk of drought, as well as a number of indicators for adaptive capacity taken from the literature. We found a large number of indicators of adaptive capacity to correlate with one or more adaptations taken. However, many of these indicators, while increasing the likelihood that one adaptation would be taken, also decreased the likelihood that another would be taken, and hence were not unambiguous determinants of greater adaptive capacity in general. One indicator, access to crop insurance, stood out as particularly effective: it correlated with an increased likelihood of engaging in two separate yield-raising adaptations, and correlated with a decreased likelihood of engaging in two additional adaptations that would have the effect of reducing yields. The results suggest that further attention to crop insurance may be warranted, as well as further research to determine if the other indicators may be effective in other contextual settings.'], ['Ethnopharmacological relevanceSafed musli (Chlorophytum borivilianum) is an eminent medicinal plant of India and considered as a ‘white gold’ or ‘divya aushad’ in Indian systems of medicine. In Ayurveda, Chlorophytum borivilianum belongs to the group of “Vajikaran Rasayana” corroborated to its rejuvenating, aphrodisiac, natural sex tonic properties and effective in alleviating sexual disorders. It is largely used as ethnic medicine by local healers of indigenous communities of India.Materials and methodsA thorough bibliographic investigation was carried out by analyzing worldwide accepted scientific data base (Pub Med, SciFinder, Scopus and Web of Science), thesis, recognized books, non impact and non indexed journals.ResultsTraditionally, Chlorophytum borivilianum is well known for treating male impotency in India. The multi therapeutic and nutritional importance of Chlorophytum borivilianum is attributed to the rich source of phytochemicals particularly saponins. Recently, Chlorophytum borivilianum has gained a well established domestic (Indian) and international market for being the herbal alternative of “Viagra” without any side effects. Under the trade name ‘Nai Chetna’, the state government of Gujarat, India, has launched a novel potency drug from Chlorophytum borivilianum. Modern pharmacological studies of Chlorophytum borivilianum have demonstrated a wide range of pharmacological activities, most importantly aphrodisiac, immunomodulatory and anticancer activities.ConclusionThe increased commercial exploitation of Chlorophytum borivilianum and low productivity of this endangered plant has raised the concern over its conservation. It has been envisaged that efforts should be made to standardize, encourage and popularize the cultivation of Chlorophytum borivilianum as a commercial crop. The analysis of previous pharmacological investigations suggested lack of substantial scientific evidences in various studies and do not stand the test of critical assessment. Due to high economic value, Chlorophytum borivilianum has also encountered a problem of adulteration with closely resembling medicinally inferior species. The studies available on toxicity, safety and quality of Chlorophytum borivilianum are inadequate for providing information on commercial utilization. Thus, the present review summarizes comprehensive information on Chlorophytum borivilianum and possible scope for future research to fill the existing lacunae on its different aspects of the study.'], ['The hilly district of Uttara Kannada (13° 55′ N–15° 32′ N Latitude and 74° 5′ E–75° 5′ E Longitude), with an area of 10 200 km2, is one of the most forested tracts of south India, although the total area under forest has been reduced from 80% to 70% over the past century. Excellent documentation of the bird fauna exists from the 1890s and 1980s, with a shorter survey conducted in 1938. An analysis of these three surveys suggests that the size of the total bird fauna has remained constant around 465 ± 20 taxa over this period. However, most of the thirty-one resident bird taxa recorded earlier but not sighted in the recent survey, as well as nine taxa observed only recently, are notable habitat specialists. Only a few of these specialists that have probably been lost over this period are forest birds, the majority being characteristic of the drier cultivation and scrub areas. Recent invaders seem to prefer aquatic ecosystems, and it is suggested that this may be a more general pattern. It is therefore vital that more attention be paid to conservation of the biological diversity of the semi-arid tracts of the Indian subcontinent.'], ['There are plans to double the area of strictly protected tropical forest. This article suggests that the siting and management of such reserves are based on models of conservation inappropriate to developing countries, and that an ignorance of past and present tropical land use will prevent reserves achieving their major objective of conserving useful biodiversity. Strict preservation could also destroy the indigenous knowledge needed for ecosystem management. Multipurpose management and continued human use of tropical forests is a more effective and sustainable conservation policy for tropical developing countries. Rural communities should be actively and physically involved in the future productive management of tropical forests, rather than being induced or pressured into abandoning their forest heritage.'], ['Bergenia ciliata is a medicinal plant used for the treatment of kidney stones. The presented review is the first attempt to gather utmost information about the distribution, ethno-medicines, phytochemical analysis, pharmacology and toxicology of B. ciliata. This review was designed with the aim to compile fragmented information about B. ciliata in addition to explore its therapeutic potential and future research opportunities. A total of 185 research papers were reviewed using several data sources such as; Web of Science, Scopus, Google scholar, Science direct and PubMed. Results of this review revealed that B. ciliata is being used to cure 104 different types of ailments. Although among reported disorders B. ciliata showed high potential in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders but it is well known for the treatment of kidney disorders particularly kidney stones. Literature review showed that traditional healers mostly utilize it in powder form. Moreover, B. ciliata was reported to possess high antifungal, antiviral, anti plasmodial and antibacterial activities. Pharmacological studies reported that it has good antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tussive, anti-ulcer and anti-neoplastic activities. Variety of secondary metabolites belonging to different classes of compounds such as phenols, alcohols, terpenoids and fatty acid were reportedly isolated from B. ciliata. In spite of having better efficiency of ethno medicines and good pharmacological potential, B. ciliata has also shown toxic effects on living system in several studies. We invite the attention of researchers to carry out detailed ethno-pharmacological and toxicological studies on this valuable plant species in order to provide reliable knowledge to the patients and discover more novel compounds for the development of new drugs with fewer side effects on the living system as compare to modern medicines.'], ['Inhabitants of the upper Himalayan regions entertain a belief that the Chir Pine trees are ingressing the Broadleaf forest areas and that these areas are gradually turning into water stressed regions as Chir Pines adversely influence water recharge and water availability. This paper examines whether and to what extent the Chir Pine forest areas are water stressed compared to Broadleaf forest areas by studying the household coping cost in relation to water stress. We use the coping cost differences thereafter to value the relative water provisioning services of forest types. We conduct multiple focus group discussions, a questionnaire survey and statistical analyses to derive the results. Results show all households, except the ones living near Deodar forest, to face water stress in summer but the Chir Pine areas are the most water-stressed. Both comparison of mean and multivariate regressions of water collection time and other coping costs show that the villagers surrounded by Deodar, Deodar mix pine, Broadleaf mix bush or Broadleaf mix pine forests spend much less time for water collection and spend less on water treatment and storage compared to the villagers surrounded by Chir Pine forest irrespective of elevation, aspect or model used. These differences in water collection time amount to a wage income loss between USD 31 and USD 318 in India, and between USD 23 and USD 238 in Nepal per year per household, in Chir Pine areas compared to other forest areas.'], ['An efficient micropropagation protocol for high frequency plant regeneration was developed using nodal explants derived in vitro seedlings of Bambusa arundinacea which is an important multipurpose and edible bamboo species and recalcitrant to tissue culture.

Landscape ecology is an important interface between the forest management community, which is a traditional user of operations research methods, and the biological conservation community which is relatively new to OR methods and whose goals are increasingly allied with the spatial ecology concepts emerging from landscape ecology. Deforestation and forest fragmentation are increasingly recognized as the underlying drivers of global biodiversity loss, hence forestry management will need to explicitly incorporate spatial ecology objectives.A deforestation model is presented which simulates a landscape progressively fragmenting by the incremental removal of forest patches. Principal components analysis (PCA) of multiple deforestation simulations captures the relative influence of the mean proximity index and the mean nearest neighbour distance, two widely used landscape ecology metrics. An evolutionary programming method based on a genetic encoding of landscape structure is used to optimize forest patch selection by maximizing landscape performance with respect to single and multiple landscape ecology metrics weighted according to the PCA.This optimization approach is envisioned as a key component of a new forestry OR paradigm for designing multi-use landscape systems, incorporating both biodiversity and community needs.'], ['Land use and land cover maps can support our understanding of coupled human-environment systems and provide important information for environmental modeling and water resource management. Satellite data are a valuable source for land use and land cover mapping. However, cloud-free or weather independent data are necessary to map cloud-prone regions. This particularly applies to monsoon regions such as the Chennai basin, located in the north of Tamil Nadu and the south of Andhra Pradesh, India, which is influenced by the South Asian Monsoon and has abundant cloud cover, throughout the monsoon season. The Basin is characterized by small-scale agriculture with multiple cropping seasons and the rapidly developing metropolitan area of Chennai. This study aims to generate a land use and land cover map of the Chennai Basin for the cropping season of Rabi 2015/16 and to assess the influence of combining the new ESA Copernicus satellites Sentinel-1 and -2 on classification accuracies. A Random Forest based wrapper approach was applied to select the most relevant radar (Sentinel-1) images for the combination with the optical (Sentinel-2) data. Area proportion weighted accuracy with 95% confidence interval were estimated for the Random Forest models, which differentiated 13 land cover classes. The highest overall accuracy of 91.53% ± 0.89 pp was achieved with a combination of 1 Sentinel-2 and 8 Sentinel-1 scenes. This is an improvement of 5.68 pp over a classification with Sentinel-2 data only. An addition of further Sentinel-1 scenes showed no improvement in overall accuracy. The strongest improvement in class-specific accuracy was achieved for paddy fields. This study shows for the first time how land use and land cover classifications in cloud-prone monsoon regions with small-scale agriculture and multiple cropping patterns can be improved by combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data.'], ['Ethnopharmacological relevanceMedicinal plants are treating and preventing a variety disease.

Soil respiration measurements and microbial isolation were performed following standard procedures. Monthly variation of soil respiration was observed to be governed by soil moisture. Considering respiration as a function of microbial population a regression analysis was made. The microfungal population showed positive relationship with the rate of soil respiration. The study revealed that conversion of natural forest led to a reduction of soil microbes and rate of soil respiration. Considering the importance of the microbial component in soil, we conclude that the conversion of natural forests to different land uses leads to the loss of biological stability of the soil.'], ['Increasing negative effects of fossil fuel combustion on the environment in addition to limited stock have forced many countries to explore and change to environmentally friendly alternatives that are renewable to sustain the increasing energy demand. Changing to renewable sources and implementation of effective conservation measures would ensure sustainability. Currently, wind energy is one of the fastest developing renewable energy source technologies across the globe. Wind energy is an alternative clean energy source compared to fossil fuel, which pollute the lower layer of the atmosphere. It has the advantage of being harnessed on a local basis for application in rural and remote areas. In order to tap the potential of wind energy sources, there is a need to assess the availability of the resources spatially. Mapping potential sites for tapping wind energy in Karnataka (a federal State in India) is the focus of this study. The study employs the geographical information system (GIS) to map the wind energy resources of Karnataka state and analyse their variability considering spatial and seasonal aspects. Considering these, the present status of the potential is assessed and maps of locations suitable for tapping wind energy have been prepared. A spatial data base with data of wind velocities has been developed and used for evaluation of the theoretical potential through continuous monitoring and mapping of the wind resources. The study shows that the average wind velocity in Karnataka varies from 0.85\\xa0m/s in Bagalkote to 8.28\\xa0m/s in Chikkodi during the monsoon season. Chikkodi, in Belgaum district, has high wind velocity during the period May to September with a peak value of 9.18\\xa0m/s in July.

Gradually, the capacities of hydropower plants became very large due to increased electricity demand. Large-scale hydroelectric plants now contribute significantly to meeting the state's and the nation's demand for electricity. Most of Karnataka's hydroelectric plants are located in Uttara Kannada district. Construction of large reservoirs is restricted due to environmental constraints and necessitates the development of ecologically sound alternatives to cater for the needs of the region. The planning of water resources depends on type and size of projects, the ecological factors involved, etc. Emphasis is placed on presenting an overview of water resources through meteorological, hydrological, ecological and economic data. Economic data includes all costs and benefits, specifically hitherto underestimated, environmental social costs and benefits. This study was carried out in Bedthi and Aghnashini rivers in Uttara Kannada district of the Western Ghats region, Karnataka state, India. An estimated 720 and 510 million kWh of electricity can be generated in Bedthi and Aghnashini river basins if all the streams are harnessed. Focusing on land submergence impact, a model is proposed to minimize submergence and maximize net energy in a region, with seasonal power generation, reservoir storage capacity (so as to meet the region's demand during all seasons) and installed generation capacity as the decision variables. Net energy analyses incorporating biomass energy lost in submergence show that maximization in net energy at a site is possible, if the hydroelectric generation capacity is adjusted according to the seasonal variations in the river's water discharge. A decision support system (DSS) used in water resource planning for electricity generation is discussed in this paper.\"], ['Ethnopharmacological relevanceIndia is having a rich vegetation with a wide variety of plants, because of the extreme variations in geographical and climatic conditions prevailing in the country.

They still depend on medicinal plants and most of them have a basic knowledge of medicinal plants which are used for first aid remedies, to treat cough, cold, fever, headache, poisonous bites and some simple ailments. The present study was initiated with an aim to identify traditional healers who are practicing herbal medicine among the Kani tribals in Thodu hills of Kerala, India and quantitatively document their indigenous knowledge on the utilization of medicinal plants, particularly most common ethnomedicinal plants.MethodsA field study was carried out over a period of 1 year in Thodu hills. The ethnomedicinal information was collected through interviews among the Kani traditional healers. The collected data were analyzed through use value (UV), informant consensus factor (Fic), fidelity level (FL) and relative importance (RI).ResultsDuring the present study a total of 35 medicinal plant species belonging to 28 families and 34 genera have been documented. These plants were used to treat various diseases and ailments grouped under 14 disease categories, with the highest number of species (7) being used for liver problems, circulatory system and dermatological disorders, followed by skeleto muscular system disorders (6), and fever (5). In the study area the informant consensus about usages of medicinal plants ranges from 0.70 to 1 with an average value of 0.83. Herbs (46%) were the primary source of medicine, followed by shrubs (23%). Plumbago zeylanica (UV of 1.86) and Ocimum tenuiflorum (UV of 1.57) are the most frequently and popularly used medicinal plant species in the study area. Aristolochia tagala is rare and a vulnerable climber, Curculigo orchioides, Elephantopus scaber, Helicteres isora, Smilax zeylanica and Strychnos nux-vomica are rare species which need to be conserved for future use.ConclusionThe high degree of consensus among the informants suggests that the current use and knowledge is still strong. The efficacy and safety of all the reported ethnomedicinal plants needs to be evaluated for phytochemical and pharmacological studies, especially the plants with high informant consensus factor, use value and fidelity level should be given priority to carry out bioassay and toxicity studies.

Biological richness (BR) is a cumulative property of an ecological habitat and its surrounding environment, which has emerging implications in terms of management and planning. Six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical and ecological) were linked together based on their relative importance to qualitatively stratify biological richness of forest vegetation in Subansiri district of Eastern Himalaya using customized software, Bio_CAP. Higher biological richness was assigned to the habitats with (i) high species diversity, (ii) high degree of ecosystem uniqueness (EU), (iii) high economical value, (iv) complex terrain and (v) low disturbance level. This simple idea of integrated ‘three-tier modeling approach’ of (i) utilization of geospatial tools, (ii) limited field survey and (iii) landscape analysis; formed the basis of rapid assessment of biological richness.Satellite image interpretation using hybrid classification approach provided spatial distribution of vegetation types (corresponding to ecological habitats), with 89% accuracy. Landscape analysis was done using various quantitative indices that measured the heterogeneity and evaluated the patch characteristics. A methodology was developed for deriving relative adjacency weights from field data for calculation of juxtaposition of vegetation types. Biotic disturbance buffers (i.e., proximity zones around roads and human settlements) along with landscape parameters were combined to calculate disturbance index (DI), which in turn became an intermediate surrogate for BR assessment. Species diversity patterns along fragmentation and biotic disturbance gradients were adjudged to derive relative weights for DI computation. Species diversity (Shannon's index), ecosystem uniqueness (endemism status) and biodiversity value (BV) (total importance value (TIV)) were enumerated quantitatively that provided relative weights for BR computation. Terrain complexity (TC) was generated by calculating variance of the elevation image. Fifty-nine of total 764 species were found endemic to Eastern Himalaya with over all species endemism of 13 per ha. Shannon's index increased with decrease in fragmentation levels and increase of distance from sources of disturbance. BR index of the district was presented in five qualitative levels. Subtropical forests claim highest degree of biological richness as well as high disturbance index. This methodology has implications for rapid biodiversity assessment. Forest managers can use the DI and BR maps for gap analysis and prioritization of conservation activities viz., introduction of locale-specific species, thus protecting the forest habitats in situ.\"], ['Native to Latin America, Mikania micrantha is considered as one of the top invaders in the moist tropical zones of the Pacific and Asian countries, including India. This study was conducted with two specific objectives − first, to examine the niche and biome conservancy of M. micrantha between its native and Indian ranges and second, to understand the potential distribution of this invasive plant in India. Principal Component Analysis of climatic variables associated with known occurrences of M. micrantha in India and native ranges indicated significant shifts in climatic niche of M. micrantha in India. Temperature and precipitation seasonality were found to be the driving factors for the niche shift in India. Our study also revealed that in India M. micrantha invaded a novel biome viz. the temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, which was present but unoccupied in the native range. Given the climatic niche shift, both Indian and native occurrence data were used to model the potential distribution of this weed in India using MaxEnt. The predicted distribution identified that a larger extent of the Indian landmass is climatically suitable for M. micrantha growth. High climatic suitability of some of the urban centers of India adds to the risk of further spread of this plant into ‘still to be invaded’ areas.

Hence, an attempt has been made to compile medicinally important pteridophytes used by different ethnic minorities and local people in India.Materials and methodsRelevant information on the uses of pteridophytes was extracted from scientific journals (local, regional, and international), books, book chapters, conference proceedings, M.Sc. and Ph.D. dissertations, and other scientific databases. Recent and accepted names of plants were validated using standard nomenclature databases.ResultsIn total, 283 species of pteridophytes are enumerated in this review which are used to treat 129 ailments. Ethnobotanical records from the states Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand revealed 59% of overall uses of pteridophytes from India. Pteridaceae was recorded with highest number of medicinally important species (57), followed by Polypodiaceae, Dryopteridaceae, Thelypteridaceae, and Aspleniaceae with 36, 27, 22, and 21 species respectively.ConclusionsThe use of medicinal plants in the primary healthcare of humans and livestock has been documented since ancient times, and they offer a useful source of new therapeutics. While pteridophytes have considerable importance in traditional pharmacopoeias, scientific studies on pharmacology of this group are scanty. Hence, studies on the phytochemistry and pharmacology of medicinally important pteridophytes with more citations may reveal active principles that can be further developed into novel therapeutic agents.

In this context, succession on post-agricultural lands may be arrested by a variety of site-specific biotic and abiotic factors. Here we synthesise our research on the effects of five biotic factors (seed dispersal, development of a soil seed bank, seedling emergence, herbivory, competition) and five abiotic factors (fire, microclimatic conditions, soil nutrients, water availability, disturbance) as constraints to forest succession on degraded anthropogenic grasslands in a tropical lower montane forest landscape in Sri Lanka. The aim of this research was to deduce ecologically and socially acceptable restoration techniques to accelerate forest recovery. Colonisation of grasslands by trees is constrained by limited seed dispersal from adjacent remnant forest patches and their incorporation into grassland soil seed banks. For the few tree seeds that are dispersed into grasslands, a combination of vertebrate herbivory and annual dry season fires reduces the likelihood that they emerge as seedlings. Removal of the grass canopy by clipping or tilling increases the emergence of woody plant seedlings close to the boundaries of forest patches, but has no effect beyond 20\\xa0m into the established grassland. Our research shows that isolation of seedling root systems from those of competing grasses increases the growth and survival of tree seedlings transplanted directly into grassland swards, while above-ground competition and exclusion of vertebrate herbivores has no effects on seedling growth and survival. These experiments identified that the early-successional species Macaranga indica Wight and Symplocos cochinchinensis (Lour.) S. Moore are potential candidates for use in reforestation programmes on abandoned grasslands. We propose a strategy for a model forest restoration programme based on the creation of vegetation islands using early-successional native tree species, the application of a tilling treatment around remnant forest patches, creation of fire breaks around vegetation islands, and the protection of isolated individual trees and tree patches within established grasslands. We highlight the importance of further research on the ecology and biology of seed dispersers and seed predators, and expansion of knowledge on the regeneration traits of native tree species, for future refinements of this restoration strategy.'], ['Sensitivity of monsoon rainfall to different ambient wind speeds, orography and wind shear was studied using a two-dimensional mesoscale model. Three numerical experiments were performed with different initial uniform ambient wind speeds (U = 0.1 ms−1, 5 ms−1 and 10 ms−1) for a typical summer day. It was found that the rainfall increased over the mountain slopes as the initial ambient wind increased. As expected, sheared flow produced increased amounts of precipitation as compared to the uniform ambient flow.Effect of sea/land temperature difference on monsoon rainfall was also investigated. Incorporation of diurnal heating caused the surface pressure gradient to increase, leading to local accelerations of winds, increased mesoscale circulations and more rainfall. The model did not predict precipitation when the orography was not considered.'], ['The lowland tropical forests of Southeast Asia are dominated by a single family of canopy and emergent trees, the Dipterocarpaceae. The seeds of dipterocarps are gravity or gyration dispersed. Short distance and limited seed dispersal via these mechanisms result in the aggregation of related individuals and strong fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS). In logged and fragmented forests, where gene flow may be disrupted, tree species with strong FSGS are predicted to exhibit increased inbreeding, which consequently can erode genetic diversity, fitness and might limit the potential for natural regeneration of dipterocarps. Developing a set of indirect operational indicators for FSGS provides a solid basis for informing conservation and management of forest genetic resources in logged forests. Our main objective was to use an information theoretic approach to identify these indicators of FSGS in dipterocarps. We quantify FSGS in 19 dipterocarp species across four forest sites in Malaysian Borneo, India and the Seychelles. We detected FSGS in 15 (79%) of our study species, most of which displayed significant inbreeding. Our results suggest that wood density and flower size offer useful indicators of FSGS. We propose some simple guidelines to allow forest managers to account for FSGS when planning approaches to maintain genetically diverse stands in logged dipterocarp forests. The integration of improved understanding of genetic processes is essential for conserving forest tree genetic resources and ensuring the resilience of logged forests.'], ['Patchouli (Pogostemon cablin Benth.) is an industrially valued aromatic medicinal plant currently having a huge demand for its essential oil. It is widely used in flavor and fragrance industries as well as in pharmaceuticals. Clonal propagation is therefore obligatory to obtain homogeneous patchouli plants from preferred germplasm in order to meet the global need. At present, farmers are showing keen interest towards its large scale cultivation mainly in the tropical and sub-tropical countries. Understanding the plant biology, chemistry and other uses allows better utilization of any industrial crops. Therefore, the present review discusses on the botany, agronomy and biotechnological aspects of patchouli. Also, the current market demand for patchouli raw material is being reviewed by highlighting the possible exploration of modern techniques in identifying the adulterants to authenticate this herb. This review provides a comprehensive information on both basic and applied aspects of patchouli crop cultivation and management. The applied aspect of patchouli biotechnology allows one to explore the newer potential for various industrial uses and improve the rural economy.'], ['An energy resource that is renewed by nature and whose supply is not affected by the rate of consumption is often termed as renewable energy. The need to search for renewable, alternate and non-polluting sources of energy assumes top priority for self-reliance in the regional energy supply. This demands an estimation of available energy resources spatially to evolve better management strategies for ensuring sustainability of resources. The spatial mapping of availability and demand of energy resources would help in the integrated regional energy planning through an appropriate energy supply–demand matching. This paper discusses the application of Geographical Information System (GIS) to map the renewable energy potential talukwise in Karnataka State, India. Taluk is an administrative division in the federal set-up in India to implement developmental programmes like dissemination of biogas, improved stoves, etc. Hence, this paper focuses talukwise mapping of renewable energy (solar, wind, bioenergy and small hydroenergy) potential for Karnataka using GIS. GIS helps in spatial and temporal analyses of the resources and demand and also aids as Decision Support System while implementing location-specific renewable energy technologies.Regions suitable for tapping solar energy are mapped based on global solar radiation data, which provides a picture of the potential. Coastal taluks in Uttara Kannada have higher global solar radiation during summer (6.31\\xa0kWh/m2), monsoon (4.16\\xa0kWh/m2) and winter (5.48\\xa0kWh/m2). Mapping of regions suitable for tapping wind energy has been done based on wind velocity data, and it shows that Chikkodi taluk, Belgaum district, has higher potential during summer (6.06\\xa0m/s), monsoon (8.27\\xa0m/s) and winter (5.19\\xa0m/s). Mysore district has the maximum number of small hydropower plants with a capacity of 36\\xa0MW. Talukwise computation of bioenergy availability from agricultural residue, forest, horticulture, plantation and livestock indicates that Channagiri taluk in Shimoga district yields maximum bioenergy. The bioenergy status analysis shows that Siddapur taluk in Uttara Kannada district has the highest bioenergy status of 2.004 (ratio of bioresource availability and demand).'], ['Animals often behave in a profligate fashion and decimate the populations of plants and animals they depend upon. They may, however, evolve prudent behaviour under special conditions, namely when such prudence greatly enhances the success of populations that are not too prone to invasions by profligate individuals. Cultural evolution in human societies can also lead to the adoption of prudent practices under similar conditions. These are more likely to be realized in stable environments in which the human populations tend to grow close to the carrying capacity, when the human groups are closed, and when the technology is stagnant. These conditions probably prevailed in the hunter—gatherer societies of the tropics and subtropics, and led to the adoption of a number of socially imposed restraints on the use of plant and animal resources. Such practices were rationalized in the form of Nature-worship. The Indian caste society became so organized as to fulfill these conditions, and gave rise to two religions, Buddhism and Jainism, which emphasize compassion towards all forms of life. The pastoral nomads of the middle east, on the other hand, lived in an environment which militated against prudence, and these societies gave rise to religions like Christianity, which declared war on nature. As the ruling elite and state have grown in power, they have tried to wrest control of natural resources from the local communities. This has sometimes resulted in conservation and prudent use under guidance from the state, but has often led to conflicts with local populations to the detriment of prudent behaviour. Modern technological progress has also often removed the need for conservation, as when availability of coal permitted the deforestation of England. While modern scientific understanding has led to a better appreciation of the need for prudence, the prevailing social and economic conditions often militate against any implementation of the understanding, as is seen from the history of whaling. However, the imperative for survival of the poor from the Third-World countries may finally bring about conditions in which ecological prudence may once again come to dominate human cultures as it might once have done with stable societies of hunter—gatherers.'], ['High population pressure and the rapid pace of human activity including urbanization, industrialization and other economic activities have led to a dwindling supply of arable land per capita as well as water, especially ground water in underdeveloped countries. This has entailed considerable damage to the physical environment, including degradation and depletion of natural resources and unsustainable use of land and water resources. With the impact of climate change, the depletion of water resources will be faster both at the ground as well as the surface level due to rising temperatures in the region. This paper underscores the need for an eclectic approach to policy responses stemming from private and common property rights theories, externality theory and sustainability theory with a view to managing groundwater availability for the poor in terms of equity and sustainability in South Asia, China and Africa.'], ['Forest fires constitute one of the most serious environmental problems in several forested regions of India. In the Indian sub-continent, relatively few studies have focused on the assessment of biophysical and anthropogenic controls of forest fires at a landscape scale and the spatial aspects of these relationships. In this study, we used fire count data sets from satellite remote sensing data covering 78 districts over four different states of the Deccan Plateau, India, for assessing the underlying causes of fires. Spatial data for explanatory variables of fires pertaining to topography, vegetation, climate, anthropogenic and accessibility factors have been gathered corresponding with fire presence/absence. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the probability of the presence of fires as a function of the explanatory variables. Results for fire area estimates suggested that, of the total fires covering 47,043km2 that occurred during the year 2000 for the entire Indian region, 29.0% occurred in the Deccan Plateau, with Andhra Pradesh having 13.5%, Karnataka 14.7%, Kerala 0.1%, and Tamilnadu 1.15%. Results from the logistic regression suggest that the strongest influences on the fire occurrences were the amount of forest area, biomass densities, rural population density (PD), average precipitation of the warmest quarter, elevation (ELE) and mean annual temperature (MAT). Among these variables, biomass density (BD) and average precipitation of the warmest quarter had the highest significance, followed by others. These results on the best predictors of forest fires can be used both as a strategic planning tool to address broad scale fire risk concerns, and also as a tactical guide to help forest managers to design fire mitigation measures at the district level.'], [\"Prevailing dogma asserts that the uplift of Tibet, the onset of the Asian monsoon system and high biodiversity in southern Asia are linked, and that all occurred after 23 million years ago in the Neogene. Here, spanning the last 60 million years of Earth history, the geological, climatological and palaeontological evidence for this linkage is reviewed. The principal conclusions are that: 1) A proto-Tibetan highland existed well before the Neogene and that an Andean type topography with surface elevations of at least 4.5\\xa0km existed at the start of the Eocene, before final closure of the Tethys Ocean that separated India from Eurasia. 2) The Himalaya were formed not at the start of the India–Eurasia collision, but after much of Tibet had achieved its present elevation. The Himalaya built against a pre-existing proto-Tibetan highland and only projected above the average height of the plateau after approximately 15\\xa0Ma. 3) Monsoon climates have existed across southern Asia for the whole of the Cenozoic, and probably for a lot longer, but that they were of the kind generated by seasonal migrations of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone. 4) The projection of the High Himalaya above the Tibetan Plateau at about 15\\xa0Ma coincides with the development of the modern South Asia Monsoon. 5) The East Asia monsoon became established in its present form about the same time as a consequence of topographic changes in northern Tibet and elsewhere in Asia, the loss of moisture sources in the Asian interior and the development of a strong winter Siberian high as global temperatures declined. 6) New radiometric dates of palaeontological finds point to southern Asia's high biodiversity originating in the Paleogene, not the Neogene.\"], ['Rohitukine, a chromone alkaloid, has gained considerable international attention in recent years because of its novel semi-synthetic derivative, flavopiridol and P-276-00. Both these molecules are in advanced stages of clinical development and trial for cancer treatment. Recently, flavopiridol was approved as an orphan drug for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cancer. The natural occurrence of rohitukine is restricted to only four plant species, Amoora rohituka and Dysoxylum binectariferum (both from the Meliaceae family) and from Schumanniophyton magnificum and Schumanniophyton problematicum (both from the Rubiaceae family). Recently, an endophytic fungi isolated from D. binectariferum was reported to produce rohitukine in culture. In this study, we report the production of rohitukine and its subsequent attenuation by endophytic fungi, Fusarium oxysporum (MTCC-11383), Fusarium oxysporum (MTCC-11384) and Fusarium solani (MTCC-11385), all isolated from D. binectariferum and Gibberella fujikuroi (MTCC-11382) isolated from Amoora rohituka. The fungal rohitukine which was analyzed by HPLC, LC–MS and LC–MS/MS was identical to reference rohitukine and that produced by the plant. The rohitukine content in the mycelial samples ranged from 192.78\\xa0μg to 359.55\\xa0μg\\xa0100\\xa0g−1 of dry weight of and in broth it ranged from 14.10 to 71.90\\xa0μg\\xa0100\\xa0ml−1. In all the fungal cultures, the production declined from first to fourth sub-culture. Studies are underway to unravel the mechanism by which the fungi produce the host metabolite in culture.'], ['Camptothecine (Campothecin, CPT), a quinoline alkaloid, is a potent inhibitor of eukaryotic topoisomerase I. Several semi-synthetic derivatives of CPT are in clinical use against ovarian, small lung and refractory ovarian cancers. While CPT is produced by several plant species belonging to the Asterid clade, in recent years, efforts have been made to isolate endophytic fungi from some of these plants as possible alternative sources of CPT. In this study we report the isolation of three endophytic fungi from fruit and seed regions of Miquelia dentata (Icacinaceae), that produce CPT, 9-methoxy CPT (9-MeO-CPT) and 10-hydroxy CPT (10-OH-CPT). All the three fungi identified as, Fomitopsis sp. P. Karst (MTCC 10177), Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissl (MTCC 5477) and Phomposis sp. (Sacc.) produced CPT, 9-MeO-CPT and 10-OH-CPT in mycelial mats in shake flasks containing potato dextrose broth. Methanolic and ethyl acetate extracts of these fungal species were cytotoxic to colon and breast cancer cell lines. We discuss these results in the context of the recent interest in endophytic fungi as possible alternative sources of plant secondary metabolites.'], ['A new high-elevation scorpion species of the genus Scorpiops is described from the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. Scorpiops spitiensis sp. nov. is the second highest-elevation scorpion species in Asia and the first one from India occurring at elevations above 4200\\xa0m. The new species closely resembles Scorpiops petersii, but it can be distinguished from it based on a suit of characters, one of which is the presence of 16 trichobothria on the external aspect of the patella, which is unique to the new species.'], ['Forest fragments in agricultural landscapes are recognised to provide a variety of ecosystem services, several of which benefit neighbouring agricultural land uses. Pollination of crops is one such service that has attracted much research and public attention, yet the dependency of crops on pollinators, and the role of forest fragments in providing this service, remains contentious. Indeed, the trend towards increasing crop production through intensification is at odds with the expected concurrent decline in pollination. We investigated the combined effect of distance from forest and forest size on pollinator abundance at coffee agro-forests in Kodagu District, India, under two contrasting flowering scenarios: irrigation triggered flowering in a single agro-forest, and rain triggered flowering at all the remaining agro-forests that received rain but were not previously irrigated. Three social bee species, Apis dorsata, Apis cerana and Tetragonula iridipennis were the main flower visitors. In rain-fed agro-forests, the total visitor abundance at coffee flowers decreased with increasing distance to the nearest forest. When the three main pollinators were analysed separately, the abundances of A. dorsata and T. iridipennis decreased with increasing distance from a neighbouring forest patch but this distance effect was reduced with an increase in size of the nearby forest. An increase in pollinator abundance at coffee flowers increased coffee fruit set in rain-fed agro-forests. Irrigated agro-forests had far higher pollinator abundance and fruit set than rain-fed agro-forests. We attribute this to the small-scale staggered flowering of irrigated agro-forests resulting in the concentration of pollinators at these sites regardless of its proximity to forests or the size of nearby forest. Agro-forest shade tree species richness also negatively affected pollinator abundance in rain-fed agro-forests. Although our results show that distance to forest and size of neighbouring forest fragments do affect the abundance of pollinators at coffee, at least in rain-fed agro-forests, justifying the conservation of large forest remnants is problematic on this account as there was no direct effect of forest on coffee fruit set. This is likely to be because there remains a high density of forest remnants within Kodagu, and a threshold of forest cover at which crop fruit set begins to be affected by pollinator scarcity has yet to be reached. By controlling the timing of flowering through irrigation or managing domesticated bee hives, farmers effectively reduce the dependency on nearby forest cover for pollinator services irrespective of the distance between forests and agro-forests, but these management practices incur costs that not every farmer can cover.'], ['Increasing demands for non-timber forest products and their commercial extractions can result in harvesting methods that maximize short term economic gains with little attention to long term ecological consequences. We assessed the ecological impacts of harvesting techniques used by an indigenous group, the Soligas, on the non-timber forest products they extract from the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills, south India. Specifically, we examined patterns of resource availability of two non-timber tree species, Phyllanthus emblica and P. indofischeri, and how the current fruit harvesting techniques influence fruit yields, and susceptibility of trees to infestations by hemiparasitic plants of the Loranthaceae family. We also assessed how hemiparasite infestations affect fruit production and growth rates of Phyllanthus trees. There was considerable variation in fruit production in both species of Phyllanthus from one fruiting season to the next. The Soligas harvest an average of 86% (±17.72%) of the fruit yield on a per tree basis in P. emblica and 94.17% (±6.9%) in the case of P. indofischeri. At the population level, 64.75 and 86.6% of the fruit productivity is harvested in P. emblica and P. indofischeri, respectively. However, not all individuals or populations are harvested. Harvesting techniques used resulted in cutting of 15% of P. indofischeri trees and 5% of P. emblica trees. The current harvesting techniques used by the Soligas reduce fruit production in P. emblica in the following year (R2=0.27,p=0.03). Furthermore, the Soligas selectively harvest fruits from trees that have larger fruit crop sizes in both species. Individual trees that carried a greater load of hemiparasites produced significantly lower fruit yields (P. emblica: r=−0.32,p<0.013; P. indofischeri: r=−0.73,p<0.001). The presence of hemiparasites significantly affected the growth rates of trees.Current harvesting techniques used by the Soligas have negative impacts on trees of Phyllanthus spp., as do infestations by hemiparasites. Current fruit harvesting strategies and techniques used by the Soligas focus on maximizing the economic returns by adopting methods of extraction such as lopping of branches and cutting of trees. Such practices can ultimately decrease the rates at which the populations grow, thereby making the extraction of Phyllanthus fruits unsustainable. Adopting more sustainable methods of harvesting appears to be one viable solution to the current ecological problem facing the conservation of Phyllanthus trees in the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills.'], ['The long-term probability of soil moisture stress in rainfed crops was mapped at 0.5° resolution over the Krishna River basin in southern India (258,948\\xa0km2). Measurements of actual evapotranspiration (Ea) from 90 lysimeter experiments at four locations in the basin were used to calibrate a non-linear regression model that predicted the combined crop coefficient (KcKs) as a function of the ratio of seasonal precipitation (P) to potential evapotranspiration (Ep). Crops included sorghum, pulses (mung bean, chickpea, soybean, pigeonpea) and oilseeds (safflower and sunflower). Ep was calculated with the Penman–Monteith equation using net radiation derived from two methods: (1) a surface radiation budget calculated from satellite imagery (EpSRB) and (2) empirical equations that use data from meteorological stations (EpGBE). The model of Ks as a function P/Ep was combined with a gridded time series of precipitation (0.5° resolution, 1901–2000) and maps of EpSRB to define the probability distributions of P, P/Ep and Ks for sorghum at each 0.5° cell over the basin. Sorghum, a C4 crop, had higher Ea and Ks values than the C3 plants (oilseeds, pulses) when precipitation was low (P\\xa0<\\xa01\\xa0mm\\xa0d−1) but lower maximum Ea rates (3.3–4.5\\xa0mm\\xa0d−1) compared with C3 crops (oilseeds and pulses, 4.3–4.9\\xa0mm\\xa0d−1). The crop coefficient under adequate soil moisture (Kc) was higher than the FAO-56 crop coefficients by up to 56% for oilseeds and pulses. The seasonal soil moisture coefficient (Ks) for sorghum ranged from 1.0 under high rainfall (July–October) to 0.45 in dry seasons (November–March), showing strong soil moisture controls on Ea. EpSRB calculated at the lysimeter stations was 4–20% lower than EpGBE, with the largest difference in the dry season. Kc derived from EpSRB was only slightly (2–4%) higher than Kc derived from EpSRB, because the maximum Ea occurred during the monsoon when the differences between EpSRB and EpGBE were small. Approximately 20% of the basin area was expected to experience mild or greater soil moisture stress (Ks\\xa0<\\xa00.80) during the monsoon cropping season 1 year in every 2 years, while 70% of the basin experienced mild or greater stress 1 year in 10. The maps of soil moisture stress provide the basis for estimating the probability of drought and the benefits of supplemental irrigation.'], ['The community structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in the roots of drought-resistant trees, Moringa spp., was examined in semiarid regions in Madagascar and Uganda. Root samples were collected from 8 individuals of M. hildebrandtii and 2 individuals of M. drouhardii in Madagascar and from 21 individuals of M. oleifera in Uganda. Total DNA was extracted from the root samples, and partial nSSU rDNA of AM fungi was amplified using a universal eukaryotic primer NS31 and an AM fungalspecifi c primer AM1. The PCR products were cloned and divided by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with HinfI and RsaI. Some representatives in each RFLP types were sequenced, and a neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis was conducted for the obtained sequences with analogous sequences of AM fungi. The RFLP and phylogenetic analyses showed that AM fungi closely related to Glomus intraradices or G. sinuosum were detected in many samples. The AM fungal groups frequently detected in the Moringa spp. might be widely distributed species in semiarid environments.'], ['Forests with intensive management past are kept unmanaged to restore diversity and ecosystem functioning. Before perpetuating abandonment after protracted restitution, understanding its effect on forest vegetation is desirable. We studied plant diversity and its relation with environmental variables and stand structure in northern Indian unmanaged tropical moist deciduous forest. We hypothesized that post-abandonment species richness would have increased, and the structure of contemporary forest would be heterogeneous. Vegetation structure, composition, and diversity were recorded, in forty 0.1\\xa0ha plots selected randomly in four forest ranges. Three soil samples per 0.1\\xa0ha were assessed for physicochemistry, fine sand, and clay mineralogy. Contemporary forest had less species richness than pre-abandonment reference period. Fourteen species were recorded as either seedling or sapling, suggesting reappearance or immigration. For most species, regeneration was either absent or impaired. Ordination and multiple regression results showed that exchangeable base cations and phosphorous affected maximum tree diversity and structure variables. Significant correlations between soil moisture and temperature, and shrub layer was observed, besides tree layer correspondence with shrub richness, suggesting that dense overstory resulting from abandonment through its effect on soil conditions, is responsible for dense shrub layer. Herb layer diversity was negatively associated with tree layer and shrub overgrowth (i.e. Mallotus spp.). Protracted abandonment may not reinforce species richness and heterogeneity; perhaps result in high tree and shrub density in moist deciduous forests, which can impede immigrating or reappearing plant species establishment. This can be overcome by density/basal area reduction strategies, albeit for both tree and shrub layer.'], ['Thrissur, renowned as the cultural capital of Kerala is a city with a strong legacy of cultural, historic and traditional aspects.

Micro-hydro plants can convert the energy of falling water into electricity. In India, access to electricity cannot be taken for granted, especially in rural areas, which do not yet have grid extension or where it is too costly or infeasible. In these cases, micro-hydro plants are a welcome solution. Here I discuss the efforts of two non-governmental organizations, a private company, and a government agency, to facilitate micro-hydro projects in India, thereby increasing the socio-economic empowerment of rural inhabitants without electricity access. Based on extensive ethnographic data and constructivist conceptualizations of scale and consequences I find that these projects can indeed be described as “beautiful” technology interventions. In line with the common discourse on “small is beautiful,” the projects emphasize community engagement, control, and locality. Yet, importantly, they are “beautiful” in diverse ways. The actors set different priorities when implementing their small-scale technology interventions. Highlighting these priorities is important because they can empower people to acquire different roles, ranging from engaged consumers to prosumers. Instead of solely concentrating on the (small) scale of a technology I plead to consider the significance of implementing these interventions.'], ['The P-SV- and SH-wave field in the Talchir Basin is simulated along eight profiles: four profiles strike across the basin and the other four along the basin. The hybrid method, which combines two computational techniques, modal summation and finite differences, is used to produce multiphase synthetic seismograms. An M\\xa0=\\xa06 earthquake is considered, with hypocenter along the North Orissa Boundary Fault (NOBF) at a depth of 5\\xa0km and with the focal mechanism parameters: dip\\xa0=\\xa090°, strike\\xa0=\\xa0160° and rake\\xa0=\\xa0180°. The peak acceleration (AMAX) along each profile is determined considering the maximum acceleration obtained at the horizontal components. The response spectra ratio (RSR) as a function of frequency is computed for the eight profiles and the higher amplification is seen to increase in correspondence with the thicker sedimentary cover, especially for the radial component. Higher site amplification for all the profiles is observed in the frequency range from 0.5 to 1.4\\xa0Hz. To validate the obtained site-effects, the sources, for the profiles across the basin, are placed near to the southern end of the profile and the site amplifications are recomputed. Even if the spatial distribution of AMAX is mainly controlled by the epicentral distance, i.e. the geometrical spreading prevails on local soil effects, the RSR shows a pattern that can be easily correlated with the local site conditions. The RSR at the intersection of the profiles is dependent not only upon the local lithology and sediment thickness but also upon the epicentral distance. The Talchir Basin is classified into three zones based on the RSR values: low RSR zone (1.6–1.9), intermediate RSR zone (2.0–2.8) and high RSR zone (2.9–5.2). The PGA estimated for the bedrock model by Bhatia et al. (1999) for the study region is around 0.05 to 0.10\\xa0g while the Indian seismic zonation map estimated it to be in the range from 0.1 to 0.2\\xa0g. In the present study, that considers the effects of lateral variations in the structure, the PGA is estimated to be as high as 0.55\\xa0g along the BA profile.'], ['BackgroundKodagu is one of the tiniest districts in the Southern part of Karnataka (India). It is a habitat for more than ten different types of ethnic groups commonly called ‘Girijana’. An ethnomedicinal survey was undertaken in the tribal areas of the district to collect information from the traditional herbal healers on the use of medicinal plants in order to evaluate the potential medicinal uses of local plants used in curing various ailments.MethodsThe information was collected through conducting interviews, discussion and field observation with herbal healers and knowledgeable elder people of the study area using semi-structured questionnaire.ResultsThe survey reveals that the tribal people even today rely on traditional practice-knowledge inherited from generation to generation. It is evident that about 126 plant species belonging to 60 families are being used as ethnic drugs to cure various ailments viz., diabetes (32), skin disorder (22), diarrhoea (6), wound healing (17), intestinal worm (14), antidote for snake bite (13), jaundice (8) etc., respectively.ConclusionRecent trend shows a decline in the number of traditional herbal healers in the tribal areas since the younger generation is not interested to continue this tradition. Hence, there is an urgent need to record and preserve all information on plants used by different ethnic/tribal communities for various purposes before it is completely lost. In addition, several wild medicinal plants are declining in number due to deforestation and forest fires. There is need for phytochemical analysis and pharmacological investigations of these important disappearing plants to strengthen the documentation of ethnic drugs. It would help in developing novel drug(s) to treat chronic diseases.'], ['In this study, we explored the potential of multi-temporal IRS Wide Field Sensor (WiFS) data for mapping of vegetation cover types in India. A vegetation cover type map was generated from a hybrid approach (supervised and unsupervised) classification of 8–10\\xa0months IRS WiFS composite data (Raw bands, Max NDVI) over the period of 1998 to 1999. The study has identified 35 cover classes with a description of 22 vegetation cover including 14 forest cover types from 188\\xa0m spatial resolution WiFS data. India has a diverse range of forests: from the tropical evergreen in the south to the alpine meadows in the north, from the deserts in the west to the evergreen forests in the north-east and a diverse pattern of vegetation cover. More than half of the forest area in India is tropical-moist and dry-deciduous types distributed in central part. The WiFS vegetation cover map was compared to the estimates of forest cover area derived from IRS LISS III images (as per Forest Survey of India). There was a good agreement on spatial distribution and area of forest between the WiFS product and the LISS product, however, the WiFS product provided additional information on vegetation cover types and other land use/cover classes. Analysis of temporal NDVI profile allows identification of distinct growth pattern between the different vegetation cover types. It is evident that WiFS data can be used to provide timely and detailed vegetation cover type maps with limited ancillary data. The WiFS derived maps could be very useful as input to biogeochemical models that require timely estimation of forest area and type.'], ['To reduce the human influence on natural resources and to identify an appropriate land use, it is essential to carry out scientific land evaluations. Such kind of analysis allows identifying the main limiting factors for the agricultural production and enables decision makers to develop crop managements able to increase the land productivity. Objectives of this study were to develop a GIS based approach for land use suitability assessment which will assist land managers and land use planners to identify areas with physical constraints for a range of nominated land uses. Georeferenced soil survey data and field work observations have been integrated in a GIS based land use suitability assessment for agricultural planning in Chamarajanagar district, Karnataka, India. Also, GIS has been used to match the suitability for main crops based on the requirements of the crops and the quality and characteristics of land. Different land quality parameters, viz. soil texture, depth, erosion, slope, flooding and coarse fragments under various land units were evaluated for the crops. Subsequently all of them were integrated using a sequence of logical operations to generate land suitability and capability maps. Suitability and capability maps for each land use were developed to illustrate these suitability degrees and display the spatial representation of soils suitable for agriculture. It was also found that better land use options could be implemented in different land units as the conventional land evaluation methods suffer from limitation of spatial analysis for the suitability of various crops.'], ['Three themes in global mountain geomorphology have been defined and reinforced over the past decade: (a) new ways of measuring, sensing, and analyzing mountain morphology; (b) a new emphasis on disconnectivity in mountain geomorphology; and (c) the emergence of concerns about the increasing influence of anthropogenic disturbance of the mountain geomorphic environment, especially in intertropical mountains where population densities are higher than in any other mountain region. Anthropogenically induced hydroclimate change increases geomorphic hazards and risks but also provides new opportunities for mountain landscape enhancement. Each theme is considered with respect to the distinctiveness of mountain geomorphology and in relation to important advances in research over the past decade. The traditional reliance on the high energy condition to define mountain geomorphology seems less important than the presence of unique mountain landforms and landscapes and the distinctive ways in which human activity and anthropogenically induced hydroclimate change are transforming mountain landscapes.'], ['Ethnopharmacological relevanceSymplocos racemosa Roxb. belongs to a unigeneric family Symplocaceae, known as lodhra in Sanskrit; is a small evergreen tree, found throughout the tropical and sub-tropical countries.

The accessible literatures available on S. racemosa, were collected through electronic search on Pub med, Scopus, Science direct and traditional reports.ResultsS. racemosa is important Indian traditional drug used in many Ayurvedic and herbal formulations for treatment of liver as well as uterine disorders and leucorrhea. Majority of phytopharmacological reports are on stem bark of the plant which include anti-cancer, hepatoprotective, anti-oxidant, anti-androgenic effect, anti-inflammatory, wound healing activity and anti-diabetic effects. Phytochemical studies indicated presence of many phenolic glycosides like symplocoside, triterpenoids like betulinic acid, acetyloleanolic acid and oleanolic acid and flavonoids like quercetin which might have contributed to the observed protective effects.ConclusionMany ethnobotanical claims have been confirmed through systematic in-vitro and in-vivo pharmacological studies on different extracts of stem bark and isolated constituents. However, systematic studies on the bio-markers are desirable to establish mode of action and to validate the traditional claim in clinical practice after proper safety assessment. The conservation data of genus Symplocos showed risk of extinction due to restricted distribution in the wild hence systematic techniques should be developed for the maintenance of this plant.'], ['Human agglomerations in the coastal zone bring about unprecedented changes, the impacts of which are on the rise. A clear picture has emerged recently on the deterioration of the highly fragile and sensitive zone of the coastal ecosystem due to overexploitation of living and non-living resources. The formulation of “coastal regulation zones” (CRZ) in this context necessitates the proper management and conservation of these regions by identifying areas that require adequate attention for preservation and development. This paper critically reviews the planning and implementation of CRZ with emphasis on socio-economic aspects as well as traditional practices under Indian conditions. The study also incorporates management strategies for developing countries factually threatened by physical constraints and accelerated ecological changes.'], ['Environmental disasters and socio-ecological vulnerability associated with human capacity in any disaster affected region of the world is considered as a key factor in understanding the occurrence of environmental disasters, and consequently, in developing and applying adequate strategies for prevention. The identification of risks and the factors responsible for vulnerability are crucial in analysis and framing strategies for coping and adaptation to the situation. The present paper focuses on identification of potential indicators for disaster risk assessment, socio-economic and cultural vulnerability of local people while striving to cope with shocks of disaster and adaptation and coping strategies of people to mitigate the impact of disaster in Kedarnath valley of Uttarakhand. Based on the long term research and assessment of potential cost-effective bio-resources available locally, this article recommends some of the priority interventions and technology packages for the immediate implementation as well as capacity building of the community to make them economically sustainable and future-ready to respond swiftly towards such catastrophe with less negative impact. Only appropriate strategic framework and their implementation can sustain the human as well as biodiversity in the fragile Himalayan landscape.'], ['Estimating Acheulian group sizes based on a fragmentary archaeological record is fraught with difficulties, more so in regions like India, where lithics form the primary source of information. Here, we review current approaches towards modeling group size in Indian archaeology. We then examine to what extent one may address issues related to seasonality, fission-fusion strategies and group size in the context of Acheulian sites, drawing on our research along the southeastern coast of India. We move between multiple scales of analysis: from the regional Acheulian archaeological record to specific studies at the site of Attirampakkam (ATM). We consider aspects of site distribution, sizes, artefact densities and Acheulian lithic reduction strategies, factoring in issues related to geomorphology, taphonomy and chronology. Acheulian hominins occupied the study region over the early to middle Pleistocene, and the fragmented lithic reduction sequence noted on landscape scales suggests diverse site functions structured by ease of access to quartzite raw material for large flake production in addition to other resources. In contrast to most sites, the absence of raw material at ATM necessitated groups to anticipate this, and organize their behavior on landscape scales, and on-site, to resolve this issue. We show how successive groups were attracted to the site over the early Pleistocene, potentially aiming at exploiting seasonally predictable biological resources in a riparian environment, knowledge of which was transmitted across generations. Considerations of the spatial and temporal variability in artefact densities across a vast site area, along with aspects of the lithic reduction sequences suggests a short-duration occupation by a potentially large group, possibly resulting from aggregation of several small groups as noted in some ethnographic examples of hunter-gatherer fission-fusion strategies. We show drastic changes in behavioral organization in the succeeding Middle Palaeolithic phases at the site and in the region.'], ['Methods of calculating wildlife entanglement rates are not standardised between studies and often ignore the influence of observer effort, confounding comparisons. From 1997–2013 we identified 359 entangled Australian fur seals at Seal Rocks, south-eastern Australia. Most entanglement materials originated from commercial fisheries; most frequently entangling pups and juveniles. Using Generalized Additive Mixed Models, which incorporated observer effort and survey frequency, we identified that entanglements were observed more frequently amongst pups from July to October as they approached weaning. Neither the decline in regional fishing intensity nor changing seal population size influenced the incidence of entanglements. Using the models, we estimated that 302 (95% CI\\xa0=\\xa0182–510) entangled seals were at Seal Rocks each year, equivalent to 1.0% (CI\\xa0=\\xa00.6–1.7%) of the site population. This study highlights the influence of observer effort and the value of long-term datasets for determining the drivers of marine debris entanglements.'], ['ObjectiveTo assess antifungal activity of Ocimum sanctum leaves against dermatophytic fungi.MethodsAntifungal activity of Ocimum sanctum leaves was measured by 38 A NCCLS method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of various extracts and fractions of Ocimum sanctum leaves were also determined.ResultsOcimum sanctum leaves possessed antifungal activity against clinically isolated dermatophytes at the concentration of 200 μg/mL. MIC and MFC were high with water fraction (200 μg/mL) against dermatophytic fungi used.ConclusionsOcimum sanctum has antifungal activity, and the leaf extracts may be a useful source for dermatophytic infections.'], ['Tropical Asian Galliformes are secretive and difficult to survey. Many of these species are considered “at risk” due to habitat degradation although reliable density estimates are lacking. Using camera trapping and distance sampling data collected on the Siamese Fireback (Lophura diardi) in northeastern Thailand, we compared density estimates for pristine and degraded lowland forest. Density was poorly estimated using distance sampling, likely due to small sample size arising from poor visibility in dense vegetation and bird’s sensitivity to observers. We analysed camera trap data using both count-based and presence/absence-based methods. Those density estimates had narrower confidence intervals than those obtained using distance sampling. Estimated density was higher in dry evergreen forest (5.6\\xa0birds\\xa0km−2), than in old forest plantations (0.2\\xa0birds\\xa0km−2), perhaps because dense forest habitats provide Firebacks with more resources and refuge from predation. Our results suggest that camera trap data can be used for estimating density of cryptic terrestrial bird species inhabiting tropical forest that lack unique identification markings. However, this technique requires that the effective sampling area is known and thus requires knowledge of the animal home range size.'], ['We assessed variation in avifaunal diversity at some selected habitats around the Negombo estuary in Sri Lanka in relation to land-use modifications. During the study period, we observed 48 bird species of which 47 species are residents to Sri Lanka. The avian species richness, evenness, and heterogeneity were found to be the highest at undisturbed habitats. Further, these diversity measures were negatively correlated with the intensity of anthropogenic land-use activities. Total abundance of birds increased at highly disturbed habitats due to the presence of the house crow, as it is the most abundant of all birds observed at these habitats. This study highlights the need for habitat management around estuaries, giving due consideration to existing ecological theories to conserve avifaunal diversity. It also highlights the negative impacts of the house crow on diversity of other resident avian fauna in these habitats.'], ['Forest fragmentation is continued to be widespread in the tropics resulting in reduced ecosystem services including carbon storage. However, the effect of forest fragmentation is not considered in the current carbon policy. We investigated the effect of forest fragmentation on tree biomass carbon and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in a moist tropical forest in Bangladesh. Above and below-ground tree biomass carbon were calculated by using widely accepted allometric equations and SOC was measured by sampling soils up to 10\\xa0cm depth and analyzing them in a soil laboratory. Results showed that carbon storage in tree biomass was significantly lower in fragmented forests (16.3\\xa0±\\xa01.37\\xa0t\\xa0C\\xa0ha−1) than in contiguous forests (31.21\\xa0±\\xa02.75\\xa0t\\xa0C\\xa0ha−1) (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). Likewise, a significantly lower SOC was contained in the soils of fragmented forests (17.26\\xa0±\\xa00.83\\xa0t\\xa0C\\xa0ha−1) than in contiguous forests (21.62\\xa0±\\xa00.78\\xa0t\\xa0C\\xa0ha−1) (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). Thus a total of 36% less carbon retained in tree biomass and soils in fragmented forests than in contiguous forests. Backward multiple linear regression analysis revealed tree density, tree height, tree DBH, height-diameter ratio (H/D) and tree species richness as influential factors of carbon variation in fragmented forests. All these structural parameters except tree species richness were significantly lower in fragmented forests, were positively associated with carbon storage and explained together 69% of the carbon storage variation. These findings suggest that the altered stand structure and tree allometry likely caused reduced carbon storage in fragmented forests and highlight the importance of landscape scale management intervention in the tropics. Here, we provided with the evidence of strong negative impact of forest fragmentation on carbon storage and argue that this effect should be in consideration which is currently overlooked in existing carbon accounting systems for tropical forests.'], ['A study has been made of the population ecology of large mammals of Silent Valley and contiguous forests of South India. The vegetation of Silent Valley and Attapadi forests are mostly west coast tropical evergreen and semi-evergreen types. In the adjoining forests Nilambur and Nilgiris, the vegetation is southern secondary moist mixed deciduous and southern montane wet temperature, respectively. Silent Valley and its contiguous forests harbour 25 species of large and medium-sized mammals, including two endangered endemic species and many others that are endangered and protected. The lion-tailed macaque, Nilgiri tahr and tiger were sighted in and around the submergence area of the proposed Silent Valley hydroelectric project. If constructed, the impact of this dam on the populations of larger mammals in the area would be severe.'], ['ng evidence highlights the role that botanic gardens might have in plant invasions across the globe. Botanic gardens, often in global biodiversity hotspots, have been implicated in the early cultivation and/or introduction of most environmental weeds listed by IUCN as among the worst invasive species worldwide. Furthermore, most of the popular ornamental species in living collections around the globe have records as alien weeds. Voluntary codes of conduct to prevent the dissemination of invasive plants from botanic gardens have had limited uptake, with few risk assessments undertaken of individual living collections. A stronger global networking of botanic gardens to tackle biological invasions involving public outreach, information sharing and capacity building is a priority to prevent the problems of the past occurring in the future.'], ['Whereas in all other vertebrates the Müllerian ducts of genetic males are aborted during development, under the influence of Müllerian-inhibiting substance, in the caecilian amphibians they are retained as a pair of functional glands. It has long been speculated that the Müllerian gland might be the male accessory reproductive gland but there has been no direct evidence to this effect. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the caecilian Müllerian gland secretory proteins would bear antigenic similarity to secretory proteins of the prostate gland and/or the seminal vesicles of a mammal. The secretory proteins of the Müllerian gland of Ichthyophis tricolor were evaluated for cross-reactivity with antisera raised against rat ventral prostate and seminal vesicle secretory proteins, adopting SDS-PAGE, two-dimensional electrophoresis and immunoblot techniques. Indeed there was a cross-reaction of five Müllerian gland secretory protein fractions with prostatic protein antiserum and of three with seminal vesicle protein antiserum. A potential homology exists because in mammals the middle group of the prostate primordia is derived from a diverticulum of the Müllerian duct. Thus this study, by providing evidence for expression of prostatic and seminal vesicle proteins in the Müllerian gland, substantiates the point that in caecilians the Müllerian glands are the male accessory reproductive glands.'], ['Biodiesel from non-edible vegetable oil seems to be a promising alternate for petro-diesel in the present energy scenario. This study analyses the experimental and theoretical effects on the blends of Bee Wax biodiesel with straight diesel on combustion parameters. A zero-dimensional mathematical model is developed to analyse the rise in in-cylinder pressure along with Wiebie’s heat release correlations, ignition delay, gas dynamics model, heat transfer model and frictional model. The combustion parameters include in-cylinder pressure rise, net heat release and rate of pressure rise are investigated and found to be higher for straight diesel and deteriorated with the increase in blends of BWB. The theoretical simulation also supports the experimental data with constant injection timing, speed and compression ratio.'], ['The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial, anti-oxidant and anthelmintic potential of extracts of the herb Solanum xanthocarpum. The antimicrobial activity was tested against selected bacterial and fungal species by agar well diffusion method and the antioxidant activity was assessed using FRAP and reducing power scavenging assays. While that of anthelmintic activity was performed against the erthworms. The FRAP assay evaluates the ability of a substance to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+. Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed the presence of saponins; phytosterols and carbohydrates in the plant.'], ['India’s growing population and economy generate an increasing demand for energy. Facing the decline of global fossil fuel resources, the Indian government and energy industry are considering the long-term expansion of biofuel production in order to increase energy security. This development leads to a strong competition of energy crops versus food crops for land and may result in an increasing pressure on natural resources. In a pilot scenario study, the LandSHIFT model is applied to assess the impact of biofuel production on land-use change in India up to the year 2030. The model aims at the spatially explicit simulation of land-use change and its relation to other global change processes on the national up to the global scale. It explicitly addresses competition between land-use activities such as human settlement, biofuel production and food production as well as the resulting effects on the spatial extent of natural land. Baseline of the study is a simulation with drivers from the “Order from Strength” scenario of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. To illustrate the consequences of expanded biofuel production for the extent of natural land, we calculate three scenarios of bioethanol production to substitute 5%, 10% and 20% of the expected petrol demand in 2030. In the simulations shown, a comprehensive linkage is made between driving forces (such as population change) and policies (such as biofuel usage) that will affect land-use change over the coming decades.'], [\"The goal of this study was to test whether body-mass based foraging principles, guided by plant available moisture (PAM) and plant available nutrients (PAN), could explain large mammalian herbivore species distribution and richness in India. We tested (1) whether the occurrence of larger-bodied herbivore species increases with PAM, but is independent of PAN, (2) whether the occurrence of smaller-bodied herbivore species decreases with PAM, but increases with PAN, and (3) whether herbivore species richness is highest in areas with intermediate PAM and high PAN. We analyzed the distribution and richness of the 16 large (>10\\xa0kg) herbivore species found in sub-Himalayan mainland India. Since the distributions of large herbivores in India have been altered by historic human activity, we only used India's largest 76 protected areas as data points, with respect to PAM (log10(rainfall/potential evapotranspiration)), PAN (soil cation exchange capacity), elevation, tree cover, and fire frequency. Using regression and null models to analyze the data, we found positive relations between PAM and the occurrences of the larger-bodied species (elephant and gaur), and negative relations between PAM and the occurrences of smaller-bodied species (chinkara, four-horned antelope and blackbuck). We also found positive relations between the occurrence of the smaller-bodied species and PAN. Large herbivore species richness in India is highest in Kanha and Indravati, areas with high PAN and intermediate PAM. We found that elevation, tree cover and fire frequency were insignificant predictors of herbivore species richness, although elevation and tree cover explained the distribution of a few species. Based on our null model analyses results, we conclude that moisture and soil nutrients are important in determining large herbivore species distribution and richness in sub-Himalayan India.\"], ['Upland grasslands in South Africa occur in climates warm enough and wet enough for forests yet, unlike savannas, trees are absent. We hypothesize that the lack of trees in grasslands is due to the scarcity of gaps suitable for tree seedling establishment in the grass root layer. We assessed which demographic bottlenecks, seedling recruitment or sapling release, were limiting large tree populations of Acacia species in 229 sites on a gradient from lowland savannas to upland grasslands in eastern South Africa. We explored the frequency of ‘root gaps’ by quantifying grass root biomass in grids of 18 points at six sites distributed from lowland savannas to upland grasslands.Across the altitudinal gradient, sapling release was the most common bottleneck at low elevation sites switching to seedling recruitment in upland savannas and adjacent grasslands. Root studies showed grass root biomass at upland sites to be double than that of lowland sites. When grass root biomass of all 108 sample points was ranked, lowland savanna sites had the most frequent ‘gaps’ defined as the lowest percentiles of values (5, 15, 25, 35, 45). The number of ‘gaps’ decreased along the elevation gradient with none in the grassland site. Dense grass roots may prevent seedling establishment and ‘root gaps’ may be safe sites with reduced competition where seedlings can establish. We suggest that a lack of root gaps could explain the treeless nature of many upland grasslands.'], ['The search for diverse plant growth-promoting diazotrophic bacteria is gaining momentum as efforts are made to exploit them as bioinoculants for various crops. In particular, the use of strains with multiple plant growth promoting properties would help to increase crop productivity on a sustainable basis. This study investigated the effects of plant growth promoting potential of diazotrophs isolated from rhizosphere of semi-arid tropical grasses and evaluated their inoculation effects on the growth of rice plants under in vitro and in vivo conditions. The diazotrophic isolates from grass species were characterized for nitrogenase activity by acetylene reduction assay (ARA) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The ARA activity of the isolates ranged from 50.83 to 172.25\\xa0nmol\\xa0ethylene/mg\\xa0protein/h and the putative diazotrophs from rhizosphere of grass species were identified by nifH gene amplification. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis identified the isolates as belonging to class of alpha Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Plant growth promoting traits of all the selected diazotrophic isolates were analysed and results revealed that the diazotrophs were found to produce phytohormone, siderophores, HCN, solubilized minerals such as P, K and Zn. Diazotrophs also produced enzyme such as ACC deaminase that can modulate plant growth and development. Based on the presence of multiple plant growth promoting traits, the isolates were selected for inoculation studies. In gnotobiotic experiment, inoculation of diazotrophic isolates significantly improves the growth of rice. In the field experiment, Serratia sp. (CB2) and K. pneumoniae (CR3) treated plots, grain yields were recorded more by 31 and 28%, respectively, over yield obtained using full doses of fertilizers. This trait of improving growth parameters and yield of rice indicates that the diazotrophs isolated from grass species can be utilized as bioinoculant for rice.'], [\"The proposed Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC) is an ambitious effort to stem the erosion of biodiversity in one of the world's biologically richest regions. The intent is to connect large existing parks and reserves with new protected areas by means of an extensive network of biological corridors within Mesoamerica/Central America to create an environment which provides better prospects for the long-term survival of native species while also addressing the region's socioeconomic needs. While the forest types in northern Central America generally receive some dry season rainfall, in the proposed protected regions, however, it is unclear whether current rainfall has been altered by regional land-use change.Based upon climatological rainfall records at 266 stations in Guatemala and adjacent areas, dry season rainfall in March is markedly lower in deforested areas than in forested areas of the same life zone for each of the widespread life zones. In general, dry season deforested habitats have higher daytime temperatures, are less cloudy, have lower estimated soil moisture and lower values of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) than do forested habitats in the same life zone. The result is hotter and drier air over deforested regions, with lower values of cloud formation and precipitation. Rainfall is predicted from the correlation of raingauge measurements and observed cloud cover; moreover, March rainfall deficiencies >\\xa025\\xa0mm are found for several Holdridge life zones. The data suggest that deforestation is locally intensifying the dry season, increasing the risk of fire, especially for the long corridor connecting regions. In addition, forest regeneration in some parts of the MBC may not result in second-growth forest that is characteristic of that life zone but rather in forest regeneration more typical of drier conditions. The extent to which this would influence the conservation utility of any given corridor depends upon the ecological requirements of the organisms concerned.\"], ['Logging is one of the most pervasive threats to biodiversity in tropical forests. In this study, we concurrently examined the responses of the avian frugivore community and the community of fruiting trees to past logging in a tropical forest in northeastern India. We predicted that the abundance of, and visitation by large-bodied frugivores would be lower in logged forests, resulting in reduced seed dispersal and recruitment of biotically dispersed species (especially large-seeded species). Data were collected from two logged and unlogged sites using (a) belt transects for estimating avian frugivore abundance (b) fruiting tree watches to quantify frugivore visitation and (c) vegetation plots to characterize recruitment. Our results show that differences in the abundance of bird species between logged and unlogged sites was correlated with body mass, with larger species being scarcer and smaller species more abundant in logged areas. Correspondingly, visitation rates by large avian frugivores was lower in logged compared with unlogged sites. Finally, biotically dispersed tree species, especially large-seeded species, had lower recruitment in logged forests, potentially due to lowered visitation rates and decreased fruit removal by large bodied avian frugivores. In the long term, these differences in recruitment may result in a tree community shift towards small-seeded biotically dispersed species and abiotically dispersed species in logged areas.'], ['The market for ornamental plants is growing every year, becoming an important part of the economy. Every year hundreds of new cultivars, replacing the current assortment, are produced. However, since consumer preferences are changing rapidly, the cultivars considered old-fashioned today may become popular once again. They are also a valuable breeding material source. Bearing that in mind, there is a great need to develop a strategy for their long-term conservation. Storage in gene banks under in vitro cultures, although offering many advantages, is expensive and threatened with somaclonal variation and contamination loss. Cryopreservation is believed to be a more promising method. It has been successfully used with many agricultural species. Unlike micropropagation, cryopreservation has not yet found wider employment with ornamental plants. The upcoming years and progress in cryobiology may, however, change this situation and broaden the potential of cryoconservation. Over years several freezing methods have been introduced. The first one developed, based on slow cooling, had limited usefulness in temperate species. Today the encapsulation-dehydration technique is most often used with ornamental plants. In the future, however, combined techniques will probably be the most popular. So far insufficient attention has been paid to the problem of the genetic stability of cryopreserved ornamental species, especially chimeras. The aim of this paper is to present different cryopreservation techniques and their use for the storage, protection and breeding of ornamental plants.'], ['In the rare perennial bodies of water of the Sahara desert, only a few fish species have survived to increasing aridification since the end of the last humid period at the Holocene, approximately 5000 years BP. Here, I report the occurrence of an undescribed haplochomine cichlid fish in Lake Boukou, one of the seven Ounianga Serir lakes (Chad). These lakes are located in one of the most arid areas of the Sahara desert, but they persist by virtue of subsurface inflow of fresh groundwater from a large fossil aquifer. Astatotilapia tchadensis sp. nov. is characterized by a black bar between eye and corner of mouth, rounded orange spots on anal fin, scales ctenoid, lower limb of first gill arch with 7–8 gill rackers, dorsal fin with 13–14 spines and 9–11 soft rays, anal fin with 3 spines and 8–9 soft rays, 29 or 30 lateral line scales, and lower pharyngeal dentition with enlarged molariform teeth. The new species is easily distinguished from A.\\xa0desfontainii and A.\\xa0flaviijosephii, the northernmost haplochromine species currently isolated from its other group members, and appears close to an unnamed species of Lake Chad basin. Ounianga Serir lakes and especially Lake Boukou present a remarkable diversity of fish, the highest known in the Sahara desert with a total of at least six fish species belonging to six genera and three families. They also constitute an exceptional natural landscape inscribed on the UNESCO world heritage list in 2012 and a biodiversity hotspot for desert vertebrate species.'], ['The present study develops the highly reliable and reproducible protocol for indirect organogenesis of Helicteres isora L., a medicinally important multipurpose plant of Sterculiaceae family.

This is the first ethnobotanical study in which statistical calculations about plants are done by the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) method. The present study was aimed to identify plants collected for medicinal purposes by the traditional healers of Nelliyampathy hills, located in Palakkad district of Kerala, India and to document the traditional names, preparation and uses of these plants.MethodsThe field study was carried out over a period of 2 years (2011–2013) using semi-structured interviews with 66 informants (most of the informants belonged to an age between 50 and 70 years) in six remote locations in the hills. Ethnomedicinal data was analyzed using frequency citation (FC), relative frequency of citation (RFC) and use value (UV) along with a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Demographic characteristics of participants, ethnobotanical inventory of plants and data on medicinal application and administration were recorded.ResultsA total of 85 medicinal plants belonging to 49 families were reported to be used against 19 different ailments in the hills. The maximum reported medicinal plant families were Cucurbitaceae with 6 species followed by Acanthaceae, Malvaceae and Fabaceae (each 5 species), Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, Moraceae and Myrtaceae (each 3 species), the most dominant life form of the species includes herbs (42) followed by tree (20), climber (15) and shrub (8), the most frequent used part was leaves (40%) followed by root (14%), seed and flowers (each12%), fruit (9%), bark (7%), stem (2%), latex (2%), rhizome and whole plant (each 1%), the most common preparation and administration methods were paste (32%), powder (22%), decoction and juice (each 20%) and raw (4%), infusion and inhalation (each1% ). The Pearson correlation coefficient between RFC and UV was 0.638 showing highly positive significant association.ConclusionsIn this study, we have documented considerable indigenous knowledge about the native medicinal plants in Nelliyampathy hills for treating common ailments. The plants such as further investigated phytochemically and pharmacologically which leads to natural drug discovery development may be based on the present study.

It has a center of diversity in North America with only a few species occurring in Asia. This study focuses on the Asian Spiranthes with an emphasis on understanding their biogeographic relationships and species delimitations using molecular markers. Our phylogenetic trees based on nuclear (ITS) and chloroplast (trnL-trnLF, matK and trnS-G) sequences from samples across their range in Asia revealed the Asian Spiranthes are monophyletic. Ancestral area optimization suggested that North America forms the ancestral region for the Asian Spiranthes rather than Europe suggesting that they originated from a single long-distance dispersal event. Our study also revealed the presence of a cryptic species S. himalayensis, which was discovered based on molecular data thus emphasizing the importance of wide geographical sampling in phylogenetic studies. Sequences of cloned ITS provided support for the hypothesis that natural hybridization between S. sinensis and the newly described S. himalayensis resulted in the allotetraploid S. hongkongensis, with S. himalayensis as the paternal parent. One of the species complexes known in Asia is the S. sinensis complex, which shows a wide occurrence and is known for local geographical variants. Some of these variants have been described as new species in Australia and New Zealand. Our studies show that all the sampled variants including the Australian and New Zealand species show monophyly despite having long branches. This suggests that there may be high rates of gene flow between the geographically distinct forms resulting in lack of species resolution within the S. sinensis complex.'], [\"Indian tropical deciduous forest due to higher species richness, irregular stem densities and stem cover, multistoried canopy and microclimate, offers dynamism to the understanding of the spatial patters in aboveground biomass (AGB) and carbon (AGBC) within different plant functional types (PFTs). Field-based AGB and AGBC estimates are vital for carbon cycle study and provide inputs for data-deficit regional and global carbon and climate models.In this paper we generated the primary baseline data on tree composition, species richness (SR), AGB and AGBC gathered from nine 10,000\\xa0m2 long-term ecological research (LTER) plots in three distinct PFTs {dry mixed (DM), sal mixed (SM) and teak plantation (TP)} within an Indian tropical deciduous forest along Himalayan foothills during 2009–2012. The functional relationship of PFT structural attributes i.e. SR, density, basal cover, leaf area index and litter fall on AGB was investigated. PCA was applied to study the relationship between PFT microclimate, structural attributes and diversity vs. AGB.A total of 22, 22 and 6 tree species were found in DM, SM and TP PFT, respectively. Shannon's diversity index was highest (2.46) in DM, whereas Simpson's dominance index was maximum (0.85) in TP. AGB (Mg\\xa0ha−1) ranged from 290.82–455.99 among all PFTs.

Using field visits, interviews with locals and experts, and literature reviews, we explored a successful programme of community-based groundwater recharge in three adjacent catchments (the Arvari, Sarsa and Baghani) in semi-arid north Rajasthan, India, led by the NGO Tarun Bharat Sangh (TBS) in order to determine how successes were achieved and could be replicated. TBS-led initiatives rebuilt traditional village governance structures and participation in community-designed and maintained water harvesting structures (WHSs), which were efficient both economically and in technical design using indigenous knowledge. Enhanced seasonal groundwater recharge enabled by WHSs regenerated aquatic, farmed and natural ecosystems, underpinning a positive cycle of interdependent social and economic regeneration. Locally appropriate, integrated social and technical solutions maintaining this positive cycle have increased the quality of ecosystems and the wellbeing of local people. We used the STEEP (Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political) framework to stratify outcomes, exploring principles underpinning successful local and catchment-scale regeneration and drawing out lessons transferrable to similarly water-stressed regions.'], ['ObjectiveTo determine the minerals, Iron (Fe), Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Manganese (Mn) and trace elements, Lead (Pb), Copper (Cu), Cadmium (Cd) and Zinc (Zn) in two tropical medicinal plants (Syzygium caryophyllatum and Syzygium densiflorum).MethodsAll the elements were determined by using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS).ResultsThe average concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Pb and Cd detected in leaves of Syzygium caryophyllatum and Syzygium densiflorum were 99.275±0.022, 17.302±0.010, 45.498±0.072, 47.344±0.021, 7.634±0.050, 0.253±0.003 and 93.829±0.015, 17.412±0.064, 64.866±0.058, 31.777±0.051, 6.768±0.010 and 0.343±0.004, respectively.ConclusionsThe mineral contents in the medicinal plants are at different levels.

Among the fourteen generic names published previously, only eight are validly published and the rest are nomenclaturally illegitimate. About 51 species were reported under these genera to date. There is a gradual increase of species diversity of fossil wood from the Triassic to Early Cretaceous. The nature of the growth rings was applied to understand the palaeoclimate. The lack of distinct growth rings in the Triassic woods suggests absence of seasonality. The Jurassic woods with an inconsistency in growth rings and presence of growth interruptions suggest climate was seasonal and turbulent. During the Early Cretaceous, conifer dominated vegetation and with wider growth rings and gradual transition suggests warm environments with pronounced seasonality. The general increase in mean ring width from the Triassic to Early Cretaceous indicates ameliorating climatic conditions, particularly benign summer conditions.'], ['Spilanthes ciliata (S. ciliata) is a perennial herb of global importance owing to its luscious source of bioactive fatty acid derived amides known as N-alkylamides. It finds application in skin creams, mouth gels and toothpastes. Despite multifaceted applications, a major limitation associated for its commercial application is the scarcity of contamination free plant source, fluctuations in active metabolites due to variation in extraction procedures, and lack of rapid qualitative method for alkylamide profiling. In the current work, attempts were made to 1) optimize conditions for mass propagation of contamination free plants of S. ciliata by tissue culture using leaf discs as explants, 2) establish an optimum extraction ratio of plant/solvent (w/v) for maximum elution of alkylamides and 3) develop a rapid method for qualitative estimation of alkylamide from in vitro raised plants in comparison with that of the field grown counterpart by using LC-Q-TOF (HRMS). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first qualitative report on alkylamide profile of micropropagated whole plant of Spilanthes. The correlation pattern reported in this study may form the basis for using tissue culture raised plantlets of S. ciliata as potential source of bioactive alkylamides on industrial scale.'], [\"Empirical research provides contradictory evidence of the loss of traditional ecological knowledge across societies. Researchers have argued that culture, methodological differences, and site-specific conditions are responsible for such contradictory evidences. We advance and test a third explanation: the adaptive nature of traditional ecological knowledge systems. Specifically, we test whether different domains of traditional ecological knowledge experience different secular changes and analyze trends in the context of other changes in livelihoods. We use data collected among 651 Tsimane' men (Bolivian Amazon). Our findings indicate that different domains of knowledge follow different secular trends. Among the domains of knowledge analyzed, medicinal knowledge and wild edible knowledge appear as the most vulnerable; canoe building knowledge and firewood knowledge seem to remain constant across generations; whereas house building knowledge seems to experience a slight secular increase. Our analysis reflects on the adaptive nature of traditional ecological knowledge, highlighting how changes in this knowledge system respond to the particular needs of a society in a given point of time.\"], ['Black pepper, popularly known as the “King of Spices”, has a very checkered history dating back to the times of Queen Sheeba and King Solomon (BC 1015–BC 66) and has influenced the destiny of nations and their people, spread across the world, both economically and culturally. Today pepper commands the leading position among the different spices as the spice of immense commercial importance in world trade and is finding its way into the dietary habits of millions around the world, even among people on the European and North American continents, hitherto unaccustomed to its use. Pepper use ranges from a simple dietary constituent to that of immense pharmacological benefits. Though beset with many problems, both agronomic and economic, it is a safe bet that pepper will emerge as the world’s most sought after spice, its predicted global demand escalating colossally to about 280,000 metric tons by the year 2020 that will further climb to 360,000 metric tons by the year 2050. This very exhaustive review details the various constraints to enhancing productivity of pepper and charts contours of a new course of action. Among the primary constraints in pepper production is the absence of an ideotype that combines many positive traits to boost production potential, whilst at the same time resisting ravages of nature such as the onslaught of the dreaded disease “Foot Rot” caused by Phytophthora fungi, whch is the most devastating. Fertility management of pepper soils is still rooted in classical “text book” knowledge. The review also includes the relevance of a refreshing new concept, developed by the author, which is now universally known as “the nutrient buffer power concept”, in enhancing pepper productivity.'], ['This work evaluates the impact of climate change on the water balance of a catchment in India. Rainfall and hydro-meteorological variables for current (20C3M scenario, 1981–2000) and two future time periods: mid of the 21st century (2046–2065) and end of the century (2081–2100) are simulated using Modified Markov Model-Kernel Density Estimation (MMM-KDE) and k-nearest neighbor downscaling models. Climate projections from an ensemble of 5 GCMs (MPI-ECHAM5, BCCR-BCM2.0, CSIRO-mk3.5, IPSL-CM4, and MRI-CGCM2) are used in this study. Hydrologic simulations for the current as well as future climate scenarios are carried out using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) integrated with ArcGIS (ArcSWAT v.2009). The results show marginal reduction in runoff ratio, annual streamflow and groundwater recharge towards the end of the century. Increased temperature and evapotranspiration project an increase in the irrigation demand towards the end of the century. Rainfall projections for the future shows marginal increase in the annual average rainfall. Short and moderate wet spells are projected to decrease, whereas short and moderate dry spells are projected to increase in the future. Projected reduction in streamflow and groundwater recharge along with the increase in irrigation demand is likely to aggravate the water stress in the region under the future scenario.'], ['ation of alternative energy technologies such as biogas in various parts of the world has rarely led to a success rate of 90%. This study in Sirsi block, Karnataka, south India, revealed that 43% of rural households (HH) had dung resources to operate biogas plants and 65% of them had already built biogas plants. 100% of the plants built were functioning satisfactorily and 85% of HH with biogas plants met all their cooking energy needs with biogas, improving the quality of life of women. The presence of multiple agencies in the dissemination network, participation of entrepreneurs competing to assist households in all aspects of biogas plant construction, commissioning, procuring subsidy, guaranteed performance and free servicing contributed to the high rate of success (of 100% of biogas plants being functional). Most biogas plants built had excess plant capacity, with cost implications. An observed shift in the design choice from mild steel floating drum design to fibre reinforced plastic-based floating drum design and then to a less expensive fixed dome model shows that rural households respond quickly to technological developments.

It has been reported from four species, belonging to the families, Meliaceae and Rubiaceae. Stem bark of Dysoxylum binectariferum (Meliaceae) accumulates the highest amount of rohitukine (3–7% by dry weight). In this study, we examine the spatial and temporal distribution of rohitukine and related compounds during various stages of seed development in D. binectariferum using desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI MSI). Rohitukine (m/z 306.2) accumulation increased from early seed development to seed maturity stage. The spatial distribution of rohitukine was largely restricted to the cotyledonary tissue followed by the embryo and least in the seed coat. Besides rohitukine, rohitukine acetate (m/z 348.2) and glycosylated rohitukine (m/z 468.2) were also detected, both through mass fragmentation and exact mass analysis through Orbitrap mass spectrometry. These results indicate a dynamic pattern of chromane alkaloid accumulation through seed development in D. binectariferum.'], ['The competence of the living creatures to sense and respond to light is well known.

Current study provides significant ethnopharmacological information, both qualitative and quantitative on medical plants in Rangamati.Aim of the studyThis study aimed to collect, analyze and evaluate the rich ethnopharmacologic knowledge on medicinal plants in Rangamati and attempted to identify the important species used in traditional medicine. Further analysis was done by comparison of the traditional medicinal use with the available scientific literature data.Materials and methodsThe field survey was carried out in a period of about one year in Rangamati, Bangladesh. A total of 152 people were interviewed, including Traditional Health Practitioners (THPs) and indigenous people through open-ended and semistructured questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. This ethnomedicinal knowledge was compared against the literature for reports of related uses and studies of phytochemical compounds responsible for respective ailments.ResultsA total of 144 species of plants, mostly trees, belonging to 52 families were identified for the treatment of more than 90 types of ailments. These ailments were categorized into 25 categories. Leaves were the most frequently used plant parts and decoction is the mode of preparation of major portions of the plant species. The most common mode of administration was oral ingestion and topical application. Informant consensus factor (Fic) values of the present study reflected the high agreement in the use of plants in the treatment of gastro-intestinal complaints and respiratory problems among the informants. Gastro-intestinal complaint had highest use-reports and 3 species of plants, namely Aegle marmelos (L.) Corr., Ananas comosus (L.) Merr., and Terminalia chebula (Gaertn.) Retz., had the highest fidelity level (FL) of 100%. Asparagus racemosus Willd. and Azadirachta indica A. Juss. showed the highest relative importance (RI) value of 1.86. According to use value (UV) the most important species were Azadirachta indica A. Juss. (2.48) and Ocimum sanctum L.

We sampled deeply among tropical Asian, and especially South Asian, taxa and used a multi-gene approach to establish the affinities of Indian and Sri Lankan Hemidactylus and to evaluate the monophyly of previously proposed taxa within the genus. There is only weak support for the monophyly of tropical Asian Hemidactylus as a whole, but two strongly supported subclades were retrieved: the bowringii group is a predominantly East Asian clade that reaches South Asia only peripherally; the brookii group is a morphologically diverse clade that represents a previously unrecognized, species-rich (25 species), chiefly South Asian radiation. Deep genetic divergences support the specific recognition of three Sri Lankan taxa previously regarded as subspecies of mainland forms and validate H. subtriedrus as a species distinct from H. triedrus. Unlike several other vertebrate groups, Sri Lankan Hemidactylus do not represent a single insular radiation. Rather, each of six Sri Lankan species reached the island independently from different continental sources. There have been extensive Quaternary land connections between India and Sri Lanka but sister-species pairs of Hemidactylus on the two land masses diverged from one another much earlier, probably in the mid-Miocene.'], ['Tropical forests store higher above ground biomass (AGB) and AGB carbon (AGBC) than any other forest ecosystems.

This includes the endemic genera Aspidura, Balanophis, Cercaspis, Haplocercus, and Pseudotyphlops, which are of uncertain phylogenetic affinity. We present phylogenetic evidence from nuclear and mitochondrial loci showing the relationships of 40 snake species from Sri Lanka (22 endemics) to the remaining global snake fauna. To determine the phylogenetic placement of these species, we create a molecular dataset containing 10 genes for all global snake genera, while also sampling all available species for genera with endemic species occurring in Sri Lanka. Our sampling comprises five mitochondrial genes (12S, 16S, cyt-b, ND2, and ND4) and five nuclear genes (BDNF, c-mos, NT3 RAG-1, and RAG-2), for a total of up to 9582\\xa0bp per taxon. We find that the five endemic genera represent portions of four independent colonizations of Sri Lanka, with Cercaspis nested within Colubrinae, Balanophis in Natricinae, Pseudotyphlops in Uropeltidae, and that Aspidura\\xa0+\\xa0Haplocercus represents a distinct, ancient lineage within Natricinae. We synonymize two endemic genera that render other genera paraphyletic (Haplocercus with Aspidura, and Cercaspis with Lycodon), and discover that further endemic radiations may be present on the island, including a new taxon from the blindsnake family Typhlopidae, suggesting a large endemic radiation.

Hydrological response of watersheds due to conversion of natural grasslands into bluegum (Eucalyptus globulus) plantations on low flows and high flows has been presented in this paper. The concept of using low flow index (LFI) as a tool to study and quantify the effects of bluegum plantation on low flow regime has been demonstrated. Conversion of natural grasslands into bluegum plantations has resulted in decreased low flow volume as well as peak flow, which in turn increased the soil moisture losses. These effects were more pronounced during the second rotation (i.e. first coppiced growth) as compared to the first rotation. Significant reduction in low flow as a result of decline in base flow could be predicted with LFI decreasing by 2.0 and 3.75 times, in the first and second rotation, respectively. Moderation in peak discharge rates was also observed as a result of bluegum plantation. Probability plots of peak discharge tend to suggest that the effect of bluegum plantation on peak flows become insignificant for the floods with higher return periods. These results clearly suggest that caution need to be exercised while planning large scale conversion of natural grasslands into bluegum plantations in the catchments of hydro-electric reservoirs in the Nilgiris which adversely affects water availability especially during lean flow period.'], ['Flood basalts are receiving increasing attention as possible host formations for geologic sequestration of anthropogenic CO2, with studies underway in the U.S., India, Iceland, and Canada. Our previous laboratory studies with Columbia River basalts showed relative quick precipitation of carbonate minerals compared to other siliclastic rocks when batch reacted with water and supercritical CO2. In this study, our prior work with Columbia River basalt was extended to tests with basalts from the eastern U.S., India, and Africa. The basalts are all similar in bulk chemistry and share common minerals such as plagioclase, augite, and a glassy mesostasis. Single pass flow through dissolution experiments under dilute solution and mildly acidic conditions indicate similar cation release behavior among the basalt samples tested. Despite similar bulk chemistry and apparent dissolution kinetics, long-term static experiments with CO2 saturated water show significant differences in rates of mineralization as well as precipitate chemistry and morphology. For example, basalt from the Newark Basin in the U.S. is by far the most reactive of any basalt tested to date. Carbonate reaction products for the Newark Basin basalt were globular in form and contained significantly more Fe than the secondary carbonates that precipitated on the other basalt samples. Calcite grains with classic “dogtooth spar” morphology and trace cation substitution (Mg and Mn) were observed in post-reacted samples associated with the Columbia River basalts. Other basalts produced solid precipitates with compositions that varied chemically throughout the entire testing period. Polished cross sections of the reacted grains show precipitate overgrowths with irregular regions outlined by dark and bright layers indicative of zonations of different compositions. Chemical differences in the precipitates indicate changes in fluid chemistry unique to the dissolution The Karoo basalt appeared the least reactive, with very limited behavior of each basalt sample reacted with CO2 saturated water. mineralization occurring during the testing period. Additional experiments conducted using mixtures of H2S and CO2 unexpectedly changed the relative reactivity of the basalts. For example, the Karoo basalt was highly reactive in the presence of aqueous dissolved H2S and CO2, evident by small nodules of carbonate coating the basalt grains after 181 days of testing. However the most reactive basalt in pure CO2, Newark Basin, formed limited amounts of carbonate in the presence of H2S. Basalt reactivity in pure CO2 appears to be controlled by the glassy mesostasis chemistry, which is the most reactive component of basalt. With the addition of H2S, the reactivity appears to be controlled by precipitation of insoluble iron sulfides as coatings on the basalt grains.'], [\"The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol allows Afforestation and Reforestation (A/R) projects as mitigation activities to offset the CO2 in the atmosphere whilst simultaneously seeking to ensure sustainable development for the host country. The Kyoto Protocol was ratified by the Government of India in August 2002 and one of India's objectives in acceding to the Protocol was to fulfil the prerequisites for implementation of projects under the CDM in accordance with national sustainable priorities. The objective of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of using large-scale forestry projects under the CDM in achieving its twin goals using Karnataka State as a case study. The Generalized Comprehensive Mitigation Assessment Process (GCOMAP) Model is used to observe the effect of varying carbon prices on the land available for A/R projects. The model is coupled with outputs from the Lund–Potsdam–Jena (LPJ) Dynamic Global Vegetation Model to incorporate the impacts of temperature rise due to climate change under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2, A1B and B1. With rising temperatures and CO2, vegetation productivity is increased under A2 and A1B scenarios and reduced under B1. Results indicate that higher carbon price paths produce higher gains in carbon credits and accelerate the rate at which available land hits maximum capacity thus acting as either an incentive or disincentive for landowners to commit their lands to forestry mitigation projects.\"], ['Grewia tiliaefolia is widely used in traditional Indian medicines to cure jaundice, biliousness, dysentery and the diseases of blood. Bioassay-guided fractionation of methanolic extract of the G. tiliaefolia bark has resulted in the isolation of D-erythro-2-hexenoic acid γ-lactone (EHGL) and gulonic acid γ-lactone (GAGL). Hepatoprotective activity of the methanolic extract and the isolated constituents were evaluated against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. The treatment with methanolic extract, EHGL and GAGL at oral doses of 100, 150 and 60\\xa0mg/kg respectively with concomitant CCl4 intraperitoneal injection (1\\xa0ml/kg) significantly reduced the elevated plasma levels of aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase and the incidence of liver necrosis compared with the CCl4-injected group without affecting the concentrations of serum bilirubin and hepatic markers. EHGL and GAGL significantly inhibited the elevated levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and glutathione in liver homogenates. Histology of the liver tissues of the extract and isolated constituents treated groups showed the presence of normal hepatic cords, absence of necrosis and fatty infiltration as similar to the normal control. The results revealed that the hepatoprotective activity of EHGL is significant as similar to the standard drug silymarin. To clarify the influence of the extract and isolated constituents on the protection of oxidative-hepatic damage, we examined in vitro antioxidant properties of the test compounds. The extract and the constituents showed significant free radical scavenging activity. These results suggest that the extract as well as the constituents could protect the hepatocytes from CCl4-induced liver damage perhaps, by their anti-oxidative effect on hepatocytes, hence eliminating the deleterious effects of toxic metabolites from CCl4.'], ['he environmental education needs of a currently wealthy developing country, Libya, are outlined.

The National Vector Borne Disease Control Program of India reported ∼1.6 million cases and ∼1100 malaria deaths in 2009. Some experts argue that this is a serious underestimation and that the actual number of malaria cases per year is likely between 9 and 50 times greater, with an approximate 13-fold underestimation of malaria-related mortality. The difficulty in making these estimations is further exacerbated by (i) highly variable malaria eco-epidemiological profiles, (ii) the transmission and overlap of multiple Plasmodium species and Anopheles vectors, (iii) increasing antimalarial drug resistance and insecticide resistance, and (iv) the impact of climate change on each of these variables. Simply stated, the burden of malaria in India is complex.

Since that time the two countries have made significant industrial progress and they have, relative to other Third World countries, a large number of well-educated people. However, the agricultural developments in India and China have been very different, though the two countries have a similar resources base. While the Chinese peasants, through hard work upon the rural land, have seen a substantial increase in their standard of living, the mass of Indian peasants are still living under severe circumstances and poverty. Furthermore, the rational management of land and water resources are much more advanced in China than in India. An important part of the difference in the agricultural and resources development of the two countries is related to the various guidelines of national economic performance and institutional settings. China has adopted a self-reliant basic-needs-oriented approach of national economic performance, which has given due attention to agricultural development and resources management. India has followed a Western-inspired liberal economic growth model of national economic performance, which has emphasised industrial development directed toward fastgrowing isolated economic enclaves within a basically subsistence economy. The cooperative ownership approach has improved resources management in China, whereas the small peasant/tenant approach in India has been unable to improve the resources management situation. The paper suggests that only a cooperative ownership approach towards land and water resources management will give any future prospect for an improvement in the standard of living for the mass of the people and the resources situation in India. Consequently, research activities in resources management ought to be directed towards cooperative solutions and experiences in India.'], ['IntroductionTriphala is a well-known Ayurvedic treatment for bowel problems.

Activity of MDA, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and nitrate–nitrite in colon tissues were estimated using plate-based assays. Gene-expression of CAT, SOD, glutathione peroxidise (GPx) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were estimated using Real-Time PCR. Lastly, HE staining was used for histopathological observations.ResultsNO scavenging revealed 80.00% inhibition at 500 and 1000\\xa0μg/ml, whereas complete inhibition of lipid peroxidation obtained at 500 and 1000\\xa0μg/ml concentrations. These activities correlated well with reduced oxidative damage (MDA 3.72\\xa0μM/g of tissue) after Triphala treatment with significant increase in CAT, SOD and nitrate–nitrite activity in colon. Gene-expression of CAT, SOD and GPx increased in dose-dependent manner, while eNOS expression increased at Triphala 500\\xa0mg/kg/b\\xa0wt, demonstrating strengthening effect on innate antioxidant defence. Histopathology of colon revealed muco-protection and restoration of normal tissue architecture. Administration of Triphala at 1000\\xa0mg/kg/b\\xa0wt significantly reduced colonic inflammation measured as reduced colon weight and crypt loss, reduction in infiltration by pro-inflammatory cells and focal necrotic areas in mucosa.ConclusionTriphala has promising potential for the treatment of IBD given its strong antioxidant effects in reducing inflammation.'], ['Environmental covariates are the basis of predictive soil mapping. Their selection determines the performance of soil mapping to a great extent, especially in cases where the number of soil samples is limited but soil spatial heterogeneity is high. In this study, we proposed an integrated method to select environmental covariates for predictive soil depth mapping. First, candidate variables that may influence the development of soil depth were selected based on pedogenetic knowledge. Second, three conventional methods (Pearson correlation analysis (PsCA), generalized additive models (GAMs), and Random Forest (RF)) were used to generate optimal combinations of environmental covariates. Finally, three optimal combinations were integrated to produce a final combination based on the importance and occurrence frequency of each environmental covariate. We tested this method for soil depth mapping in the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin in Northwest China. A total of 129 soil sampling sites were collected using a representative sampling strategy, and RF and support vector machine (SVM) models were used to map soil depth. The results showed that compared to the set of environmental covariates selected by the three conventional selection methods, the set of environmental covariates selected by the proposed method achieved higher mapping accuracy. The combination from the proposed method obtained a root mean square error (RMSE) of 11.88 cm, which was 2.25–7.64 cm lower than the other methods, and an R2 value of 0.76, which was 0.08–0.26 higher than the other methods. The results suggest that our method can be used as an alternative to the conventional methods for soil depth mapping and may also be effective for mapping other soil properties.'], [\"In the continuing race between man and nature, the ecological balance has been upset. It is becoming increasingly important for the Indian people to combat the danger inherent in the growing deterioration of the natural environment, the degradation of land, poisoning of the air, rivers and reservoirs and the pollution of cities. A third of India's potential agricultural land and three-fourths of the non-agricultural land is lying practically useless. Besides, three-fifths of our total agricultural land is degraded and, on the whole, three-quarters of all the land under cultivation and in forests needs urgent care. Such a state of affairs is partly due to the poverty and overpopulation in our country, and is partly because of complacency, ignorance and lack of policy and organisation at the highest levels. It is a sad but undeniable fact that our forest departments have, by and large, failed to protect our 70 odd million hectares of forest lands against encroachments, unauthorised felling and denudation. It is estimated that 6,000 million tonnes of top soil are displaced every monsoon season by water erosion. The environment has begun to show obvious signs of the misuse of our natural envirnoment. A classic example of this is the entire exercise in flood control in the Ganga basin. The silent valley controversy in Kerala focussed the nation's attention on the plight of the tropical evergreen forests. Silted-up reservoirs no longer have their original capacity.\"], ['It has been widely recognized that food security depends on the sustainable use and provisioning of ecosystem services. The goal of this paper is to present an overview of the scientific literature on ecosystem services and food security, with a major focus on case studies of farming communities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, in order to answer the following research questions: (1) does ecosystem services research generate knowledge that helps to address the major imperatives of food security?, and (2) are the multiple linkages between ecosystem services and food security analyzed or assumed in research? The results of the study highlighted that food utilization, access and stability, which are the major food security challenges in the world, remained under-investigated. There is a major bias on food availability in relation to crop production, and most articles assumed that food security would improve by increasing crop productivity, but this hypothesis remained largely untested. Other research blind-spots were co-production, trade-offs and off-site effects of ecosystem services in relation to food security, gender and cultural services. The study concludes that ecosystem services research needs to improve efforts to generate knowledge that helps to address the main imperatives of food security.'], ['Coastal zones are dynamic areas that are constantly undergoing change in response to a multitude of factors including sea level rise, wave and current patterns, hurricanes and human influences. On 26th December 2004, huge waves smashed across the shore between Kanyakumari and Ovari. As they crossed the beach, the waves up to 30 feet tall. Many people are dead due to crush and pull to sea and drowned as the mighty waves withdraw. Many villages have been obliterated, the death tale could exceed 300 but the damage to the property is very high. The size of the tsunami is related to the area that moves on the ocean bottom and how far it moves. This region is manifested with marine terrace, sand dunes, beach ridges, estuaries, floodplains, beaches, mangroves, peneplains, uplands, sea cliff, etc. We have attempted the shoreline dynamics using beach profile survey, and coastal environment changes through online survey, governmental, records and coastal geomorphological studies using remote sensing technique.

Although, in certain countries, the Tiger is given protection, in others it is still under heavy persecution. Surviving populations are now too scattered to maintain a viable genetic interchange. The chief cause of the decline has been the massive destruction of forests in Asia, but unrestricted hunting and poisoning and the demand for skins by the fur trade have also been important factors. Strenuous international efforts are now being made to create fourteen special reserves in order to save the Indian Tiger race, of which about 2,350 individuals remain.'], ['ObjectiveTo characterize abundance of leaf litter actinomycetes from Ternate Island and to assess the antifungal activity of actinomycetes isolates against Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), and Aspergillus niger.MethodsActinomycetes were isolated from leaf litter of Durio species, Syzygium aromaticum, Piper betle, Myristica fragrans, or Pandanus species and unknown plants. Actinomycetes isolates were cultured in a liquid medium. Bioactive compounds were extracted and tested against fungal using Beury-Kirby method with modification. Minimum inhibitor concentration and cell leakages were conducted. Actinomycetes that produced the highest antifungal activity were indentified using molecular sequence data in 16S rRNA gene.ResultsOut of 50 selected isolates, two isolates MG-500-1-4 and SR-2-2 has highest activity against S. cerevisiae. Concentration of material containing nucleic acids, proteins, Ca+ and K+ ions and morphological observations indicated that extracts of MG-500-1-4 and SR-2-2 caused cell leakage and invagination of S. cerevisiae cells. Based on 16S rRNA gene identification, MG-500-1-4 and SR-2-2 isolates are similar to Streptomyces misakiensis and Streptomyces tricolor respectively.ConclusionsTernate Island contains interesting biodiversity of actinomycetes that has potential use in agriculture, fisheries, and human health to reduce problem of fungal pathogen.'], ['ObjectiveTo explore the biotechnological potential of Ophiorrhiza mungos for micropropagation and camptothecin (CPT) production from in vitro grown plants.MethodsSurface sterilized explants of O. mungos were transferred aseptically in MS media containing various combinations of phytohormones for callus initiation and multiple shoot proliferation. The content of CPT was quantified in the methanolic extract of O. mungos plants and in in vitro grown plants by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).ResultsMaximum fresh weight and dry weight biomass of O. mungos callus was obtained from MS medium supplemented with IAA (2 ppm) + BAP (2 ppm) + GA (1 ppm). The maximum shoot proliferation (25) and elongation (6.5 cm) was found in MS medium supplemented with Picloram + Thidiazuron + Gibberellic Acid in 1:2:1 ratio after four weeks of incubation. The maximum content of CPT (0.0768 % w/w) was found in whole in vitro plants whereas the minimum CPT was observed in adventitious buds (0.0026 % w/w) as compared to the naturally grown O. mungos plants (0.0030% w/w).ConclusionsPresent findings indicate that O. mungos plants respond favourably for in vitro propagation and also produce higher amount of CPT as compared to naturally grown plants.'], ['The genus Hemitragus includes three species of tahr distributed in distant geographical areas: the Himalayan tahr, H. jemlahicus, occupies the southern flanks of the Himalaya Mountains; the Nilgiri tahr, H. hylocrius, is endemic to southern India; and the Arabian tahr, H. jayakari, is unique to the mountains of south-east Arabia. All previous investigations were based on morphology, and these three species together have never been included in a molecular phylogenetic study. In this study, we constructed a molecular phylogeny of the tribe Caprini sensu lato to determine the taxonomic status of the three species of tahr. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out on a matrix including most extant species currently described in the tribe Caprini sensu lato, and 3165 nucleotide characters, coming from four different markers, i.e., an intron of the nuclear gene coding for the protein kinase C iota, and three mitochondrial genes (subunit II of the cytochrome c oxidase, cytochrome b, and 12S rRNA). The results show that the genus Hemitragus is polyphyletic, as H. jemlahicus is associated with Capra (goats), H. hylocrius is the sister-group of Ovis (sheep), and H. jayakari is allied with Ammotragus lervia (aoudad). In the light of these unexpected results, we revaluate the validity of the morphological characters originally used for defining the genus Hemitragus. At least, we propose a new taxonomy, where the three species of tahr are ranged into three monospecific genera: the genus Hemitragus is restricted to the Himalayan tahr, and two new genera are created: Arabitragus for the Arabian tahr and Nilgiritragus for the Nilgiri tahr.'], ['Ethnopharmacological relevanceDysentery and diarrhoea are major causes of morbidity and mortality in rural communities of developing world. The Bhoxa community is an important primitive indigenous community of Uttarakhand, India. In this paper we have tried to scientifically enumerate ethnomedicinal plants and herbal preparations used by Bhoxa community to treat dysentery and diarrhoea, and discuss their antidiarrhoeal properties in the light of previous ethnomedicinal, pharmacological, microbiological and phytochemical studies. To record plants and herbal preparations used by Bhoxa community of district Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India in treatment of dysentery and diarrhoea, and to discuss antidiarrhoeal and antimicrobial properties of the recorded plants.Materials and methodsEthnomedicinal survey was conducted in different villages of Bhoxa community located in district Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India. Thirty Bhoxa traditional healers were interviewed to collect information on plants used by them for treating dysentery and diarrhoea. For each of the recorded plant species the use value (UV) and fidelity level (FL) was calculated. Detailed literature survey was conducted to summarize ethnomedicinal, pharmacological, microbiological and phytochemical information on the medicinal plants listed in the present study.ResultsFifty medicinal plants (45 genera and 30 families) were used by Bhoxa community to treat dysentery and diarrhoea, among which 27 species were used for dysentery, 41 for diarrhoea and 18 for both dysentery and diarrhoea. Three plants viz., Dioscorea bulbifera L., Euphorbia thymifolia L. and Prunus persica (L.) Stokes, recorded in the present survey have been reported for the first time in treatment of dysentery and diarrhoea by any indigenous communities in India. FL and UV values revealed that most preferred species for the treatment of dysentery and diarrhoea by Bhoxa community are Euphorbia hirta L. followed by Holarrhena pubescens Wall., Helicteres isora L. and Cassia fistula L. Earlier pharmacological studies confirmed that 27 of the recorded plants have some proven antidiarrhoeal properties and remaining 23 plants have to be pharmacologically evaluated for their antidiarrhoeal properties. Except 6 plants all the other recorded plants have shown antimicrobial properties in previous microbiological studies. Previous studies have corroborated the ethnomedicinal claims made by the traditional healers of the Bhoxa community.ConclusionsPresent study has provided new information on many medicinal plants and their uses. All the three newly reported plants for treatment of dysentery and diarrhoea have not been pharmacologically evaluated yet for their possible antidiarrhoeal properties. Twenty-three and six plants have not been evaluated pharmacologically and microbiologically, respectively. The present information may serve as a baseline data to initiate further research for discovery of new compounds and biological activities of these potential plants. Further research on these plants may provide some important clues for development of new drugs for dysentery and diarrhoea or other related diseases.'], ['Gridded rainfall data of 0.5×0.5° resolution (CRU TS 3.21) was analysed to study long term spatial and temporal trends on annual and seasonal scales in Wainganga river basin located in Central India during 1901–2012. After testing the presence of autocorrelation, Mann–Kendall (Modified Mann–Kendall) test was applied to non-auto correlated (auto correlated) series to detect the trends in rainfall data. Theil and Sen׳s slope estimator test was used for finding the magnitude of change over a time period. For detecting the most probable change year, Pettitt–Mann–Whitney test was applied. The Rainfall series was then divided into two partial duration series for finding changes in trends before and after the change year. Arc GIS was used to explore spatial patterns of the trends over the entire basin. Though most of the grid points shows a decreasing trend in annual rainfall, only seven grids has a significant decreasing trend during 1901–2012. On the basis of seasonal trend analysis, non-significant increasing trend is observed only in post monsoon season while seven grid points show significant decreasing trend in monsoon rainfall and non-significant in pre-monsoon and winter rainfall over the last 112 years. During the study period, overall a 8.45% decrease in annual rainfall is estimated. The most probable year of change was found to be 1948 in annual and monsoonal rainfall. There is an increasing rainfall trend in the basin during the period 1901–1948, which is reversed during the period 1949–2012 resulting in decreasing rainfall trend in the basin. Homogeneous trends in annual and seasonal rainfall over a grid points is exhibited in the basin by van Belle and Hughes׳ homogeneity trend test.'], ['Landscape ecology has brought spatial analysis and geospatial modeling to the forefront of ecological research. In this study, we investigated changes in landscape structure and the ecological consequences of urbanization in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area using spatial indices, change analysis, and geospatial modeling. Major land transformation patterns from 1975 to 2006 were mapped using multi-temporal classification maps. Landscape metrics for 1975, 1986, 1998, and 2006 were calculated and analyzed using Patch Analyst. The deforestation process due to urbanization in the future was modeled using GEOMOD within the framework of 2030 regional land use planning. Results reveal urban area expanded 82% from 1975 to 2006, mainly by displacing forest and agricultural lands by in-filling gaps within the urban area or near its periphery. Leap-frog development was noticeably absent. Many small patches of forest and agriculture located within or near the urban and suburban areas were replaced directly by urban land uses. Urbanization has become ecologically complicated but geometrically simpler whereas the rural landscape became less abundant and diverse. We predict: (1) forest cover will continue to decrease consistently due to on-going urbanization process; and (2) the pattern of deforestation will occur within the urban area due to in-filling and along its periphery as the urban area expands outward into undeveloped areas.'], ['End use efficiency experiments conducted in some households of Masur village (based on 4 days experiment) of Kumta taluk show that there is scope for saving 27–42% of energy by switching to improved devices, which are designed to maximise combustion rate (of fuel, ensuring the presence of sufficient oxygen), radiant heat transfer (from fire to vessels, keeping them as close to fire as possible), convection (to pass maximum hot gas over vessels, reducing drafts), conduction (heat is concentrated near the vessels by using insulating material for the stove) and user satisfaction (with user friendly design). The thermal performances of improved stoves designed at our Institute (ASTRA) have also been studied in the field. Irrespective of type of fuel, community, etc., improved stoves show significant saving in fuel. By switching to energy efficient devices 450,548 to 700,853 tonnes of fuel wood can be saved per year in the district.'], ['A generalised linear model was used to predict climatically suitable habitat for the golden bowerbird (Prionodura newtonia De Vis), an endemic species of the Wet Tropics of North Queensland. Mean temperature of the coldest quarter and mean precipitation of the wettest quarter were found to be the best habitat predictors. For independent validation data, accuracy was 67% (Kappa statistic, n=30). Past, and future habitats suitable to the golden bowerbird were mapped by altering the temperature and precipitation input to the model. In the current climate, total potential habitat is estimated to be 1564 km2, occurring as a number of separate patches with distinct bowerbird subpopulations. Past habitat was most limiting, 406 km2, during the Holocene climatic optimum (c. 5000–3600 YBP, +2\\xa0°C and +50% rainfall relative to today). With future warming, assuming a 10% decrease in rainfall, potential habitat is reduced to 582 km2 (1\\xa0°C warming), 163 km2 (2\\xa0°C warming) and 37 km2 (3\\xa0°C warming). Thus, global warming in the coming decades is likely to be a significant threat to the survival of this and similar upland and highland species in the tropics.'], ['The present study is proposed to determine the antioxidant activity of raw and processed samples of underutilized legumes, Entada scandens seed kernel and Canavalia gladiata seeds. The indigenous processing methods like dry heating, autoclaving and soaking followed by autoclaving in different solutions (plain water, ash, sugar and sodium bicarbonate) were adopted to seed samples. All other processing methods than dry heat showed significant reduction in phenolics (2.9–63%), tannins (26–100%) and flavonoids (14–67%). However, in processed samples of E. scandens, the hydroxyl radical scavenging activity and β-carotene bleaching inhibition activity were increased, whereas, 2,2-azinobis (3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS+), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), metal chelating and superoxide anion scavenging activity were similar to unprocessed ones. In contrary, except dry heating in C. gladiata, all other processing methods significantly (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) reduced the 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) (20–35%), ABTS+ (22–75%), FRAP (34–74%), metal chelating (30–41%), superoxide anion radical scavenging (8–80%), hydroxyl radical scavenging (20–40%) and β-carotene bleaching inhibition activity (15–69%). In addition, the sample extracts of raw and dry heated samples protected DNA damage at 10\\xa0μg. All processing methods in E. scandens and dry heating in C. gladiata would be a suitable method for adopting in domestic or industrial processing.'], ['As part of an energy-reduction study at remote sites, we explore a power system comprised of hybrid renewable energy technologies, specifically, photovoltaic cells, battery storage, and diesel generators. An optimization model determines the design and dispatch strategy of the power system to meet load off grid, such as at a military forward operating base. The model alternately uses two types of load data from government agencies, simulated and observed, to assess the effects of these inputs. Because the latter data set contains errors and is incomplete, we detail the process of cleaning and imputing it to provide a year’s worth in hourly increments for two forward operating bases in Afghanistan. We then construct an approximation of a realistic 600-soldier camp load from the full year of observed data. We compare the design and dispatch output from the optimization model using the simulated and constructed (observed) data sets and demonstrate that the results can differ. We investigate the characteristics of load that influence the optimization model’s behavior regarding the design and dispatch strategy and show that mean load has a more pronounced effect than its shape. In addition, the photovoltaic cells are often used to help the generators run more efficiently, especially under load variability.'], [\"ObjectiveTo determine the anti-bacterial efficacy of chloroform, ethanol, ethyl acetate and water extracts of inter-nodal and leaves derived calli extracts from Mentha arvensis (M. arvensis) against Salmonella typhi(S. typhi), Streptococcus pyogenes(S. pyogenes), Proteus vulgaris(P. vulgaris) and Bacillus subtilis(B. subtilis).MethodsThe inter-nodal and leaves segments of M. arvensis were cut into 0.5-0.7 cm in length and cultured on Murashige and Skoog solid medium supplemented with 3% sucrose, gelled with 0.7% agar and different concentration of 2, 4-Dichlorophenoxyacetie acid (2,4-D) either alone or in combinations. The preliminary phytochemical screening was performed by Brindha et al method. Antibacterial efficacy was performed by disc diffusion method and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C.ResultsMaximum percentage of callus formation (inter-nodal segments 84.3 ± 0.78; leaves segments 93.8 ± 1.27) was obtained on Murashige and Skoog's basal medium supplemented with 3% sucrose and 1.5 mg/L of 2, 4-D. The ethanol extracts of leaves derived calli showed the maximum bio-efficacy than other solvents. The leaves and stem derived calli extracts on Proteus sp. showed that the plants can be used in the treatment of urinary tract infection associated with Proteus sp. Through the bacterial efficacy studies, it is confirmed that the in vitro raised calli tissue was more effective compared to in vivo tissue.ConclusionsThe bio-efficacy study confirmed that the calli mediated tissues showed the maximum zone of inhibition.

Compared to the many previous studies of LCLUC, the present study is innovative in that it applied geospatial data, tools and techniques for transdisciplinary research. It contributes to a wider discourse on practical decision making for multi-level governance. Undertaken as part of the BioDIVA project, the research adopted a multi-tiered methodical approach across three key dimensions: socioecology as the sphere of interest, a transdisciplinary approach as the disciplinary framework, and geospatial analysis as the applied methodology. The area of interest was the agroecosystem of Wayanad district in Kerala, India (South Asia). The methodology was structured to enable analysis of multi-scalar and multi-temporal data, using Wayanad as a case study. Three levels of analysis included: District (Landsat TM-30m), Taluk or sub-district (ASTER-15m) and Village or Gram Panchayat (GeoEye-0.5m). Our hypothesis, that analyzing patterns of land use change is pertinent for up-to-date assessment of agroecosystem resources and their wise management is supported by the outcome of the multi-tiered geospatial analysis. In addition, two examples from the project that highlight the adoption of LCLUC by different disciplinary experts are presented. A sociologist assessed the land ownership boundary for a selected tribal community. A faunal ecologist used it to assess the effect of landscape structure on arthropods and plant groups in rice fields. Furthermore, the Google Earth interface was used to support the overall validation process. Our key conclusion was that a multi-level understanding of the causes, effects, processes and mechanisms that govern agroecosystem transformation requires close attention to spatial, temporal and seasonal dynamics, for which the incorporation of local knowledge and participation of local communities is crucial.'], ['Ethnopharmacological relevanceInspite of tremendous advances made in allopathic medical practices, herbs still play an important role in the management of various liver diseases. A large number of plants and formulations have been claimed to have hepatoprotective activity. Jaundice is a symptom, indicative of the malfunctioning of the liver. This paper provides ethnomedicinal information on the plants used to treat jaundice by three important indigenous communities, i.e., nomadic Gujjars, Tharu and Bhoxa of Sub-Himalayan region, Uttarakhand, India.Aims of the studyTo record herbal preparations used by the studied indigenous communities in treatment of jaundice and discuss hepatoprotective properties of the recorded plants.Research strategy and methodsThe traditional knowledge of the studied indigenous communities on herbal preparations used for treating jaundice was collected through structured questionnaire and personal interviews. The interviews were conducted with 91 traditional healers (29 Bhoxa, 35 Tharu and 27 nomadic Gujjars) in Sub-Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, India. More than 250 research papers reporting ethnomedicinal information on the hepatoprotective plants used by various communities from different parts of India were extensively reviewed.ResultsA total of 40 medicinal plants belonging to 31 families and 38 genera were recorded to be used by the studied communities in 45 formulations as a remedy of jaundice. Bhoxa, nomadic Gujjars and Tharu communities used 15, 23 and 9 plants, respectively. To our knowledge eight plants reported in the present survey viz., Amaranthus spinosus L., Cissampelos pareira L., Ehretia laevis Roxb., Holarrhena pubescens Wall., Ocimum americanum L., Physalis divaricata D. Don, Solanum incanum L. and Trichosanthes cucumerina L. have not been reported earlier as remedy of jaundice in India. Literature review revealed that a total of 214 (belonging to 181 genus and 78 families), 19 (belonging to 18 genus and 12 families) and 14 (belonging to 14 genus and 11 families) plant species are used as internal, external and magico-religious remedies for jaundice, respectively by various communities in different parts of India. Most widely used hepatoprotective plant species for treatment of jaundice in India is Boerhavia diffusa L. followed by Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.)

Forty-seven tree species including several evergreens, 13 scrub and 15 climber-creeper species were recorded in a 0·25 ha area in the riverine forest which is at an altitude of c. 180 m. Thirty-seven species of fishes, 12 species of amphibians and 25 species of reptiles including Dasia haliana, a new record for India, were also collected. Sixty-three species of birds including the blackcapped kingfisher Halcyon pileata, crested-hawk eagle Spizaetus cirrhatus cirrhatus, grey-headed fishing eagle Ichthyophaga ichtyaetus and brown fish owl Bubo zeylonensis occur here. The Nilgiri langur Presbytis johnii, a threatened species, is the most common primate of this gallery forest.The Tambiraparani riverine forest may be one of the few places in India where several evergreen species can still be seen at such a low altitude. A proposal to divert the river water to a nearby hydroelectric reservoir to be commissioned in 1988, and illegal wood cutting, are the major threats to this ecosystem. Three recommendations are suggested to protect this riverine forest for the future.'], [\"The daily activity pattern of wild Francois' langurs (Trachypithecus francoisi francisi) was observed in disturbed habitat at Mayanghe National Nature Reserve of Guizhou Province, China, between 1999 and 2000. The behaviors of wild adult Francois' langurs were recorded at a 5-min interval using an instantaneous sampling method. The results indicate that resting, foraging, traveling, huddling, playing and grooming activities account for 35.41%, 31.67%, 14.44%, 9.61%, 8.54% and 0.33%, respectively, in the daily time budget of these adult Francois' langurs during the study period. In comparison with the results in undisturbed habitat, the decreased food availability in disturbed habitat changes the foraging behavior of langurs, and also changes time budgets of other behaviors, such as the increase of the proportion of traveling and the decrease of the proportion of resting. At the same time, the higher frequency of human activity in the disturbed habitat influences the time budget of daily social behavior of the langurs including playing, huddling and grooming. The patterns of activity rhythms of wild adult Francois' langurs in the disturbed habitat show some seasonal differences which are also discussed.\"], ['The cyprinid tribe Labeonini (sensu Rainboth, 1991) is a large group of freshwater fishes containing around 40 genera and 400 species. They are characterized by an amazing diversity of modifications to their lips and associated structures. In this study, a total of 34 genera and 142 species of putative members of this tribe, which represent most of the generic diversity and more than one third of the species diversity of the group, were sampled and sequenced for four nuclear genes and five mitochondrial genes (totaling 9465\\xa0bp). Phylogenetic relationships and subdivision of this tribe were investigated and the placement and status of most genera are discussed. Partitioned maximum likelihood analyses were performed based on the nuclear dataset, mitochondrial dataset, combined dataset, and the dataset for each nuclear gene. Inclusion of the genera Paracrossochilus, Barbichthys, Thynnichthys, and Linichthys in the Labeonini was either confirmed or proposed for the first time. None of the genera Labeo, Garra, Bangana, Cirrhinus, and Crossocheilus are monophyletic. Taxonomic revisions of some genera were made: the generic names Gymnostomus Heckel, 1843, Ageneiogarra Garman, 1912 and Gonorhynchus McClelland, 1839 were revalidated; Akrokolioplax Zhang and Kottelat, 2006 becomes a junior synonym of Gonorhynchus; the species Osteochilus nashii was found to be a member of the barbin genus Osteochilichthys. Five historical hypotheses on the classification of the Labeonini were tested and rejected. We proposed to subdivide the tribe, which is strongly supported as monophyletic, into four subtribes: Labeoina, Garraina, Osteochilina, and Semilabeoina. The taxa included in each subtribe were listed and those taxa that need taxonomic revision were discussed.'], [\"This article investigates how varieties of knowledge about flooding contribute to a more effective flood management (FM) governance configuration in Chennai, India. Drawing on the assemblage perspective and using the configurations approach for socio-spatial analyses of the city, we trace the knowledge construction processes around two networked FM infrastructures, drawing out the different discourses, actor coalitions and processes of practice. We see how technical knowledge on storm water drains is embedded and transformed within the primary government network, and how complementary knowledges about the ery system are expressed through counter mappings by academic activists. Identifying potential intersections between these knowledge processes indicates a strong potential to link long-term water management strategies that would mutually contribute to addressing the city's issues of flood risks and drinking water scarcity. However, we find that the varieties of knowledge around Chennai's FM run in parallel networks with few intersections, presenting distinct institutional boundaries to cross-boundary knowledge sharing. Lastly, using integrated FM as a heuristic framework, we analyse the contributions of the different streams of knowledge and the remaining gaps in order to assess the potential of building up the interconnections in Chennai's FM configuration.\"], ['Murraya koenigii (L.) Spreng., commonly known as curry leaf plant, is found in the different hilly regions of India. In the present study, fifty-nine accessions representing eight wild populations of M. koenigii were analyzed using thirteen ISSR primers. A total of 152 bands were amplified, out of which, 136 were polymorphic corresponding to 89.47% polymorphism across the accessions. The pairwise population genetic distances were calculated for all the populations that varied from 0.05 to 0.13 between the populations of M. koenigii. AMOVA and Nei’s genetic diversity analysis revealed higher genetic variations within populations than among the populations. The clustering of populations in the dendrogram was not in congruence with geographical affiliations. The results indicate that the ISSR method is sufficiently informative and powerful to estimate the genetic diversity in M. koenigii populations. As M. koenigii is an important wild plant genetic resource, therefore, information on genetic variability might be a potential source as breeding material for development of commercially valuable traits in M. koenigii plants.'], ['Over the years, renewable energy based power generation has proven to be a cost-effective solution in stand-alone applications in the regions where grid extension is difficult. The present study focused on the development of models for optimal sizing of integrated renewable energy (IRE) system to satisfy the energy needs in different load sectors of four different zones considered in Chamarajanagar district of Karnataka state in India. The objective of the study is to minimize the total cost of generation and cost of energy using genetic algorithm (GA) based approach. Considering optimization power factor (OPF) and expected energy not supplied (EENS), optimum system feasibility has been investigated. Based on the study, it has been found that IRES is able to provide a feasible solution between 1.0 and 0.8 OPF values. However, power deficit occurs at OPF values less than 0.8 and the proposed model becomes infeasible under such conditions. Customer interruption cost (CIC) and deficit energy (DE) for all zones were also computed to quantify the reliability of the systems.'], ['This paper is a case study of the contemporary changes that affect the Sanjay Gandhi National Park and its surroundings in the city of Mumbai. It cross-examines the relationships between urban nature and urban space in the case of a city of the South. We argue that the issue of equitable access to urban nature is embedded in the larger question of the Right to the City. We show how processes of urban growth that lead to a shrinking of the forested area are associated with a differentiation of the Right to the City, rather than a general consolidation of claims on space. Defence of the park is mobilised to redefine urban citizenship and leads to a form of graduated citizenship. This differentiates those who see their claims on urban space consolidated; those whose urban citizenship is degraded, and those for whom urban citizenship is denied.'], ['Decalepis hamiltonii (swallow root) belongs to Asclepiadaceae and is an endangered shrub. It is generally considered as a tuberous root food mostly in the southern part of India, being a good source of bioactive compounds and flavour compounds with 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzaldehyde as the major constituent which resembles vanillin. We improved D. hamiltonii plant growth and yield of tubers with enhanced flavour compound, by using triacontanol (TRIA) soil drenching. Irrespective of the plant source, the interactive difference of the TRIA concentration and TRIA treatment interval showed the marked difference for yield and flavour content. The administration of triacontanol (0.228\\xa0μM) soil drenching twice by giving second treatment with a gap of 60 days after initial treatment, showed fast sign of growth and good yield of tubers with enhanced flavour content. The GC–MS profiles of flavour compound 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzaldehyde in tubers showed significant improvement over controls (1.5 times more), which could be useful for various commercial applications.'], ['Landslide inventories prepared manually from remote sensing data or through field surveys have shown to be useful for preparation of landslide susceptibility and hazard maps. Recent literatures show several studies have been carried out to prepare landslide inventories from satellite data by automatic methods. However, almost no attempt has been made to validate the effect of such inventories on landslide hazard and risk assessment. In this paper we have shown how landslide inventories prepared by semi-automatic methods from post-event satellite images can be used in the assessment of landslide susceptibility, hazard and risk in the High Himalayan terrain in India. A susceptibility map was made using the weights-of-evidence method, wherein weights were derived using the semi-automatically prepared historical landslide inventories combined with a series of pre-disposing factor maps. Seven evidence layers were used for the calculation of weights, selected in such a way that the majority could be derived from satellite data. Validation was done using the test data created through a temporal subsetting of the inventories. Temporal probability was calculated through Gumbel frequency distribution analysis using daily rainfall data of a 13\\xa0year period for which landslide inventories were prepared from satellite data. Spatial probability was determined by calculating landslide density for the inventories per susceptibility class that represent a given return period. Elements at risk, such as buildings and roads, were interpreted from a high resolution Cartosat-1 (2.5\\xa0m) image. Absolute vulnerability of the buildings and roads were multiplied with landslide spatial probability to derive the total loss for different return-period scenarios and shown in a risk curve. This study has shown that the inventories prepared semi-automatically can be used for landslide hazard and risk assessment in a data-poor environment.'], ['This paper examines innovation and knowledge generation processes and the supporting role of intellectual property rights (IPR) both for systematized investigative science and traditional community led activities. Options for protection of traditional knowledge and life materials and processes are suggested. It is suggested that the systematic and logical merging of ideas from conventions like TRIPs, convention of biodiversity (CBD), and union pour la protection des obtentitous vegetales (UPOV) can lead to the creation of harmonized provisions that could satisfy basic and minimum standards of IPR and societal ethics. The need for the unambiguous definition of discovery and invention in the granting of patents for biotechnological investigations is explored, as well as the issues of the establishment of prior art from unstructured traditional knowledge, identifying legal owners of traditional knowledge and evaluating prior art in this domain. The imperative task of creating a structured knowledge database of traditional practices and linking them through global networks is highlighted. The author also points to the fact that rigorous examination and search of patents in biotechnology is demanding ever greater levels of technical expertise and ultrahigh speed computing.Four case studies are presented to illustrate issues related to:•the erroneous granting of a patent and the role of documented community prior art in its revocation,•equitable sharing of benefits with indigenous tribes,•sharing of benefits with the community and•integrating indigenous knowledge, modern science and reciprocity into novel drug discovery.'], ['A comparison of the semi-arid cratonic regions of monsoon West Africa and South India reveals that while the former is typified by ‘ferruginous tropical soils’, the latter is extensively blanketed by soils exhibiting ‘fersiallitic’ properties, which are rare south of the Sahara. Such challenging differences can be understood taking into account the denudational history to explain the geography and properties of tropical soils.'], ['Ants are chemical factories, and among their more noticeable products are their venoms. Though many studies have addressed the properties and activities of ant venoms, basic venom-related physiological questions, such as how venom production and replacement may vary with age, are rarely addressed. The answers to these questions are fundamental to understanding the physiological capabilities of these organisms, as well as the parameters within which potential optimization of their investment in venom production must take place. The only previous investigation into venom production in ants found it to be limited to early life in workers of the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta (Haight and Tschinkel, 2003). Because similar studies have not been conducted for comparison, it is unclear whether or not this is a common physiological pattern in ants. As a parsimonious way to address this question, and, more generally, to increase the currently scant information available regarding the venom-producing capabilities of ants, the longevity, temporal polyethism, age-related venom production, and age-related venom replacement capabilities of workers of Jerdon’s jumping ant, Harpegnathos saltator were investigated. Longevity varied from 10\\xa0days to nearly 2\\xa0years, with a median lifespan of 206\\xa0days. Workers remained in the nest when young, transitioned to outside work (foraging) after 50\\xa0days of age, and reached a plateau in their tendency to be outside the nest at 74\\xa0days of age. They eclosed with empty venom sacs, filled them by about 57\\xa0days of age, and were able to replace venom at all three ages tested (though at a higher rate when aged 100\\xa0days than 30 and 206). So, venom-production ability is not limited to early life in H. saltator workers, and aspects of venom physiology and exploratory behavior appear to coincide in a manner likely to result in foraging efficiency benefits; venom sacs reach fullness around the age workers begin their foraging careers, and venom replacement rate is highest around the age workers become the most dedicated foragers.'], ['A study was undertaken to assess the contribution of bamboo to the vegetation structure, biomass productivity and nutrient cycling pattern in 15- and 20-year-old teak plantations in the Kariem-muriem Forest Range, Kerala, India. Based on the distribution pattern of bamboo colonised in these plantations, three types of site were recognised: site type A (bamboo-rich area), site type B (moderately bamboo-rich area) and site type C (bamboo-poor area). Density, basal area, number of culms per hectare, biomass, litter and net primary production of bamboo were greater in site type A than in site types B and C. While the soils of site types A and B were rich in potassium, those of site type C were rich in calcium. In addition to this, a negative correlation between above-ground biomass of bamboo and teak was recorded in site type A. In the case of teak, the rate of accumulation and the enrichment ratio of calcium were more than those of other elements. However, in bamboo, the enrichment ratio and accumulation rate of potassium were higher than in teak. The values for these parameters in bamboo were higher for potassium than for other elements. These results show that even from the nutrient conservation and cycling point of view, bamboo is a suitable species for site type A and teak is suitable for site types B and C. It is recommended that interplanting of bamboo in teak plantation, especially in areas like site types B and C, is not advisable. Instead, patch-planting may be more appropriate both to get better yield and to maintain ecosystem stability. It was also concluded that management of key elements of the ecosystem, such as potassium, is crucial for the stability of the ecosystem after disturbance or the conversion of natural forests into plantations.'], ['Bronger, A., Bruhn-Lobin, N. and Heinkele, Th., 1994.

In the present time, the economy of India is growing rapidly in a vibrant mode and an efficient way, which in turn demands huge uninterrupted energy supplies. The country's energy needs are met mostly by the usage of fossil fuels and nearly 70% of electricity is generated from coal based power plants. In India, nearly 840 million people depend on traditional biomass to satisfy their energy necessities. Approximately 74 million rural people do not have access to modern lighting systems and around 81 million households do not have access to electricity, which is a major challenge to India's energy security. In order to achieve stable sustainable energy in the long-run, significant progress in renewable energy sectors is needed. Favorably, due to India's geographic location, the country is blessed with abundant renewable energy resources, which has not yet been exploited completely. So the central and state governments of the country have framed various policies and are providing subsidies to encourage the utilization of solar photovoltaic systems. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the potential, current developmental status and prospects of solar energy of India is briefed. The various applications of solar energy such as water heaters, desalination units, pasteurizers, food drying units, water purifier, space heating systems, air-conditioning units, cookers, water pumps, aerators, solar-wind hybrid systems and grid connected photovoltaic systems are explained. The study also mentions the current renewable energy policies, the barriers blocking the progress of the solar manufacturing units and some possible future recommendations that might speed up renewable energy developments in India.\"], ['Bioenergy is the energy released from the reaction of organic carbon material with oxygen. The organic material derived from plants and animals is also referred to as biomass. Biomass is a flexible feedstock capable of conversion into solid, liquid and gaseous fuels by chemical and biological processes. These intermediate biofuels (such as methane gas, ethanol, charcoal) can be substituted for fossil based fuels. Wood and charcoal are important as household fuels and for small scale industries such as brick making, cashew processing etc. The scarcity of biofuels has far reaching implications on the environment. Hence, expansion of bioenergy systems could be influential in bettering both the socio-economic condition and the environment of the region. This paper examines the present role of biomass in the region’s (Uttara Kannada District, Karnataka State, India) energy supply and calculates the potential for future biomass provision and scope for conversion to both modern and traditional fuels. Based on the detailed investigation of biomass resource availability and demand, we can categorise the Uttara Kannada District into two zones (a) Biomass surplus zone consisting of Taluks mainly from hilly area (b) Biomass deficit zone, consisting of thickly populated coastal Taluks such as Bhatkal, Kumta, Ankola, Honnavar and Karwar. Fuel wood is mainly used for cooking and horticulture residues from coconut, arecanut trees are used for water heating purposes. Most of the households in this region still use traditional stoves where efficiency is less than 10%. The present inefficient fuel consumption could be brought down by the usage of fuel efficient stoves (a saving of the order of 27%). Availability of animal residues for biogas generation in Sirsi, Siddapur, Yellapur Taluks gives a viable alternative for cooking, lighting fuel and a useful fertiliser. However to support the present livestock population, fodder from agricultural residues is insufficient in these Taluks. There is a need to supplement the fodder availability with fodder crops as successfully tried in Banavasi village by some progressive farmers.'], [\"r SummaryThis chapter describes various aspects of the numerical weather prediction in low latitudes. The scope of real-data numerical weather prediction efforts with regional and global models over the tropics is addressed. The regional prediction covers models based on simple conservation laws and more general primitive-equation models with detailed physical parameterization. The global model is a multilevel, high-resolution spectral model with detailed physics and initialization. In the tropical modeling effort, initialization appears to be necessary as retaining gravitational divergent modes—such as the Hadley–Walker—and storm-scale divergent circulations is required. The version of multilevel grid-point and global spectral models presented in the chapter includes a fairly sophisticated radiative parameterization. The various elements of this parameterization include the emissivity method for calculating long-wave radiation, the absorptivity method for calculating short-wave radiation, and energy balance at the earth's surface.\"], ['The use of herbal drugs for the prevention and treatment of various health ailments has been in practice from time immemorial. Generally it is believed that the risk associated with herbal drugs is very less, but reports on serious reactions are indicating to the need for development of effective marker systems for isolation and identification of the individual components. Standards for herbal drugs are being developed worldwide but as yet there is no common consensus as to how these should be adopted. Standardization, stability and quality control for herbal drugs are feasible, but difficult to accomplish. Further, the regulation of these drugs is not uniform across countries. There are variations in the methods used across medicine systems and countries in achieving stability and quality control. The present study attempts to identify the evolution of technical standards in manufacturing and the regulatory guideline development for commercialization of herbal drugs.'], ['Coffee is the world’s most valuable tropical export crop. Recent studies predict severe climate change impacts on Coffea arabica (C. arabica) production. However, quantitative production figures are necessary to provide coffee stakeholders and policy makers with evidence to justify immediate action. Using data from the northern Tanzanian highlands, we demonstrate for the first time that increasing night time (Tmin) temperature is the most significant climatic variable responsible for diminishing C. arabica yields between 1961 and 2012. Projecting this forward, every 1\\xa0°C rise in Tmin will result in annual yield losses of 137\\xa0±\\xa016.87\\xa0kg\\xa0ha−1 (P\\xa0=\\xa01.80e-10). According to our ARIMA model, average coffee production will drop to 145\\xa0±\\xa041\\xa0kg\\xa0ha−1 (P\\xa0=\\xa08.45e-09) by 2060. Consequently, without adequate adaptation strategies and/or substantial external inputs, coffee production will be severely reduced in the Tanzanian highlands in the near future. Attention should also be drawn to the arabica growing regions of Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ethiopia and Kenya, as substantiated time series evidence shows these areas have followed strikingly similar minimum temperature trends. This is the first study on coffee, globally, providing essential time series evidence that climate change has already had a negative impact on C. arabica yields.'], ['The population structure of Cirrhinus mrigala from different riverine locations in India was investigated using allozyme and microsatellite loci. C. mrigala samples were obtained from ten rivers belonging to Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra and Mahanadi basins. Seven (29.2%) out of 24 allozyme loci and seven microsatellite loci were polymorphic, including five from our earlier work. Significant deviation (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) from the Hardy–Weinberg expectations were evident for two allozyme loci: G6PDH⁎, XDH⁎, and two microsatellite loci: MFW17, R-12F, in different samples. Both markers types demonstrated concordant results and various estimates revealed genetic variability within the subpopulations but surprisingly low level (θ\\xa0=\\xa00.015 to 0.02) of genetic differentiation among C. mrigala from different river samples. AMOVA analysis also indicated low differentiation among subpopulations. Common ancestry in the prehistoric period and possible exchange of individuals between rivers in different river basins such as Indus and Ganges could have been responsible for the observed low level of genetic differentiation among wild mrigal populations.'], [\"The amount of power available at a given site is decided by the volumetric flow of water and the hydraulic head or water pressure. In hydro schemes, the turbines that drive the electricity generators are directly powered either from a reservoir or the `run of the river'. The large schemes may include a water storage reservoir providing daily or seasonal storage to match the production with demand for electricity. These schemes have been producing power in Karnataka for many years, with the first hydroelectric station built in 1942. The majority of them are in Uttara Kannada district. Due to environmental constraints, further construction of storage reservoirs is limited and attention has been focussed towards developing environmental friendly small-scale hydro schemes to cater for the needs of the region. In this paper, the assessment of potential carried out in the streams of Bedthi and Aghnashini river basins in Uttara Kannada district of Western Ghats is discussed. Potentials at five feasible sites are assessed based on stream gauging carried out for a period of 18 months. Computations of discharge on empirical/rational method based on 90 years of precipitation data and the subsequent power and energy values computed are in conformity with the power calculations based on stream gauging. It is estimated that, if all streams are harnessed for energy, electricity generated would be in the order of 720 and 510 million units in Bedthi and Aghnashini basins, respectively. This exercise provides insight to meeting the regional energy requirement through integrated approaches, like harnessing hydro power in a decentralized way during the monsoon season, and meeting lean season requirements through small storage, solar or other thermal options. Net energy analyses incorporating biomass energy lost in submergence show that maximization in net energy at a site is possible, if the hydroelectric generation capacity is adjusted according to the seasonal variations in the river's water discharge.\"], ['Lymphatic filariasis is caused by three closely related nematode parasites: Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi and Brugia timori. These species have many ecological variants that differ in several aspects of their biology such as mosquito vector species, host range, periodicity, and morphology. Although the genome of B. malayi (the first genome sequenced from a parasitic nematode) has been available for more than five years, very little is known about genetic variability among the lymphatic dwelling filariae. The genetic diversity among these worms is not only interesting from a biological perspective, but it may have important practical implications for the Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis, as the parasites may respond differently to diagnostic tests and/or medical interventions. Therefore, better information on their genetic variability is urgently needed. With improved methods for nucleic acid extraction and recent advances in sequencing chemistry and instrumentation, this gap can be filled relatively inexpensively. Improved information on filarial genetic diversity may increase the chances of success for lymphatic filariasis elimination programs.'], ['The rising economic activities, growing population and improving living standards of world have led to a steady growth in its appetite for quality and quantity of energy services. As the economy expands the electricity demand is going to grow further, increasing the challenges of the more generation and stresses on the utility grids.

Further to these new technologies like smart grids, decentralized energy planning, energy management practices, energy efficiency are emerging. In this paper the attempt has been made to study and review the recent energy planning models, energy forecasting models, and renewable energy integration models. Also various modeling techniques and tools are reviewed and discussed.'], ['Pogostemon (Lamiaceae; Lamioideae) sensu lato is a large genus consisting of about 80 species with a disjunct African/Asian distribution. The infrageneric taxonomy of the genus has historically been troublesome due to morphological variability and putative convergent evolution within the genus. Notably, some species of Pogostemon are obligately aquatic, perhaps the only Lamiaceae taxa which exhibit this trait. Phylogenetic analyses using the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and five plastid regions (matK, rbcL, rps16, trnH-psbA, trnL-F), confirmed the monophyly of Pogostemon and its sister relationship with the genus Anisomeles. Pogostemon was resolved into two major clades, and none of the three morphologically defined subgenera of Pogostemon were supported as monophyletic. Inflorescence type (spikes with more than two lateral branches vs. a single terminal spike, or rarely with two lateral branches) is phylogenetically informative and consistent with the two main clades we recovered. Accordingly, a new infrageneric classification of Pogostemon consisting of two subgenera is proposed. Molecular dating and biogeographic diversification analyses suggest that Pogostemon split from its sister genus in southern and southeast Asia in the early Miocene. The early strengthening of the Asia monsoon system that was triggered by the uplifting of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau may have played an important role in the subsequent diversification of the genus. In addition, our results suggest that transoceanic long-distance dispersal of Pogostemon from Asia to Africa occurred at least twice, once in the late Miocene and again during the late-Miocene/early-Pliocene.'], ['A large-size solar cooker for animal feed has been designed, developed and tested. The cooker employs locally available materials of low cost, e.g. pearl-millet husk and horse excreata. The commercial materials required for its fabrication are plain glass, mild steel angle and sheet, wood and aluminium sheet cooking utensils. The solar cooker is capable of boiling 10 kg of animal feed, sufficient for five cattle per day. The efficiency of the solar cooker is 21·8%. The cost of the cooker is only Rs 1200, which can be recovered in 0·45-1·36 years depending upon the fuel it replaces. The short payback periods suggest that the use of the solar cooker is economic. The use of the cooker will save a lot of firewood, cowdung cake and agricultural waste which are presently used for the boiling of animal feed.'], ['We aimed to clarify phylogenetic relationships within the pantropical genus Diospyros (Ebenaceae sensu lato), and ascertain biogeographical patterns in the New Caledonian endemic species. We used DNA sequences from eight plastid regions (rbcL, atpB, matK, ndhF, trnK intron, trnL intron, trnL-trnF spacer, and trnS-trnG spacer) and included 149 accessions representing 119 Diospyros species in our analysis. Results from this study confirmed the monophyly of Diospyros with good support and provided a clearer picture of the relationships within the genus than in previous studies. Evidence from phylogenetic analyses suggests that Diospyros colonized New Caledonia multiple times. The four lineages of Diospyros in New Caledonia also differ in their degree of diversification. The molecular data indicate that one lineage is paleoendemic and derived from an ancient Australian species. The other three lineages are more closely related to several Southeast Asian species; two of them are neoendemics, and one has radiated rapidly and recently.'], ['Pharmaceutical and personal care products are used extensively worldwide and their residues are frequently reported in aquatic environments. In this study, antiepileptic, antimicrobial and preservative compounds were analyzed in surface water and sediment from the Kaveri, Vellar and Tamiraparani rivers, and in the Pichavaram mangrove in India by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The mean concentration of carbamazepine recorded in the Kaveri River water (28.3\\xa0ng/L) was higher than in the other rivers and the mangrove. Because carbamazepine is used only in human drugs, this may reflect the relative contributions of human excretions/sewage in these rivers. The mean triclosan level in the Tamiraparani River (944\\xa0ng/L) was an order of magnitude greater than in the other water systems, and the concentrations at two of the sites reported here (3800–5160\\xa0ng/L) are, to our best knowledge, among the highest detected in surface waters. Sediment levels were, however, comparable with other sites. We conclude that industrial releases are likely major contributors of triclosan into this river system. Among parabens, ethyl paraben was predominantly observed. Hazard Quotients suggest greater environmental risks for triclosan than for carbamazepine and parabens. This is the first study on antiepileptic, antimicrobial and preservatives in rivers and mangroves from India.'], ['Weathering profiles developed on basalt substrate contain information relevant to climate, atmospheric composition and evolution, nutrient release into the hydrosphere, and understanding Martian regolith. In this study, the chemical compositions of two profiles developed on Deccan Trap basalt are examined. One is sub-Recent and has only progressed to a moderate degree of alteration (Chhindwara profile), whereas the other is ancient (Paleocene) and the degree of alteration is extreme (Bidar laterite). In an attempt to better quantify the chemical changes during incipient to intermediate weathering of mafic substrates, a new index is proposed: the mafic index of alteration (MIA). Similar to the chemical index of alteration (CIA), the MIA quantifies the net loss of the mobile major elements (Ca, Mg, Na, K\\xa0±\\xa0Fe) relative to the immobile major elements (Al\\xa0±\\xa0Fe). The redox-dependent weathering behaviour of Fe is factored into two separate arrangements of the MIA that apply to oxidative [MIA(O)] or reduced [MIA(R)] weathering. The MIA can be visualised in a variety of ternary diagrams in the Al–Fe–Mg–Ca–Na–K system. To chemically quantify the stages of advanced to extreme weathering, at which the MIA and CIA are ineffective, the SiO2 to (Al2O3\\xa0+\\xa0Fe2O3) mass ratio, based on the established Si–Al–Fe (SAF) ‘laterite’ ternary diagram, is used; we propose that this ratio be referred to as the ‘index of lateritisation’ (IOL).Major element chemical variations, as expressed by weathering indices, are used to relate the extent of weathering with the behaviour of trace elements (alkali, alkaline earth, rare earth, and Nb) in the profiles. During the early stages of basalt weathering, the mobile trace elements (Sr, Be, Li) are anti-correlated with the chemical weathering indices and thus released during these stages. By contrast, the monovalent elements (K, Rb, Cs, Tl), excluding Na and Li, appear to be associated with the pedogenetic clay minerals. Of these elements, those with the most similar ionic radii are closely related in their weathering behaviour. Fractionation of the REE (Sm/Nd, Eu/Eu*, Ce/Ce*) is evident during weathering of the basalt. The loss of Eu is linked with that of Sr, Ca, and Na and thus associated with plagioclase dissolution during the stages of incipient to intermediate weathering. The fractionation of Sm/Nd suggests that basaltic weathering products may not always preserve their parent rock ratio and, consequently, their Nd isotope composition over time.Finally, weathering in the sub-Recent profile is shown to have progressed across two lava flows, whose morphology initially controlled the extent of weathering. Certain compositional variations in the original flows (e.g., immobile element ratios) are preserved through the effects of chemical weathering and have the potential to influence mass balance calculations across the entire profile.'], ['Soil erosion is not only a geomorphological, but also a land degradation process that may cause environmental damage affecting people’s lives. This process is caused both by overland and subsurface flow. Over the last decades, most studies on soil erosion by water have focused on surface processes, such as sheet (interrill), rill and gully erosion, although subsurface erosion by soil piping has been reported to be a significant and widespread process. This paper presents a state of art regarding research on soil piping and addresses the main research gaps. Recent studies indicate that this process (1) occurs in almost all climatic zones and in the majority of soil types, (2) impacts landscape evolution by changing slope hydrology, slope stability and slope-channel coupling, (3) is controlled by various factors including climate and weather, soil properties, topography, land use and land management. These issues are illustrated with various case studies from around the world. However, the majority of the reviewed studies used surface methods for soil pipe detection, although soil piping is a subsurface process. Surface methods, such as geomorphological mapping, may underestimate the piping-affected area by 50%. Moreover, most studies are limited to few case studies without presenting thresholds for soil pipe development in different environments. Subsurface erosion by soil piping is not represented in currently used soil erosion models. Therefore more research is needed to better understand the morphology and connectivity of soil pipes, their subsurface catchments, as well as soil erosion rates by piping in different environments. Knowledge of thresholds that induce erosion in pipes and subsequent initiation of gullies may help to improve models of hillslope hydrology and soil erosion that include pipeflow and piping erosion. The investigation of soil piping also requires improved methods that allow to better predict pipe development and collapses, and thus to detect piping-affected areas. Studies dealing with effective prevention and control measures of soil piping are scarce. Addressing these research gaps will help to improve our insights into subsurface erosion by soil piping, and thus help to better understand landscape evolution and hillslope hydrology, as well as to develop and improve effective piping erosion control techniques and strategies.'], ['This paper focuses on landscapes experienced by tourists on package tours to India. It examines how structure and content of 13 package tours create landscape experiences for the mass tourist which have little coincidence with the experiential reality of India. In this case, package tours encapsulate the visitor in vehicles and hotels in isolation from authentic environmental stimuli. Tours also direct tourists toward northern cities at the expense of southern and rural culture realms. Modern urban settings overshadow traditional ones and itineraries stress monuments to the past over current, every-day events and activities.

The plants T. asiatica and C. medica had higher water contents, which influenced the growth rate of the insect. M. koenigii was found to contain rich quantities of carbohydrate. M. koenigii, T. asiatica and C. medica were also rich in protein when compared to A. marmelos and G. pentaphylla. Total amino acid levels were comparatively higher in M. koenigii, T. asiatica, C. medica rather than A. marmelos and G. pentaphylla.'], ['Mineral extraction is growing worldwide, generating serious social and environmental impacts, and in the process, sparking significant resistance. The present article provides the first overview of non-fuel mining conflicts in India. The analysis is based on 100 cases of conflicts that occurred between 1992 and 2014, which constitutes the most exhaustive database compiled to date. In each case, location, mineral extracted, actors involved, cited causes of protest, conflict duration and outcomes were recorded. We found that the commodity responsible for the most conflicts is sand, the extraction of which is widespread and often carried out illegally by small-scale actors near rivers. Resistance against metallic ore mining, in contrast, typically pits local populations against larger corporations. Most resistance movements are composed of subaltern rural and/or indigenous populations; very few national and international NGOs were found to be involved in local movements. The causes of such conflicts have largely been ecological and responsible for an undermining of local livelihoods. Mineral extraction is expected to increase in India over the next decade, and with it, the number of associated conflicts.'], ['Water use by eucalypts has received a lot of attention in tropical countries during the past decade because of the large-scale introduction of these trees for afforestation. Eucalyptus grandis, widely used as a plantation item in tropical southern India, is the subject of a detailed ecophysiological study in this paper. A 4-year-old coppiced plantation was used for measurements. Microclimate data collected above the canopy were used along with stomatal conductance measurements to estimate the transpirational water loss by the Penman-Monteith equation assuming a two-layer canopy model. Leaf photosynthesis was measured diurnally and seasonally to understand the limitations in photosynthesis in the field. Results show that the water loss from the plantation ranges between 2.5 and 6.5 mm day−1 depending on the season. When suitably extrapolated, this amounts to 1181 mm annually in the study location, where annual rainfall averages 1302 mm. The stomatal conductance measurements showed that the increase in atmospheric vapour pressure deficit induced stomatal closure. This was probably regulated by the leaf water potentials also. Based on the above results it is concluded that E. grandis need not be a high water consumer because of its good stomatal control of transpirational water loss, especially during the dry season when the atmospheric vapour pressure deficit is high. The photosynthesis measurements led to a conclusion that the dry period experienced in the study location does not seriously affect the photosynthetic rate of the trees on a leaf unit area basis.'], ['Individual-based forest models simulate forest dynamics on the basis of establishment, growth and death of individual trees. This paper attempts to review and compare two major types of individual-based forest models: growth-yield and gap models. Although the two types of models share some similar features, they differ in model structure and data requirements and play several complementary roles. Growth-yield models are used by foresters to assist timber production and evaluate growth and yield of one to several commercial timber species in managed forests, while gap models are generally developed by ecologists to explore ecological mechanisms and patterns of structure and functional dynamics in natural forest ecosystems. Site-specific environmental and species information is necessary for constructing growth-yield models while gap models require species-specific biological information of individual trees and site-specific environmental data. The growth-yield models are more diverse in terms of model structure. In contrast, gap models belong to the same genealogy and later gap models are ultimately derived from the earliest one although they may vary in detail. In the future, we expect to see more individual-based hybrid models which integrate gap models with growth-yield models and ecophysiological models. As computer technology advances explosively, individual-based models could be much more efficient and user-friendly. There have existed disproportionately few individual-based models for biodiverse forests such as evergreen tropical rain forests. Development of individual-based models for tropical rain forests is more challenging and is being stimulated by new international conservation efforts.'], ['This case study has been carried out as a comparison between two different land-use strategies for climate change mitigation, with possible application within the Clean Development Mechanisms. The benefits of afforestation for carbon sequestration versus for bioenergy production are compared in the context of development planning to meet increasing domestic and agricultural demand for electricity in Hosahalli village, Karnataka, India. One option is to increase the local biomass based electricity generation, requiring an increased biomass plantation area. This option is compared with fossil based electricity generation where the area is instead used for producing wood for non-energy purposes while also sequestering carbon in the soil and standing biomass. The different options have been assessed using the PRO-COMAP model. The ranking of the different options varies depending on the system boundaries and time period. Results indicate that, in the short term (30 years) perspective, the mitigation potential of the long rotation plantation is largest, followed by the short rotation plantation delivering wood for energy. The bioenergy option is however preferred if a long-term view is taken. Short rotation forests delivering wood for short-lived non-energy products have the smallest mitigation potential, unless a large share of the wood products are used for energy purposes (replacing fossil fuels) after having served their initial purpose. If managed in a sustainable manner all of these strategies can contribute to the improvement of the social and environmental situation of the local community.'], ['This study analyzed the energy and economics associated with cultivation of traditional and introduced crops in the mountains of the Central Himalaya, India. The production cost in terms of energy for introduced crops such as tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) cultivation was 90,358–320,516\\xa0MJ\\xa0ha−1 as compared to between 19,814 and 42,380\\xa0MJ\\xa0ha−1 for traditional crops within Himalayan agroecosystems. For the introduced crops, high energy and monetary input was associated with human labor, forest resources, chemical fertilizer and pesticides. However, energy threshold/projection for farmyard manure in traditional crop cultivation was 80–90% of the total energy cost, thus traditional crop cultivation was more efficient in energy and economics. During the study, the farm productivity of introduced crops cultivation declined with increasing years of cultivation. Consequently, the energy output from the system has been declining at the rate of −y20,598 to y20,748\\xa0MJ\\xa0ha−1\\xa0yr−1 for tomato and y12,072 to y15,056\\xa0MJ\\xa0ha−1\\xa0yr−1 for bell pepper under irrigated and rain-fed land use in the mountains, respectively. The comparative analysis on this paradigm shift indicates that more research is needed to support sustainable crop cultivation in the fragile Himalayan environment.'], ['Satellite L-band synthetic aperture radar backscatter data from 1996 and 2007 (from JERS-1 and ALOS PALSAR respectively), were used with field data collected in 2007 and a back-calibration method to produce biomass maps of a 15\\xa0000\\xa0km2 forest–savanna ecotone region of central Cameroon. The relationship between the radar backscatter and aboveground biomass (AGB) was strong (r2\\xa0=\\xa00.86 for ALOS HV to biomass plots, r2\\xa0=\\xa00.95 relating ALOS-derived biomass for 40 suspected unchanged regions to JERS-1 HH).

Change detection showed a significant loss of AGB over high biomass forests, due to suspected deforestation and degradation, and significant biomass gains along the forest–savanna boundary, particularly in areas of low population density. Analysis of the errors involved showed that radar data can detect changes in broad AGB class in forest–savanna transition areas with an accuracy >\\xa095%. However, quantitative assessment of changes in AGB in Mg\\xa0ha−\\xa01 at a pixel level will require radar images from sensors with similar characteristics collecting data from the same season over multiple years.'], ['The habitat preferences of large and medium-sized mammals in the Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary were studied. Twenty-four species were recorded. Most prefer to live in specific forest types. In the case of primates, Macaca radiata was more abundant in forest plantations and in deciduous forests. Macaca silenus was cinfined to the evergreen forests alone. Presbytis entellus was more numerous in deciduous forests. Presbytis johni was more or less evenly distributed between the west coast tropical evergreen and moist deciduous forests. Herbivores and carnivores were most abundant in grasslands and in the Tectona grandis plantations.'], ['India has a diverse set of vegetation types ranging from tropical evergreen to dry deciduous. The phenology of these natural vegetation types is often controlled by climatic condition. Estimating phenological variables will help in understanding the response of tropical and subtropical vegetation to climate change. The study investigated the annual and inter-annual variation in vegetation phenology in India using satellite remote sensing. The study used time-series data of the only available satellite measured index of terrestrial chlorophyll content (MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index) from 2003 to 2007 at 4.6\\xa0km spatial resolution. A strong coincidence was observed with expected phenological pattern, in particular, in inter-annual and latitudinal variability of key phenological variables. For major natural vegetation type the onset of greenness had greater latitudinal variation compared to the end of senescence and there was a small or no leafless period. In the 2003–04 growing season a late start for the onset of greenness was detected at low-to-mid latitudes and it was attributed to the extreme cold weather during the early part of 2003. The length of growing season varied from east to west for the major cropping areas in the Indo-Gangetic plain, for both the first and second crops. For the first time, this study attempted to establish a broad regional phenological pattern for India using remotely sensed estimation of canopy chlorophyll content using five years of data. The overall patterns of phenological variables detected from this study broadly coincide with the pattern of natural vegetation phenology revealed in earlier community level studies. The results of this study suggest the need for an organised network combining ground and space observation which is at presently missing in India.'], ['Ethnopharmacological relevanceMajor research contributions in ethnopharmacology have generated vast amount of data associated with medicinal plants. Computerized databases facilitate data management and analysis making coherent information available to researchers, planners and other users. Web-based databases also facilitate knowledge transmission and feed the circle of information exchange between the ethnopharmacological studies and public audience. However, despite the development of many medicinal plant databases, a lack of uniformity is still discernible. Therefore, it calls for defining a common standard to achieve the common objectives of ethnopharmacology.Aim of the studyThe aim of the study is to review the diversity of approaches in storing ethnopharmacological information in databases and to provide some minimal standards for these databases.Materials and methodsSurvey for articles on medicinal plant databases was done on the Internet by using selective keywords. Grey literatures and printed materials were also searched for information. Listed resources were critically analyzed for their approaches in content type, focus area and software technology.ResultsNecessity for rapid incorporation of traditional knowledge by compiling primary data has been felt. While citation collection is common approach for information compilation, it could not fully assimilate local literatures which reflect traditional knowledge. Need for defining standards for systematic evaluation, checking quality and authenticity of the data is felt. Databases focussing on thematic areas, viz., traditional medicine system, regional aspect, disease and phytochemical information are analyzed. Issues pertaining to data standard, data linking and unique identification need to be addressed in addition to general issues like lack of update and sustainability. In the background of the present study, suggestions have been made on some minimum standards for development of medicinal plant database.ConclusionIn spite of variations in approaches, existence of many overlapping features indicates redundancy of resources and efforts. As the development of global data in a single database may not be possible in view of the culture-specific differences, efforts can be given to specific regional areas. Existing scenario calls for collaborative approach for defining a common standard in medicinal plant database for knowledge sharing and scientific advancement.'], ['We explore a model of utilization in a premarket economy of a biological resource population by a social group which is the sole owner of the resource. The group is assumed to be motivated to derive as large a harvest as possible while at the same time attempting to keep the risk of extinction of the resource population at a low level. It is shown that this can most likely be achieved through total protection of the resource population in parts of its range set aside as refugia. Many primitive societies indeed follow this strategy, which deserves to be given more serious attention as a tool for the management of renewable resources.'], ['Eight representatives spatially associated red and black soils in Purna valley from the semi-arid region of Central India were studied through mineralogical, micromorphological and geochemical investigations to infer pedogenic transformations during changing climatic phase. The morphology of soils showed that dissected alluvial plains over the basaltic landforms consists predominantly of dark reddish brown to dark yellowish brown soils with iron/calcium carbonate nodules (Typic Haplustepts), and lithological discontinuities (Typic Ustifluvents) whereas, pediplains and alluvial plains have clayey, dark brown, sodic, slickensided (Bss) horizons enriched with CaCO3 nodules (Typic Haplusterts). Buried Natrustalf on alluvial fans and floodplains has strong brown natric (Btn) horizons with distinct ferriargillans and abundant CaCO3 nodules. Ferriargillans in Alfisols indicates prevalence of humid climatic phase in the past during which alteration of plagioclase feldspars to smectites could have occurred, thereafter termination of humid phase and an onset of semi-arid climatic phase had favored drier non-leaching environment which has resulted in the preservation of smectites in Vertisols. The randomness in soils are expressed as entropy index which showed that physical mixing in subgroups of Vertisols and sodium enriched argrillic horizons in Alfisols were the indicators of altered pedogenesis at steady state. The formation of CaCO3 (pedogenic carbonates) and the concomitant development of sodicity during arid climatic phase were indicators of strong alkalinity and base accumulation in soils as a mark of aridity in red and black soils of the valley. The chemical index of alteration, weathering index, and entropy index were served as good indicators for assessing intensity of chemical weathering rate with respect to hydrology and topography. The study demonstrates that how the morphological, physical, chemical, mineralogical and micromorphological data were useful in assessing pedogenetic processes in spatially associated red and black soils of Purna valley.'], ['Orchids are among the most diverse of the flowering plant families, with over 800 described genera and 25,000 species. Orchids are prized for their beautiful long lasting flowers exhibiting an incredible range of diversity in size, shape and colour. Today growing orchids is more than just a hobby, it is an international business covering around 8% of the world floriculture trade and has the potential to alter the economic landscape of a country. Large-scale multiplication of exquisite and rare hybrids using tissue culture techniques has helped orchids occupy a position as one of the top ten cut flowers. As orchids are outbreeders, their propagation using seeds leads to the production of heterozygous plants. Hence, protocols providing regeneration from various vegetative parts of the plants are needed. Though orchid micropropagation has shown spectacular development in the recent years, the wide spread use of micropropagation is believed to be still limited due to problems like exudation of phenolics from explants, transplantation to field, somaclonal variation etc. We endeavour to include the major investigations on explant-based orchid tissue culture starting from the pioneering works of Rotor [Rotor, G., 1949. A method of vegetative propagation of Phalaenopsis species and hybrids. Am. Orchid Soc. Bull. 18, 738–739] followed by Morel [Morel, G., 1960. Producing virus-free cymbidiums. Am. Orchid Soc.

Therefore, this work aims to study spatio-temporal variation of the sediment discharge and erosion rate in the Mahanadi river, one of the biggest rivers in India, over past three decades vis-à-vis their controlling factors. To understand the sediment load variation, the trend analysis in the time series data of rainfall, water and sediment discharge of the Mahanadi river were also attempted. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall and Sen's methods were used to determine whether there was a positive or negative trend in the time series data with their statistical significance. The occurrence of abrupt changes was detected using Pettitt test. The trend test result represents that sediment load delivered from the Mahanadi river to the global ocean has decreased sharply at the rate of 0.515\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0tons/year between 1980 and 2010. Water discharge and rainfall in the basin showed no significant decreasing trend except at only one tributary. The decline in sediment discharge from the basin to the Bay of Bengal is mainly due to the increase in the number of dams, which has recorded the increase from 70 to 253 during the period of 1980 to 2010. Over the past 30\\xa0years the Mahanadi river has discharged about 49.0\\xa0±\\xa020.5\\xa0km3 of water and 17.4\\xa0±\\xa012.7\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0tons of sediment annually to the Bay of Bengal whereas the mean erosional rate is 265\\xa0±\\xa0125\\xa0tons/km2/year over the period of 30\\xa0years in the basin.

The “old” Kerala model, preoccupied with redistributive policies, failed, however, to induce economic development. As a result, attention is now being given to a “new” Kerala model. The new policy explicitly seeks reconciliation of social, productive and environmental objectives at the local level, and tries to develop synergies between civil society, local governmental bodies and the state government. The new Kerala model thus holds important lessons for participatory, community-based sustainable development in India and elsewhere.'], ['We contribute to the debate on the social implications of carbon forestry projects by showing that tradeoffs exist between social benefits of projects and their cost-effectiveness. Large-scale industrial plantations and strict forest protection are economically viable, but pose the highest social risks. Socially beneficial projects are less cost-effective because of their higher transaction costs. Enabling policies are also required for their success. Regulation of carbon markets will therefore be required to reduce social risks and enhance benefits. We propose a number of regulatory and proactive measures and justify them on the basis of market imperfections and concepts of sustainable development.'], ['IGROSS (interconnected groundwater systems simulation) is an industrial system of digital programs specially designed for multiaquifer groundwater systems simulation, and is based on the quasi-three-dimensional finite-element (FE) approach. Lateral aquifer connections and an accurate aquifer balance method are introduced in the FE scheme. The numerical solution of the system of equations is based on the substructured frontal method integrated in the steady case with a forcing iterative procedure and in the transient case with a predictor-corrector procedure. The system of computer programs is modular and the different programs are linked by means of auxiliary data files.The model of the Western Libya groundwater system is presented as a relevant application of IGROSS. This aquifer system extends over 800,000 km2 and is composed of four aquifers hydraulically interconnected both along aquifer branchings and through interbedded aquitards. The FE grid network contains 4407 aquifer elements ranging from 3 to 3000 km2, 3104 aquitard elements and 62 aquifer branching nodes.The steady-state model calibration was made with reference to the natural state of the groundwater system prior to its modern development (year 1960), adjusting the aquifer transmissivity and the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquitards. The calibration error has been less than 1 m. The volumetric balance of the groundwater system has been performed. Transient model calibration was made by simulating the history of exploitation in the period 1960–1979. During the transient calibration the storage parameters of the aquifers and aquitard were adjusted.The most suitable future exploitation of the groundwater system has been selected among ten different exploitation hypotheses simulated over the period 1979–2030. It is concluded that IGROSS represents a useful tool for the effective management of large interconnected groundwater systems.'], [\"When scientific forest management was introduced in India under British rule in the second half of the 19th century, it provoked great controversy. Intense discussion surrounded the effect fire had on sustainable forestry. Based upon a 2-year empirical survey in the Kadavakurichi Hillock area of the Dindigul District of Tamil Nadu, this paper revisits that earlier debate. The data show that despite shortcomings in tree growth, areas consisting predominantly of forests largely degraded by frequent fire can satisfy the needs of the local population. The various forms of land use practised in these areas are sustainable at low levels, particularly non-timber forest produce management. Statistical analysis and prognosis indicate that local forest use and management through frequent fire should be able to support this region's livelihood under the prevailing poor environmental conditions as well as into the future. The positive aspects of the traditional fire management regime are discussed against the prevailing paradigm of fire prevention.\"], [' for generating information on potential woody biomass productivities of tropical forest plantations is highlighted in this paper. Current rates of deforestation and reforestation, and features of plantation forestry in Brazil and India are presented. The plantation forest productivity in India is generally below 8 t/ha/yr while in Brazil it is higher than 10 t/ha/yr. A combination of factors, viz., quality of planting stock, nutrient supplements, and water application, are used to estimate potential and feasible productivities for semi-arid and sub-humid tropical regions. With no improvement in genetic stock and no supplements of water and nutrients, a productivity in the range of 2 to 5 t/ha/yr in semi-arid areas is estimated. With high-quality genetic planting material coupled with supplements of nutrients and water, a productivity in the range of 30 to 35 t/ha/yr could be expected in large-scale plantations.'], ['t is commonly accepted that forest plays role to modify the water cycle at the watershed scale. However, the impact of forest on aquifer recharge is still discussed: some studies indicate that infiltration is facilitated under forest while other studies suggest a decrease of recharge. This paper presents an estimate of recharge rates to groundwater in a humid forested watershed of India. Recharge estimates are based on the joint use of several methods: chloride mass balance, water table fluctuation, geophysics, groundwater chemistry and flow analysis. Two components of the recharge (direct and indirect) are estimated over 3 years of monitoring (2003–2006). The direct and localized recharges resulting from rainfall over the entire watershed surface area is estimated to 45\\xa0mm/yr while the indirect recharge occurring from the stream during flood events is estimated to 30\\xa0mm/yr for a 2\\xa0km-long stream. Calculated recharge rates, rainfall and runoff measurements are then combined in a water budget to estimate yearly evapotranspiration which ranges from 80% to 90% of the rainfall, i.e. 1050\\xa0mm/y as an average. This unexpected high value for a deciduous forest is nevertheless in agreement with the forest worldwide relationship between rainfall and evapotranspiration. The large evapotranspiration from the forest cover contributes to decrease the recharge rate which leads to a lowering of the water table. This is the reason why the stream is highly ephemeral.'], ['Worldwide, a disparity in utilization of wind resource is observed. Often, regions endowed with higher wind potential tend to receive fewer investments than those with lower potential. This study is aimed at identifying factors that result in such a skewed diffusion of wind power technology (WPT). These factors are identified by conducting a case study for a State in India - Maharashtra. The State is chosen as there is no correlation between wind potential in a district and corresponding WPT installed capacity. Only five districts (out of nine districts endowed with significant wind potential) comprising less than 50 per cent of the potential contribute more than 90 per cent of the capacity. Accordingly, this paper is an enquiry into role of local factors influencing the adoption of WPT. Five factors are identified through semi-structured interviews with six firms contributing to over 50 per cent of the installed capacity of WPT in Maharashtra. Subsequently, validation of the factors is carried out through econometric analysis using the data for nine districts of the state for the period 2006–2013. Results show that four factors – namely, geographical, technological, societal, and bureaucratic influence the decision of firms to invest in WPT.'], ['The bluegum (Eucalyptus globulus) has been widely grown in different parts of the world for multiple purposes. However, the possible adverse effect of converting natural forest watersheds into bluegum plantations on surface and sub-surface hydrology has been a major concern for researchers and planners. This paper critically evaluates the implications of coppiced bluegum plantations on hydrological behaviour during the 10 years of the second rotation using the paired watershed technique in a montane temperate humid climate. The coppiced bluegum growth (1982–91) on 59% of the catchment area reduced the mean annual total runoff by 25.4% and base flow by 27% over the natural grassland as compared with 16% and 15%, respectively, during the first rotation of 10 years. Regression relationships between observed and computed monthly values indicated a relatively higher reduction in the total as well as base flow during the first coppiced growth as compared with the first rotation. Reduction in runoff was at a maximum during July to October, which was ascribed to greater availability of rain water and hence its utilization during this period. The reduction during the dry period (January–April) is crucial for sustaining dry weather flow in the hydro-electric reservoirs. The increased utilization of water during the second rotation was as a result of the deep root system right from the earliest growth which produced 42% more biomass and 40% higher economic returns (at 1982–83 price level) than the first rotation. For the year following the harvest of bluegum trees of the first rotation, the hydrological behaviour was similar to the pre-treatment conditions. The maximum growth of the coppiced shoots height and diameter at breast height (DBH) was noticed during second to fifth year as compared with fourth year onward in the first rotation. Moisture extraction from deeper soil layers by coppice growth was significant (α=0.01) which was not true for the first rotation. Direct contact of tap roots with the ground water table was not observed during the second rotation even through an extensive network of lateral roots was present.'], [', popularly known as the “Queen of Spices,” has a checkered history, dating back to the Vedic period (ca. 3000 bc) and is among the ingredients poured into the sacrificial fire during the Hindu marriage. Today cardamom commands a leading position among the spices of immense commercial importance and is finding its way into the dietary habits of millions around the world, even among people on the European and North American continents, hitherto unaccustomed to its use. Cardamom use ranges from a simple dietary constituent to that of immense pharmacological benefits. Although beset with many problems, both agronomic and economic, it is a safe bet that next to black pepper, cardamom will emerge in the world market as a spice of immense commercial importance. Although India was the world leader in cardamom production, starting from the 1970s the country began to slide down both in production and productivity, while Guatemala, took the leading position, although the cardamom produced there is of inferior quality. Among the primary constraints of production, is the absence of an ideotype that combines many positive traits to boost production potential, while at the same time resisting the ravages of the devastating viral disease Katte of the Karnataka State in southern India.

The phylogeny suggests the existence of two well-circumscribed clades composed, respectively, of species with poricidal pollen locules (Boschia) and species with pollen locules that open with longitudinal slits (Durio s.str.). The latter clade is subdivided into two strongly supported clades: /Tubulidurio, with highly fused filaments and free calyx lobes, and /Palatadurio, with largely free filaments and connate calyx lobes. We provide phylogenetic definitions for the names of these well-supported clades. Reconstruction of floral evolution is consistent with the hypothesis that vertebrate pollination is ancestral for Durio s.lat. and Cullenia. However, there have been further shifts in pollination system within Durio s.lat., which may account for some of the current diversity of floral characters. The correlation of fruit and aril characteristics suggests that there are two major dispersal syndromes, involving either birds (fruits opening on trees; aril red/yellow and odorless) or terrestrial mammals (fruits opening only after falling to the ground; aril pale colored and pungent). The distribution of extant taxa implies a Malesian origin and radiation of the study group, with a single dispersal of Cullenia to India and Sri Lanka. However, the fossil pollen record raises the possibility that Durio and relatives may have migrated to Southeast Asia from the Indian subcontinent after it collided with Asia. A molecular clock analysis suggests that the earliest divergence within the study group occurred about 20 to 32 mya and, hence, does not favor either biogeographic scenario.'], ['Environmental heterogeneity is considered to be one of the main factors associated with biodiversity given that areas with highly heterogeneous environments can host more species due to their higher number of available niches. In this view, spatial variability extracted from remotely sensed images has been used as a proxy of species diversity, as these data provide an inexpensive means of deriving environmental information for large areas in a consistent and regular manner. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the state of the art in the use of spectral heterogeneity for estimating species diversity. We will examine a number of issues related to this theme, dealing with: i) the main sensors used for biodiversity monitoring, ii) scale matching problems between remotely sensed and field diversity data, iii) spectral heterogeneity measurement techniques, iv) types of species taxonomic diversity measures and how they influence the relationship between spectral and species diversity, v) spectral versus genetic diversity, and vi) modeling procedures for relating spectral and species diversity.

Samples were collected from 44 sites in monsoon season from rural, periurban, urban, industrial and commercial zones of the city. Along with the physico-chemical parameters they were also analysed for 10 heavy metals namely As, Mn, Ni, Se, Fe, Cu, Cd, Co, Cr and Pb in which except As, Mn, Ni and Se rest of the elements were below detection level. The concentrations (ppb) of highly toxic metals viz., As, Ni, Mn and Se ranged from 0.0 to 200, 0.0 to 80, 0.0 to 4200 and 30 to 140 respectively which are above the acceptable limits as per BIS/WHO standards for drinking purpose. ANOVA showed that pH, TDS, EC, Total alkalinity, Total hardness, Cl-, SO42-, F-, Na+ and Se showed significant variation at 0.05 significance level. Hydrochemistry was dominated by calcium, bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate in the study area. These facts are also supported by PCA and correlation. The order of relative abundance of the anions was Cl-> SO42->NO3->F->PO43- and for cations was Ca2+~Na+>Mg2+>K+. Zonal variation revealed that as compared to rural, peri-urban and urban zones, industrial and commercial zones had degraded water quality. As depicted from Water Quality Index (WQI) 80% of sampling locations have poor water quality, 7% very poor water quality, 4% unfit for drinking and only 9% out of the 44 sampling locations have good water quality.

However, guidelines for achieving the socio-economic and environmental objectives of the CDM, and other concerns with sinks projects, have yet to be elaborated. Independently of the Kyoto process, international efforts have advanced to define and certify sustainably managed forests through processes, such as that of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). In this paper, the FSC-US principles and criteria for sustainable forest management are evaluated in light of current concerns for guiding afforestation and reforestation projects in the CDM. It is found that the FSC criteria would help to meet some of the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol, including provisions to reduce the risk of premature carbon loss, and features that could somewhat lessen leakage of emissions outside the project area. Existing FSC monitoring and verification procedures provide some, but insufficient, overlap with expected requirements for measuring carbon stock changes. FSC principles and criteria articulate stringent guidelines for meeting environmental and social goals that reflect years of negotiations between environmental, timber, human rights and labor interests.'], ['Liana infestations can be a problem in forests managed for timber because lianas decrease rates of tree growth, damage tree boles, and inhibit tree regeneration. To determine the area from which lianas colonize tree crowns in a liana-rich moist lowland forest in a timber concession in the Department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, we described “liana sheds” of individual canopy trees (the area under the crown and beyond its margins from which lianas colonize trees). In the same area we tested the hypothesis that pre-logging cutting of lianas in a harvested tree’s liana shed reduces post-logging liana infestations. Prior to logging, 73% of 570 trees >10\\xa0cm in DBH representing 12 commercial species, carried at least one liana >2\\xa0cm DBH. Liana-infested trees hosted an average of 9.3 lianas (±0.45 S.E., range: 1–68). The mean area of the crown covered by lianas was 35% (±29.7 S.E.) but some trees (10%) were completely covered by lianas. “Liana shed areas” were a function of crown area and varied among tree species. Most lianas on trees were rooted below the crown of their host (90%); the number of lianas decreased with increasing distance from the crown edge, but lianas colonized trees from as far as 8\\xa0m beyond the crown. Overall, there was a significant reduction in the number of lianas in 22 felling gaps 8 months after logging where lianas were cut before logging compared with 22 control gaps. In control gaps, the majority of climbing lianas sprouted from the prostrate stems of fallen canopy lianas (81%), including 3.1\\xa0km/ha of stems that were rooted along the ground before logging. Liana regeneration in gaps after pre-logging liana cutting occurred mainly by stump sprouting (41%) and sprouting from prostrate stems (48%). Pre-felling liana cutting reduced liana cover in felling gaps by 9% only but reduced liana basal area by 69%. The results of this study suggest that tree crown area, shape, and height are among the most important factors determining the likelihood of liana colonization of canopy trees and that pre-logging liana cutting reduces post-logging liana proliferation in logging gaps.'], ['The production and marketing of non-timber goods (NTFP) and services gained importance in forest management as demand for these increased considerably. However, due to lack of relevant information on the level of output of non-timber products, its economic significance was seldom accounted for in the valuation of forests. Dry deciduous forests in India is one such typical case where forest valuation is yet to integrate the NTFP stock, widely used for subsistence and cash income. A detailed accounting of commercially valuable forest products harvested from dry deciduous forests of Eastern India was made to highlight the economic worth of forests and contribution of NTFPs. The net present value of revenues from NTFP was estimated to be US$ 1016 ha−1 in the coastal area and US$ 1348/ha in the inland area, which proved to be significantly higher than the returns from alternative land uses. Dry deciduous forests were estimated to have more value than had been assumed previously and compared favourably against potential timber revenue (US$ 268 ha−1). The result indicates the necessity of developing a new valuation protocol for use by forest managers while deciding conversion of forest lands for non-forestry purposes.'], ['he distribution and compositional changes of organic matter (OM) within the Godavari river system is increasingly influenced by reduced monsoon rainfall and an increased number of damming. To track these changes stable isotopes of organic carbon and concentrations of lignin phenols were analyzed in total suspended matter (TSM), sediments, agriculture soils and plants from Godavari basin. The results indicated that the upper tributaries drained heavier carbon (δ13Corg\\xa0=\\xa0−20.4\\xa0±\\xa02.2‰) than the lower tributaries (δ13Corg\\xa0=\\xa0−25.4\\xa0±\\xa01.5‰) owing to the regional vegetation in the upper to lower basins. OM originating from algae near dam impoundments was incorporated into TSM and sediment due to extreme drought condition. The organic carbon (OC) content was higher in TSM and in the sediment of the region after the middle reach dam (Sriram Sagar) than before (2.2\\xa0±\\xa01.6 vs. 1.0\\xa0±\\xa00.1% OC and 2.1\\xa0±\\xa02.3 vs. 0.6\\xa0±\\xa00.2% OC, respectively). The lignin yield (Λ8) was lower in TSM and in the sediment after the dam impoundment than before (0.37 vs. 1.94\\xa0mg/100\\xa0mg OC and 2.9\\xa0±\\xa01.1 vs. 5.4\\xa0±\\xa02.3\\xa0mg/100\\xa0mg OC, respectively) due to an increased contribution of lignin free OC from algae and degraded soil. Less rainfall and dam impoundments enhanced the fraction of labile OM from freshwater algae and an estuarine phytoplankton bloom in the study year. Our study is the first to document lignin fluxes from an Indian monsoonal river (Godavari). The flux of lignin phenols of 7.26\\xa0×\\xa0109\\xa0g\\xa0yr−1 is much lower than those of most world rivers except the rivers from polar arctic.'], ['To make mining activities more eco-friendly, it is important to conduct mining operations in a manner that is more environmentally friendly, economically feasible and socially acceptable. The volume of solid waste generated, including tailings from mineral processing activities, is one of the main pollution concerns in the mining industry. In the tiny state of Goa (India), it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space for dumping these huge volumes. And therefore ways of utilizing mine waste need to be found. This paper examines the suitability of these wastes for use in construction. Studies by others were reviewed where it was found that these wastes contain acid producing mineral phases and high concentrations of heavy metals. The presence of such concentrations can jeopardize the environment, if management of these wastes is not addressed with due consideration and care. Particle size classification on these wastes suggests that mine wastes contain coarse-grained rock, sand, silt and clays. A number of tests were then conducted on the aggregate part of mine wastes and the physico-mechanical properties were obtained. According to the results obtained the mean values of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of concrete cubes after 28 days of curing was found to be of the order of 21.93 and 19.91\\xa0MPa with mine aggregate and granite aggregate, respectively. Through toxicity leaching procedure tests the study also confirmed that the hydraulic binder arrests metal mobility from these wastes. This paper does not discuss the economic aspects as that was beyond the scope of the research. However, to some extent socio-economic perspective of mine waste utilization has been presented and discussed.'], [\"Land-use history interacts with natural forces to influence the severity of disturbance events and the rate and nature of recovery processes in tropical forests. Although we are far from an integrated view of forest recovery processes, some generalizations can be made. Recovery of forest structure and composition is relatively rapid following disturbances that primarily impact forest canopies, such as hurricanes. Recovery is considerably slower following disturbances that heavily impact soils as well as aboveground vegetation, such as bulldozing, heavy or long-term grazing, and severe fires, often with long-lasting effects on species composition. The landscape matrix plays a critical role in local recovery processes. Proximity of disturbed areas to remnant forest patches promotes more rapid recovery, which depends heavily on seed dispersal. Recovery of aboveground biomass is constrained by soil fertility and texture across regions as well as across soil types within a region. Restoration of soil fertility may be a prerequisite for forest recovery on sites with severely degraded soils. Despite evidence of rapid forest recovery following large-scale deforestation, many degraded areas of today's tropics will require human assistance to recover forest structure, species composition, and species interactions typical of mature tropical forests.\"], ['This paper discusses the potential for the development of tourism in the State of Tamil Nadu, India. It argues that the State is rich in both natural and cultural resources but is lacking in infrastructure and a well-defined development strategy. A resource based and an urban based development strategy are discussed and it is suggested that the latter may have advantages for a developing area in the early stages of tourism involvement.'], ['Airborne particulate chemistry mostly governed by associated sources and apportionment of specific sources is extremely essential to delineate explicit control strategies. The present submission initially deals with the publications (1980s–2010s) of Indian origin which report regional heterogeneities of particulate concentrations with reference to associated species. Such meta-analyses clearly indicate the presence of reservoir of both primary and secondary aerosols in different geographical regions. Further, identification of specific signatory molecules for individual source category was also evaluated in terms of their scientific merit and repeatability. Source signatures mostly resemble international profile while, in selected cases lack appropriateness. In India, source apportionment (SA) of airborne particulates was initiated way back in 1985 through factor analysis, however, principal component analysis (PCA) shares a major proportion of applications (34%) followed by enrichment factor (EF, 27%), chemical mass balance (CMB, 15%) and positive matrix factorization (PMF, 9%). Mainstream SA analyses identify earth crust and road dust resuspensions (traced by Al, Ca, Fe, Na and Mg) as a principal source (6–73%) followed by vehicular emissions (traced by Fe, Cu, Pb, Cr, Ni, Mn, Ba and Zn; 5–65%), industrial emissions (traced by Co, Cr, Zn, V, Ni, Mn, Cd; 0–60%), fuel combustion (traced by K, NH4+, SO4−, As, Te, S, Mn; 4–42%), marine aerosols (traced by Na, Mg, K; 0–15%) and biomass/refuse burning (traced by Cd, V, K, Cr, As, TC, Na, K, NH4+, NO3−, OC; 1–42%). In most of the cases, temporal variations of individual source contribution for a specific geographic region exhibit radical heterogeneity possibly due to unscientific orientation of individual tracers for specific source and well exaggerated by methodological weakness, inappropriate sample size, implications of secondary aerosols and inadequate emission inventories. Conclusively, a number of challenging issues and specific recommendations have been included which need to be considered for a scientific apportionment of particulate sources in different geographical regions of India.'], ['Ethnopharmacological relevanceJammu & Kashmir (J&K) is a predominantly Himalayan state in the north-western part of India. It has three geographically distinct divisions viz., Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh, which are immensely rich in their biological and cultural diversity. Medicinal plants are an important element of indigenous medical system of the region. The main goal of the present article is to examine the use of ethnomedicinal plants in three divisions of J&K and to discuss cross-cultural consensus on the use of medicinal plants in these divisions. The article also discusses the gaps in the current state of knowledge on ethnomedicinal plants of the region and gives recommendations for the future studies.Materials and MethodsScientific literature on ethnomedicinal field studies conducted in J&K state of India available in the journals, edited books and other scientific databases viz., CAB international, DOAJ, Google Scholar, PubMed, Science direct, SciFinder, Scopus and Web of Science were searched. Only field based ethnomedicinal surveys from last four decades up to December 2013 reporting first hand information on the medicinal plants used to treat human health related ailments by indigenous communities of J&K were included in this study. Venn diagram was used to analyze the cross-cultural consensus on the use of ethnomedicinal plants in the three divisions of J&K.ResultsA total of 948 plant taxa (923 angiosperms, 12 gymnosperms and 13 pteridophytes) belonging to 129 families, 509 genera, 937 species and 11 varieties have so far been reported to have a traditional medicinal use by indigenous communities of J&K. Asteraceae (60 genera, 132 spp.) was the most frequently used family followed by Fabaceae (32 genera, 50 spp.) and Lamiaceae (27 genera, 55 spp.). 514, 415 and 397 medicinal plants were used in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh divisions, respectively. Sixty eight plant taxa were used in all the three divisions, whereas 95 plants were common between Ladakh and Jammu, 127 plants between Ladakh and Kashmir, and 216 plants between Jammu and Kashmir. Maximum numbers of plant taxa were used for treating dermatological problems (321), followed by cold, cough and throat related ailments (250), fever (224), joint and muscle related ailments (215), gastrointestinal disorders (210), urogenital ailments (199), respiratory ailments (151), body pain (135) and gynecological disorders (127).ConclusionsThis is the first study from the J&K state, which has examined the medicinal plant use in three divisions of J&K and discussed the promising medicinal plant species with cross-cultural consensus. The analysis of the data suggested that while large numbers of plants are used medicinally in each division, there is a low interregional consensus and high variation between medicinal plants used in these divisions, which is due to both cultural divergence as well as biological distinctness. The issues related to current status of knowledge on medicinal plants used by indigenous communities of J&K have been discussed and some recommendations have been made for future studies on medicinal plants in J&K region.'], ['Vegetation structure and bird communities were characterized for three early secondary forest habitats near the town of Sinje, Liberia, West Africa. The habitats included a current farm (CF), a farm that had undergone two years of regrowth (RF), and a farm that had undergone seven years of regrowth (OF). Comparisons of vegetation structure among the three habitats indicated that as regrowth proceeds vegetation becomes taller and fills in open spaces but does not become more dense. Bird community comparisons showed that total species, unique species, mean density, and species diversity increase with increased time of regrowth. Proportions of resident, regular, and irregular species did not differ among the three habitats. Most species in all habitats foraged in medium-high vegetation, were foliage gleaners, and used insects as food.Bird communities were most similar between the CF and RF habitats, and least similar between the CF and OF habitats. The Sinje bird communities were compared with those of three habitats in the Mt Nimba region of Liberia. There was considerable similarity between resident bird communities of the OF habitat and a Mt Nimba second-growth habitat of similar age, and also between the RF habitat and a Mt Nimba grassland habitat.Ecologically, most of the species in the Sinje habitats were generalists with the proportion of secondary forest specialists increasing with increased time of regrowth. Very few species of primary forest specialists occurred in the Sinje early regrowth habitats.'], [\"We used the Ecopath with Ecosim software to develop a trophic mass-balance model of the eastern Great Australian Bight ecosystem, off southern Australia. Results provide an ecosystem perspective of Australia's largest fishery, the South Australian sardine fishery, by placing its establishment and growth in the context of other dynamic changes in the ecosystem, including: the development of other fisheries; changing abundances of apex predator populations and oceanographic change. We investigated the potential impacts of the sardine fishery on high tropic level predators, particularly land-breeding seals and seabirds which may be suitable ecological performance indicators of ecosystem health. Results indicate that despite the rapid growth of the sardine fishery since 1991, there has likely been a negligible fishery impact on other modelled groups, suggesting that current levels of fishing effort are not impacting negatively on the broader ecosystem structure and function in the eastern Great Australian Bight. Results highlight the importance of small pelagic fish to higher trophic levels, the trophic changes that have resulted from loss and recovery of apex predator populations, and the potential pivotal role of cephalopod biomass in regulating ‘bottom-up’ trophic processes. The ability to resolve and attribute potential impacts from multiple fisheries, other human impacts and ecological change in this poorly understood region is highlighted by the study, and will be critical to ensure future ecologically sustainable development within the region.\"], ['The aim of this study is to propose a method to assess the long-term chemical weathering mass balance for a regolith developed on a heterogeneous silicate substratum at the small experimental watershed scale by adopting a combined approach of geophysics, geochemistry and mineralogy. We initiated in 2003 a study of the steep climatic gradient and associated geomorphologic features of the edge of the rifted continental passive margin of the Karnataka Plateau, Peninsular India. In the transition sub-humid zone of this climatic gradient we have studied the pristine forested small watershed of Mule Hole (4.3\\xa0km2) mainly developed on gneissic substratum. Mineralogical, geochemical and geophysical investigations were carried out (i) in characteristic red soil profiles and (ii) in boreholes up to 60\\xa0m deep in order to take into account the effect of the weathering mantle roots. In addition, 12 Electrical Resistivity Tomography profiles (ERT), with an investigation depth of 30\\xa0m, were generated at the watershed scale to spatially characterize the information gathered in boreholes and soil profiles. The location of the ERT profiles is based on a previous electromagnetic survey, with an investigation depth of about 6\\xa0m. The soil cover thickness was inferred from the electromagnetic survey combined with a geological/pedological survey.Taking into account the parent rock heterogeneity, the degree of weathering of each of the regolith samples has been defined using both the mineralogical composition and the geochemical indices (Loss on Ignition, Weathering Index of Parker, Chemical Index of Alteration). Comparing these indices with electrical resistivity logs, it has been found that a value of 400\\xa0Ohm\\xa0m delineates clearly the parent rocks and the weathered materials. Then the 12 inverted ERT profiles were constrained with this value after verifying the uncertainty due to the inversion procedure. Synthetic models based on the field data were used for this purpose. The estimated average regolith thickness at the watershed scale is 17.2\\xa0m, including 15.2\\xa0m of saprolite and 2\\xa0m of soil cover.Finally, using these estimations of the thicknesses, the long-term mass balance is calculated for the average gneiss-derived saprolite and red soil. In the saprolite, the open-system mass-transport function τ indicates that all the major elements except Ca are depleted. The chlorite and biotite crystals, the chief sources for Mg (95%), Fe (84%), Mn (86%) and K (57%, biotite only), are the first to undergo weathering and the oligoclase crystals are relatively intact within the saprolite with a loss of only 18%. The Ca accumulation can be attributed to the precipitation of CaCO3 from the percolating solution due to the current and/or the paleoclimatic conditions. Overall, the most important losses occur for Si, Mg and Na with −286\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0mol/ha (62% of the total mass loss), −67\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0mol/ha (15% of the total mass loss) and −39\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0mol/ha (9% of the total mass loss), respectively. Al, Fe and K account for 7%, 4% and 3% of the total mass loss, respectively. In the red soil profiles, the open-system mass-transport functions point out that all major elements except Mn are depleted. Most of the oligoclase crystals have broken down with a loss of 90%. The most important losses occur for Si, Na and Mg with −55\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0mol/ha (47% of the total mass loss), −22\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0mol/ha (19% of the total mass loss) and −16\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0mol/ha (14% of the total mass loss), respectively. Ca, Al, K and Fe account for 8%, 6%, 4% and 2% of the total mass loss, respectively.Overall these findings confirm the immaturity of the saprolite at the watershed scale. The soil profiles are more evolved than saprolite but still contain primary minerals that can further undergo weathering and hence consume atmospheric CO2.'], ['Wiesneria triandra (Dalzell) Micheli is a phylogenetically isolated, local, endemic species of southwest India. It is annual and very sporadic in occurrence but when it is found it is often locally abundant. The inflorescences have mostly unisexual flowers with females borne below the males. Experiments have shown W. triandra to be amphimictic and self-compatible. Pollination can take place without a biotic vector. It is likely that it is highly inbreeding in spite of having unisexual flowers. The nutlets are very hard and have lateral gas-filled invaginations which provide short-lived buoyancy. The seeds have a dormancy induced by the testa (or perhaps the pericarp) which can be broken by mechanical, physical and chemical scarification. Dormancy is an important survival strategy, preventing seeds from germinating after showers during the dry season. The nutlets are dispersed over short distances by water. A mechanism for dispersal over long distances is unknown; the nutlets are digested by Anas platyrhynchos L. and are unlikely to be carried externally on water birds because they are hydrophobic, globose and rather heavy. Germination is typical for the family (with ‘Haarkranz’ and suppressed primary root) except that the hypocotyl emerges through a clearly demarcated cap. Plants growing in and out of water show a marked heteroblastic leaf development, the ‘juvenile’ leaves are strap-shaped while the ‘mature’ leaves are clearly differentiated into petiole and blade. In 1993 we were able to study two populations. Although the two populations were about 160 km apart, no convincing inter- or intra-population variation was detected using morphological characters and eight isozyme systems. Today, W. triandra is found only in habitats modified or maintained by man; the original habitat is discussed. Although rare it is not threatened with immediate extinction but is very susceptible to change in land usage and should be placed in the ‘vulnerable’ category.'], ['Detrital dynamics and microbial nutrient flux due to disturbances such as treefall and tree cutting were studied in a subtropical Pinus kesiya Royle Ex. Gordon forest in north-east India. Disturbance has substantially altered community structure, and therefore soil nutrient status. Natural gap formation has not resulted in significant changes in dry matter, C and N accumulation in litter and fine roots, or in microbial nutrient concentrations. However, there was a significant reduction in all functional parameters in the selectively logged site and soil heap. Soil microbial C, N and P were maximum in the understorey and minimun in the heap. Fine roots and microbial biomass contributed more to nutrient recycling in the ecosystem. N-mineralization was generally higher in the disturbed sites.'], ['The black inch worm, Hyposidra talaca (Walker) (Geometridae: Lepidoptera) has earned considerable importance as a defoliator during last decade in north east India. Characteristic features of H. talaca, such as switching from wild plants to Camellia sinensis, and completion of 6–8 generations in a year without winter diapause appear to be the major reasons for persistence of the defoliator on C. sinensis. There are reports on the aggressive infestation of the pest on C. sinensis than on alternate host plants and development of high tolerance/resistance to certain insecticides. Till date, more than one hundred alternate host plants have been recorded for H. talaca, but with very few natural enemies. To manage this pest chemically, synthetic pesticides are widely used. Integrated management is recently being encouraged wherein cultural, mechanical, physical, biological and chemical methods have been contemplated. This review collates the work and literature on the ecology of H. talaca and offers an analysis of the problems encountered in managing the defoliator in tea plantations. Further, future directions for better management of H. talaca are suggested.'], ['Management of natural forests might be one option to reduce the high deforestation rate in Ecuador. We therefore evaluated the response of water and nutrient cycles in a natural tropical montane forest to improvement fellings with the aim of favoring economically valuable target trees which will later be harvested with additional ecosystem impacts not considered here.The study was conducted at ca. 1900–2200\\xa0m above sea level in the south Ecuadorian Andes on the east-exposed slope of the east cordillera. In June 2004, one of two paired ca. 10-ha large catchments was thinned by felling 10.2% of the initial basal area (dbh\\xa0≥\\xa010\\xa0cm) on 30% of the catchment. The stems remained in situ. We measured ecosystem fluxes from rainfall via throughfall and stemflow to soil solution (litter leachate, soil solution at 15 and 30\\xa0cm depth) and stream flow between May 2004 and May 2005. After the fellings, soil solutions were extracted from the gaps created by the felled trees and the forest next to the gaps. We determined aboveground water fluxes by direct measurement and soil water fluxes with a budget approach. In the solutions, we measured concentrations of NH4+-N, NO3−-N, total dissolved N, PO43−-P, total dissolved P, Ca, Mg, K, Na, and Cl−. Fluxes were calculated as volume-weighted mean (vwm) concentrations times water fluxes. Dry deposition was estimated using Cl− as inert tracer.The fellings increased concentrations of N, K, Ca, and Mg in the organic layer of the resulting gaps compared with the forest next to the gaps (vwm concentrations of N: 6.4\\xa0mg\\xa0l−1 in the forest next to the gap/8.7\\xa0mg\\xa0l−1 in the gaps, K: 9.8/11, Mg: 1.8/3.0, Ca: 3.4/5.8). Lower nutrient concentrations and fluxes in the mineral soil of the gaps than in forest next to the gaps suggested that these nutrients were taken up by ground vegetation and target trees. The paired modified and undisturbed catchments had similar water and nutrient budgets. The fellings did not have a significant impact on the water and nutrient budget at the catchment scale.'], ['Since the early 1980s several new approaches towards forest management, which include active participation of local communities, have been tried out in many tropical regions. As a result of these efforts recognition has increased about the various ways in which many local communities are already actively managing their forest resources. The planning of development interventions to stimulate more efficient community involvement in forest management can often be based on such indigenous forest management systems. This paper aims to improve the understanding about the diversity and dynamics of indigenous forest management. The analysis consists of three parts. First an overview of the various types of indigenous forest management and their dynamics is presented. Subsequently, the basic principles of forest management are discussed. Forest management is characterized as involving a set of both technical activities and social arrangements for the protection and utilization of forest resources and the distribution of forest products. Three major categories of forest management practices are identified, e.g. controlled utilization of forest products, protection and maintenance of forest stands, and purposeful regeneration. The practices in the first category are both socially and biologically oriented, whereas the activities of the last two categories are biologically oriented. These principles are then used to develop a classification model of the various evolutionary phases in forest management. Along the lines of a similar model developed for exploitation of agricultural crops, various stages of forest management are distinguished along a gradient of increasing input of human energy per unit of exploited forest. This gradient represents a continuum of forest-people interactions; it illustrates how the various manifestations of indigenous forest management may be arranged along a nature-culture continuum.'], ['The genus Artocarpus (Moraceae) comprises about 50 species of evergreen and deciduous trees. Economically, the genus is of appreciable importance as a source of edible fruit, yield fairly good timber and is widely used in folk medicines. The aim of the present review is to present comprehensive information of the chemical constituents, biological and pharmacological research on Artocarpus which will be presented and critically evaluated. The close connection between traditional and modern sources for ethnopharmacological uses of Artocarpus species, especially for treatment against inflammation, malarial fever, diarrhoea, diabetes and tapeworm infection. Artocarpus species are rich in phenolic compounds including flavonoids, stilbenoids, arylbenzofurons and Jacalin, a lectin. The extracts and metabolites of Artocarpus particularly those from leaves, bark, stem and fruit possess several useful bioactive compounds and recently additional data are available on exploitation of these compounds in the various biological activities including antibacterial, antitubercular, antiviral, antifungal, antiplatelet, antiarthritic, tyrosinase inhibitory and cytotoxicity. Several pharmacological studies of the natural products from Artocarpus have conclusively established their mode of action in treatment of various diseases and other health benefits. Jacalin, a lectin present in seeds of this plant has a wide range of activities. Strong interdisciplinary programmes that incorporate conventional and new technologies will be critical for the future development of Artocarpus as a promising source of medicinal products. In the present review, attempts on the important findings have been made on identification; synthesis and bioactivity of metabolites present in Artocarpus which have been highlighted along with the current trends in research on Artocarpus.'], ['The study focuses on the assessment of inherent vulnerability of rural communities in Kimsar region to environmental hazards. A new conceptual framework was developed and hazard generic socio-economic indicators were identified in the assessment of inherent vulnerability of the communities to future harm. All the households from the selected villages were surveyed to collect information on the identified indicators. These indicators captured eight sub-components of inherent vulnerability, which includes lack of access to water, shelter, information, and connectivity, economic capacity, dependence on environmental resources, marginalised communities and gender. An Inherent Vulnerability Score (IVS) was computed, for each of the twelve villages by aggregating the data into a composite score. Sensitivity analysis was conducted for the composite score. The results obtained from a cluster analysis on the same village-level data were consistent with the IVS. Based on the results of cluster analysis, the villages were classified into three vulnerability groups ─ high, moderate and low. Access to water, dependence on environmental resources and shelter were found to be the most important determinants of inherent vulnerability in the region. Knowledge of inherent vulnerability will aid decision-makers to formulate policies, which will reduce vulnerability and help in rational distribution of resources among various communities.'], ['The altitudes of the ecotones between the main vegetation-zones up mountains of the humid tropics are reviewed, with emphasis on floristics and those areas with which the author is personally familiar. A detailed comparison is made of the zonation on Mt Kinabalu (c. 6°N) and the Himalaya of Bhutan (c. 27°N), and is supported by information from other parts of SE Asia, and to a decreasing extent South America and Africa. The relationship between forest-types based on structure and physiognomy and forest-types based on floristics is complicated. In SE Asia lower montane forests may be dominated by dipterocarps or an ‘oak-laurel’ assemblage. The dominant leaf size in both is notophyll, but the oak-laurel assemblage shifts to the microphyll size-class in China where the transition from tropical lower montane to warm temperate lowland forest begins. The opposite trend is seen where the lower montane flora of Papua New Guinea corresponds to the lowland flora in NE Australia. There are only modest changes between the Equator and the Tropic in the altitudes at which major transitions occur. It is concluded that soil changes, mediated only in part by temperature and associated climatic factors, may play a more direct and diverse role than has previously been indicated. The soil factors emphasized are the increase in organic matter content in lower montane soils as opposed to lowland, accompanied by a change from termite-dominance to earthworm-dominance, and the frequent occurrence of a dense moss layer and mor humus in upper montane soils. The case is made particularly by reference to east Asian mountains, which have been the most studied.'], ['There are several contentious issues related to forestry mitigation projects.

The first molecular phylogeny for continental African microhylids is presented, including representatives of all subfamilies, six of the eight genera, and the enigmatic hemisotid Hemisus. Mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA sequence data were analysed using parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian methods. Analyses of the data are consistent with the monophyly of all sampled subfamilies and genera. Hemisus does not nest within either brevicipitines or non-brevicipitines. It is possibly the sister group to brevicipitines, in which case brevicipitines might not be microhylids. Phrynomantis and Hoplophryne potentially group with non-African, non-brevicipitine microhylids, in agreement with recent morphological and molecular data. Within brevicipitines, Breviceps is recovered as the sister group to a clade of Callulina+Spelaeophryne+Probreviceps. The relationships among the genera within this latter clade are unclear, being sensitive to the method of analysis. Optimal trees suggest the Probreviceps macrodactylus subspecies complex might be paraphyletic with respect to P. uluguruensis, corroborating preliminary morphological studies indicating that P. m. rungwensis may be a distinct species. P. m. loveridgei may be paraphyletic with respect to P. m. macrodactylus, though this is not strongly supported. Some biogeographic hypotheses are examined in light of these findings.'], ['Concentrations of major ions, Sr and 87Sr/86Sr have been measured in the Gomti, the Son and the Yamuna, tributaries of the Ganga draining its peninsular and plain sub-basins to determine their contribution to the water chemistry of the Ganga and silicate and carbonate erosion of the Ganga basin.

Independent estimation of SER based on dissolved Si as a proxy give an average value of ∼5\\xa0tons\\xa0km−2\\xa0yr−1 for the peninsular and the plain drainages, several times lower than that derived using Na∗. The major source of uncertainty in this estimate is the potential removal of Si from rivers by biological and chemical processes. The Si based SER and CER (carbonate erosion rate) are also much lower than that in the Himalayan sub-basin of the Ganga. The lower relief, runoff and physical erosion in the peninsular and the plain basins relative to the Himalayan sub-basin and calcite precipitation in them all could be contributing to their lower erosion rates.Budget calculations show that the Yamuna, the Son and Gomti together account for ∼75% Na, 41% Mg and ∼53% Sr and 87Sr of their supply to the Ganga from its major tributaries, with the Yamuna dominating the contribution. The results highlight the important role of the plain and peninsular sub-basins in determining the solute and Sr isotope budgets of the Ganga. The study also shows that the anthropogenic contribution accounts for ⩽10% of the major ion fluxes of the Ganga at Rajmahal during high river stages (October). The impact of both saline/alkaline soils and anthropogenic sources on the major ion abundances of the Ganga is minimum during its peak flow and therefore the SER and CO2 consumption rates of the river is best determined during this period.'], ['The complex and dynamic nature of the coastal and marine area is prompting many nations to consider the internalisation of integrated coastal management (ICM) policy as part of a deliberate strategy for sustainable development. The institutional structures required to deliver such internalisation are subject to debate. This paper presents a suggested generic institutional framework derived through consideration of the core ICM process and proven organisational models. The proposed framework consists of an ‘operating core’ which facilitates local issue identification, evaluation and monitoring; an ‘administrative component’ of Central and State government to set policy direction, manage funding, and provide guidance on implementation and operation; a ‘strategic apex’ within Central government to oversee the transition from ICM concept to practice; and a ‘co-ordinating mechanism’ to allow open communication of ideas and information. The proposed framework is then applied to India, which currently faces the challenge of developing a suitable institutional framework to deliver ICM aspirations. It is concluded that the generic institutional framework works well when applied to India, with existing organisations and agencies requiring relatively minor organisational changes to address coastal and marine issues more effectively.'], ['Until now, phylogenetic studies of the mongooses (Carnivora, Herpestidae) have not included an exhaustive sampling of the Asian members of this family. In this study, we used mitochondrial (Cytochrome b and ND2), nuclear (β-fibrinogen intron 7 and Transthyretin intron 1) sequences from almost all of the recognized mongoose species to produce a well-resolved phylogeny of the Herpestidae. We also performed molecular dating analyses to infer divergence dates of the different lineages within the Herpestidae. Our results confirmed the paraphyly of the Herpestes genus and other phylogenetic relationships, which previously had only been moderately supported. The Asian herpestid species were found to form a monophyletic group within the Herpestidae. Within the Asian species, a cyto-nuclear conflict was discovered between the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus), the Indian gray mongoose (Herpestes edwardsii) and the Javan mongoose (Herpestes javanicus), which may have occurred through interspecific hybridization. This study inferred an Early Miocene origin for the Herpestidae and a Middle Miocene origin for the Asian mongooses.'], ['Earthworm biodiversity is modified when forests and natural savannas are replaced by agroecosystems; these changes can be studied from the taxonomic and functional point of view. In the first case the number and origin (native or exotic) of species is important, as well as the geographic scale of the study (local or regional). The functional approach considers the ecological groups (epigeic, endogeic, anecic), which have different effects on soil function. Studies in Mexico, Peru and India reveal that agroecosystem earthworm communities (as compared with those in the undisturbed ecosystem) have lower species richness, lower number of native species, lower number of ecological groups and a predominance of endogeics. Therefore the role of endogeic species in intensifying agroecosystems is likely to be more important for soil function, especially because they act as ecosystem engineers and through their mutualistic interactions with microflora, selective ingestion of soil particles, high rates of ingestion and production of casts, galleries, burrows and chambers can affect nutrient and organic matter dynamics and other pedological processes. Epigeic and anecic species do not appear to be as widespread in agricultural systems and their dependence on a litter layer for survival implies that litter management practices must be implemented for their role in soil function to be of importance.The role of earthworms in enhancing primary production depends on the synlocalization (in the same place) and the synchronization (at the same time) of their activities with the period and the sphere of active root growth and nutrient demands. Several field studies have found significant yield increases with earthworm inoculation, though more research is needed. Incorporation of information on earthworm life histories, field population variations, ecological strategies and short and long term effects on soil properties, in addition to plant and environmental factors (climate, soil, cropping period and management of the agroecosystem), are essential to properly assess the potential role of a particular earthworm species on plant production.Future research must focus on describing the role of native species and their interaction with or replacement by exotic species (belonging to the same or to a different ecological group) in soil function and agroecosystem productivity.'], [\"In the present paper the author aims to define the main goals of a modern forest policy for environment. The attributes of the forest ecosystem, particularly its productivity, stability, complexity, nutrient cycling and ability to protect the environment are described. The influence of forests on environmental quality is discussed at global and local levels, together with the role of forests as a habitat for wildlife. Forests have an impact on the most Important properties of the earth's surface which influence climate and which are likely to be affected by human activities. Such properties are earth reflectivity, heat absorption capacity and conductivity, regulation of water and dust control, emissivlty of the infrared band and amount of heat released to the ground. Specific references are made to physio-chemical, mechanical and psychological Influences of the forest at the local level. The author concludes by emphasizing some international aspects of pollution and the role of international cooperation In this respect.\"], ['Dendrocalamus strictus and Bambusa arundinacea are monocarpic, gregariously flowering species of bamboo, common in the deciduous forests of the State of Karnataka in India. Their populations have significantly declined, especially since the last flowering. This decline parellels increasing incidence of grazing, fire and extraction in recent decades. Results of an experiment in which the intensities of grazing and fire were varied, indicate that while grazing significantly depresses the survival of seedlings and the recruitment of new culms of bamboo clumps, fire appeared to enhance seedling survival, presumably by reducing competition of less fire-resistant species. New shoots of bamboo are destroyed by insects and a variety of herbivorous mammals. In areas of intense herbivore pressure, a bamboo clump initiates the production of a much larger number of new culms, but results in many fewer and shorter intact culms. Extraction renders the new shoots more susceptible to herbivore pressure by removal of the protective covering of branches at the base of a bamboo clump. Hence, regular and extensive extraction by the paper mills in conjunction with intense grazing pressure strongly depresses the addition of new culms to bamboo clumps. Regulation of grazing in the forest by domestic livestock along with maintenance of the cover at the base of the clumps by extracting the culms at a higher level should reduce the rate of decline of the bamboo stocks.'], ['his study in the Hariyali sacred landscape (Garhwal Himalaya, India) was undertaken to evaluate the impact of ecosystem type, quality of organic inputs and water management on diversity and abundance of earthworms. A total of seven species viz., moniligastrid Drawida nepalensis (Michaelsen), lumbricid Allolobophora parva (Eisen), megascolecid Eutyphoeus sp. (near Eutyphoeus pharpingianus), octochaetid Octochaetona beatrix (Beddard), megascolecid Periyonx sp., octochaetid Lennogaster pusillus (Stephenson) and megascolecid Amynthas corticis (Baird), belonging to four families were found in the landscape. D. nepalensis had the widest distribution. Eutyphoeus sp., A. parva and Periyonx sp. were found only in forest ecosystems and L. pusillus and A. corticis only in agroecosystems. Total density of earthworms was highest under pine forest and species richness was greatest under the broad-leaved forest. Density and biomass of D. nepalensis and L. pusillus varied significantly between different years of cropping under rainfed agriculture receiving oak based or pine based organic inputs. Forest ecosystems had a mixed population of endemic and exotic species, whereas in agroecosystems endemics dominated. Epigeic species were the dominant functional group under broad-leaved forest and pine – broad-leaved mixed forests, whilst endogeic species were dominant under the pine forest. Irrigated agroecosystems receiving oak-based as well as pine-based organic inputs supported only endogeics, whereas both endogeic and epi-anecic species were observed in rainfed agroecosystems. This suggests that distribution of functional groups is determined by land use practices. Eutyphoeus sp. was the only species that showed a significant positive correlation with moisture and a negative correlation with pH and organic carbon. D. nepalensis and A. parva occurred under forest ecosystems and showed a significant positive correlation with lignin and C/N ratio, and a negative correlation with litter polyphenol concentration. Soil parameters and FYM-characteristics did not show any significant correlation with species occurring under agroecosystems. D. nepalensis, which is an endogeic but with a wide ecological amplitude, and the epigeic A. parva, present in large numbers in pine forest, are the two species which could be promoted for inoculation into litter-FYM based organic residue management pits.'], [\"Global data sets of serious agricultural weeds (1348 species), widespread agricultural weeds (1041 species), and threatening natural area invaders (381 species) were assembled, and taxonomic patterns among these data sets were compared to gain insights into how these groups differ ecologically. Angiosperm taxonomic groups (families, orders and subclasses) were tested for over- and under-representation using resampling tests, and ecological characteristics of plant families were correlated with the prominence of each family in the data sets. As predicted by Baker's previously proposed attributes of ‘ideal’ weeds, many over-represented families among agricultural weeds contained primarily herbaceous, rapidly reproducing, abiotically dispersed species. The natural area invaders, in contrast, were represented by a more ecologically diverse range of families and were over-represented by more largely woody families. Families with at least some abiotically pollinated species averaged significantly higher proportions of natural area invaders (p = 0·001) and agricultural weeds (p < 0·001) than biotically pollinated families. Families containing climbing species were more highly represented among natural area invaders than families without climbers (p < 0·009). While all non-native plants may carry some risk of becoming natural area invaders, this taxonomic analysis suggests that plants with amongst the highest risk of becoming natural area invaders worldwide include: species that are primarily aquatic or semi-aquatic, grasses, nitrogen-fixers, climbers, and clonal trees. Only 25% of natural area invaders were serious agricultural weeds, so quarantine legislation aimed at curbing the introduction of new agricultural weeds will be unlikely to prevent the introduction of most natural area invaders.\"], ['Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) describes a growing family of approaches and methods to enable local people to share, enhance and analyze their knowledge of life and conditions, to plan and to act. PRA has sources in activist participatory research, agroecosystem analysis, applied anthropology, field research on farming systems, and rapid rural appraisal (RRA). In RRA information is more elicited and extracted by outsiders; in PRA it is more shared and owned by local people. Participatory methods include mapping and modeling, transect walks, matrix scoring, seasonal calendars, trend and change analysis, well-being and wealth ranking and grouping, and analytical diagramming. PRA applications include natural resources management, agriculture, poverty and social programs, and health and food security. Dominant behavior by outsiders may explain why it has taken until the 1990s for the analytical capabilities of local people to be better recognized and for PRA to emerge, grow and spread.'], [\"ble development is an equitable, empowering, environmentally sound, economically viable process of growth. Energy is the key indicator of sustainable development. About 74% of the population of India live in rural areas. 80% of their energy needs are derived from biomass. About 92% of this energy is consumed in cooking activity. Women play a major role in biofuel management. Rural women's perspective in sustainable development is therefore critical.Declining biofuel resources, poor quality of the available biofuels and inefficient devices have pushed women into greater hardships. This paper examines the role of rural women in biomass management. The energy resources that rural women use, the strategy that the government and other organisations have adopted to alleviate rural energy problems and how these strategies have benefited women and improved their quality of life, the importance of incorporating the concept of “gender and development” in alternative energy strategies to achieve the objectives of sustainable development are discussed in this paper.\"], ['The phylogenetic relationships among 12 genera of treefrogs (Family, Rhacophoridae), were investigated based on a large sequence data set, including five nuclear (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, proopiomelanocortin, recombination activating gene 1, tyrosinase, rhodopsin) and three mitochondrial (partial 12S and 16S ribosomal RNA and the complete valine t-RNA) genes. Phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear gene sequences resolved three major clades. The first group included Philautus, Pseudophilautus, Kurixalus, Gracixalus, and Theloderma moloch; Pseudophilautus and Kurixalus were sister taxa. The second group consisted of Nyctixalus and Theloderma. The third group contained Feihyla, Polypedates, Rhacophorus, and Chiromantis vittatus; Polypedates and Feihyla were sister taxa. Analyses of the nuclear and mitochondrial genes supported the following results: (1) Genus Liuixalus formed the sister group of all other rhacophorines. (2) Philautus, Theloderma, and Chiromantis were not resolved as monophyletic genera. Four groups, including Philautus ocellatus and P. hainanus, P. longchuanensis and P. gryllus, P. banaensis, and P. quyeti nested well within the genera Liuixalus, Pseudophilautus, Kurixalus, and Gracixalus, respectively. (3) Theloderma moloch and Chiromantis vittatus did not cluster with other species of Theloderma and Chiromantis, respectively. Foam nesting evolved only once, as did laying eggs in a jelly-like matrix containing some bubbles. Terrestrial direct development evolved twice in the Rhacophoridae.'], ['r SummaryThis chapter discusses different aspects of the geographic distribution of muddy coasts. Muddy coasts have been defined as land-sea transitions that are entirely or in substantial part composed of muddy sediments. The major mudflat/salt-marsh/mangrove system is developed in the shelter of Cojimies Peninsula, reaching as far north as the town of Muisne. Shrimp ponds have been extensively excavated in the salt marshes. It is found that between Cojimies Peninsula and the Gulf of Guayaquil in the south, mangrove-fringed muddy shore deposits are once more restricted to the northern shores of some estuaries. The Patagonian coast of Argentina remains macrotidal almost up to the mouth of the Rio Negro in the north, being characterized by numerous small estuarine wetlands associated with river mouths and lagoons. Most of the smaller Caribbean islands and the Bahamas are characterized by microtidal conditions and steeply rising hinterlands that preclude the development of laterally extensive muddy shores.'], ['This study focussed on the comparative impact of young high density plantations of two Albizia species (Albizia lebbeck and Albizia procera) on the soil redevelopment process during early phase of mine spoil restoration in a dry tropical environment. Plant-hostile features such as high levels of pyrites, etc. were not present. We compared vegetational (biomass, net primary production (NPP), production efficiency, litter fall and its decomposition rate) and soil characters (soil nutrients, microbial biomass and N-mineralization rate) for these plantations. The A. lebbeck plantation accumulated greater biomass and exhibited higher net primary production than the A. procera plantation. The tree layer NPP of A. lebbeck plantation at 6 years age (25.4\\xa0t\\xa0ha−1 years−1) was even higher than that of native dry deciduous forest. The short-lived components (foliage, fine roots) accounted for a greater proportion of ecosystem function (productivity) than the long-lived component (stem). The efficiency of foliage for NPP was greater in A. lebbeck than in A. procera. Decomposition of leaf litter of A. lebbeck was faster than that of A. procera. Ninety five percent mass loss of leaf litter would require 922 days in A. lebbeck and 1328 days in A. procera. Amounts of N and P deposition through leaf fall and release of these nutrients increased with the age of plantation in both species but were higher for A. lebbeck plantation. There was a significant improvement in soil properties due to plantation of both species, but the organic C and kjeldahl N levels were higher in A. lebbeck plantation as were the N-mineralization rates and soil microbial biomass. The proportional increase in soil biomass was much higher than that in soil organic C. The study indicated that the restoration efficiency of A. lebbeck was greater than that of A. procera.'], [\"ting covers the period September 1, 1997 through to October 31, 1997.

About 15–30% of the total amount of residue generated during coal combustion is fly ash (FA). FA is generally alkaline in nature and contains many toxic metals like Cr, Pb, Hg, As and Cd along with many essential elements like S, B, Ca, Na, Fe, Zn, Mn and P. Dumped FA contaminates the biosphere by mobilization of its fine particles and hazardous metals. Despite the negative environmental impact of FA, coal continues to be a major source of power production in India and therefore FA disposal is a major environmental issue. To overcome this problem, FA dumping sites have been started as a potential resource for biomass production of tree species. Phytoremediation is a strategy that uses plants to degrade, stabilize, and remove contaminants from soils, water and waste FA. Phytomanagement of FA is based on the plants' root systems, high biomass, woody nature, native nature, and resistance to pH, salinity, and toxic metals. Recently Indian researchers mostly from the National Botanical Research Institute have been working on phytoremediation and revegetation of FA dykes, inoculation of bacterial strains for reducing FA stress and biomass production from FA dykes. Many international researchers have worked on reclamation, revegetation and utilization of FA. FA utilization saves resources, mainly land (topsoil), water, coal, limestone and chemical fertilizer. Safe utilization of FA is a major concern around the world and regulatory bodies are enforcing stringent rules for the proper management of FA. This article summarizes various viable avenues in India for FA utilization and environmental management.\"], [\"I use three separate data bases to examine recipient community and site factors that might be influencing the establishment, persistence, and distribution of avian exotics. All in all, about half the variance between islands/regions in their numbers of successfully and unsuccessfully introduced species can be accounted for by recipient site-specific variables; the most important correlate of success is the number of native species extinctions over about the last 3000 years, which reflects the degree of human activity and habitat destruction and deterioration through intrusions of exotic predators, herbivores, and parasites. Consequently, the number of exotic species gained is close to the number of species lost through extinction. Even after controlling for avian extinctions, island area correlates positively with introduced species number. Invasion success does not decline significantly with the richness of the native avifauna (after controlling for the effects of extinctions and island area) nor the variety of potential mammalian predators. The relative proportion of extinct native species across islands/regions is negatively correlated with area and positively correlated with introduced species number and the number of endemic species. A strong correlation exists between the number of successes and the number of failures, attesting to the role of persistent acclimatization societies in increasing species numbers despite high failure rates. The relative success to failure rate increases with the number of extinct native species. The correlation between introductions and native extinctions seems to arise because native birds are usually more common, if not restricted, to native habitats while introduced birds are primary occupants of disturbed and open habitats. As more of an island's area is converted to urban, agricultural and disturbed habitats or altered through the introduction of herbivores and exotic predators, most natives lose good living space while most introduced birds, that frequent open and disturbed areas and have evolved in predator-rich areas, gain habitat.I find little support for the notion that rich avifaunas in themselves repel the establishment of avian invaders at the level of whole islands or archipelagoes. However, interactions between established exotics and natives may be influencing habitat distributions of species in both sets within islands. In both man-made habitats and native forest habitats, exotic species number and the relative abundance of exotic birds is negatively related to the number of native species. After accounting for this local variation, exotic species number is positively related to exotic species number for the entire island/region. In local surveys the relative abundance of exotic birds compared to native birds is affected by habitat (non-native habitats have more exotics) and also by the numbers of species of exotics and natives on the island. The relative importance of biotic interactions like competition, apparent competition through differential disease transmission or susceptibility, and predation in shaping the abundance and habitat affinities of exotics and native species can be difficult to unravel when regional affects are so important.\"], ['Persistent organochlorines in air, river water and sediment samples were analysed from eastern and southern Asia (India, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia) and Oceania (Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands) to elucidate their geographical distribution in tropical environment. The concentrations of organochlorines in these abiotic samples collected from Taiwan, Japan and Australia were also monitored for comparison. Atmospheric and hydrospheric concentrations of HCHs (hexachlorocyclohexanes) and DDTs (DDT and its metabolites) in the tropical developing countries were apparently higher than those observed in the developed nations, suggesting extensive usage of these chemicals in the lower latitudes. CHLs (chlordane compounds) and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) were also occasionally observed at higher levels in the tropics, implying that their usage area is also expanding southward. Distribution patterns of organochlorines in sediments showed smaller spatial variations on global terms, indicating that the chemicals released in the tropical environment are dispersed rapidly through air and water and retained less in sediments. The ratios of organochlorine concentrations in sediment and water phases were positively correlated with the latitude of sampling, suggesting that persistent and semivolatile compounds discharged in the tropics tend to be redistributed on a global scale.'], ['The Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) Lameta Formation exposed around Jabalpur in central India comprises a pedogenically modified fluvial succession. Accumulation of early diagenetic calcite cement during penecontemporaneous pedogenesis has transformed the fluvial sandstones into calcareous sandstones. The microscopic features of the palaeosol material include floating grain fabric, root traces, laminated micrite-microspar, micrite envelopes and corona structures, illuvial clay envelopes, poikilotopic spars and minor amounts of siliceous grain and void cutans.The palaeosol profiles of the Lameta Formation can be classified into eleven different types, nine of which are comparable to present-day mature aridisols and two to inceptisols. Nine to thirteen palaeosol profiles are present in the individual sections of the Lameta Formation within the study area. Each profile comprises two to four distinct pedohorizons arranged in vertical succession. There are six types of pedohorizons present in the area of study, namely, partly altered hosts, light-coloured and poorly cemented horizons, horizons with root traces and root-related alterations, horizons of subspherical glaebules, horizons of platy-fused glaebules and subhorizontal root traces and horizons with solution features. They show many characteristics similar to the present-day soil horizons, for example those termed C, Bk, K, A and E by pedologists.The palaeosol characteristics show correspondence to the nature of fluvial channel migration and the depth of the groundwater table (controlled by the geomorphic setting). A shallow groundwater table favoured the development of rootmat-bearing and gleyed horizons. Horizons with vertical root traces and glaebules occur where the groundwater table was low. Mature and thin palaeosols developed in those parts of the Lameta fluvial tract that were characterized by stable channels and wide floodplains. In contrast, thin and comparatively immature soils occurred in the parts where laterally migrating channels were operative.The characteristics of the Lameta palaeosols suggest that a hot and semiarid climate prevailed for most of the time represented by the Lameta Formation, but short-term wet spells occurred during the initial and the terminal phases of the Lameta accumulation. The low latitudinal palaeoposition of India and the absence of the palaeo-monsoon circulation might have produced the hot and semiarid climatic setting during this time.'], ['The popular view of primary and old secondary tropical rainforests is that they occur on infertile soils, have most of the nutrients in the above-ground living matter, and maintain a high production by rapid and efficient nutrient cycling. This paradigm pervades much land use planning rationale in forested areas in the tropics.In this paper, rainforest nutrient cycles are outlined and the methodological difficulties of work on them are emphasized. There is a shortage of information on nearly every aspect. It is concluded that the popular view is not fully justified even from the available data. Some rainforests occur on fertile soils with a high proportion of at least some nutrients below ground. In some cases there appears to be a substantial yearly loss of nutrients from the ecosystem and sometimes nutrient cycling is slow.Rainforest nutrition is immensely complex and shows many differences from one area to another. It is concluded that much more research is necessary before useful generalizations are possible.'], [\"One of the three cardinal aspirations of Libya's 1973–1975 Three-Year Development Plan was to build regime support by redistributing her oil wealth as extensively as possible among the various segments of her population. Housing was a key redistributive mechanism, with 18.4% (the highest) of the total budget for the Plan Period being allocated to it. Similarly, the Five-Year Transformation Plan of 1976–1980, which was designed as a rational supplement to the 1973–1975 Plan, used housing programmes to perform dual operations: a redistributive function by providing heavily subsidized mass housing and a productivity role by encouraging Libyans to acquire building construction skills. Housing investment by the Libyan State has thus intrinsically been a function of political and social, rather than economic, considerations.Benghazi City has been a major beneficiary of this subsidized mass housing policy. This is because Libya's settlement pattern, which is marked by a high degree of primacy and intense spatial inequalities among regions, is fundamentally separated into two disjointed urban systems polarised on Tripoli and Benghazi.It is against this background that this paper explores the context in which housing activity has been undertaken in the city especially during the 1973–1975 and 1976–1980 Development Plan Periods. A proper understanding of the city's settlement system in its social, spatial and hierarchical dimensions is essential for the definition of programmes for spatial expansion and in appraising the repercussions of alternative housing programmes.\"], ['Darjeeling and Sikkim Himalayas, a part of Eastern Himalayan Hotspot, is characterized by its richness of plant diversity. Herbal medicine has been one of the most popular and reliable healing practices among the different ethnic groups of this region for ages. However, the lack of documentation practice by the traditional healers has led to obscurity regarding the efficacy of herbal medicine among the present generation, though they have to depend on the same quite often. Meanwhile, several reviews have attempted to document the plants used for the treatment of diabetes from this region, but interestingly, very few research works can be obtained regarding the characterization of antidiabetic properties of the plants of this region. Therefore, it demands a better understanding of the potentiality of these plants in the purview of scientific evidence.

Biomass energy lost from the submerged land has to be compared to the electrical energy generated, for which we develop four alternative formulations of the net-energy function. The design problem is posed as an LP problem and is solved for two sites in India. Our results show that the proposed designs may not be viable in net-energy terms, whereas a marginal reduction in the generation capacity could lead to an optimal design that gives substantial savings in the submerged area. Allowing seasonal variations in the hydroelectric generation capacity also reduces the reservoir size. A mixed hydro-wood generation system is then examined and is found to be viable.'], ['Structuring soils on a landscape level of scale is a necessary prerequisite for an extrapolation of point results to greater areas (upscaling), not only in soil genetic research but also for ecological purposes. In this respect the catena concept provides a very useful paradigm to decipher soil pattern and related regular trends in soil chemical properties on the landscape scale. Using this approach we created types of matter distribution out of frequently recurring patterns. Three archetypes of catenas can be distinguished for soil components depending on the (im-)mobilization processes and hydrological regimes: (i) transformation catenas showing no gains or losses of the element/soil component under study (only transformation processes working), (ii) leaching catenas with losses in at least part of the catena and no accompanying elemental gains in other parts, and (iii) accumulation catenas showing gains in at least part of the catena but no losses elsewhere in the catena. From a spatial regular pattern of element losses combined with gains in one catena a translocation catena can be inferred. Such catenas can be regarded as a subgroup of the leaching- or accumulation-type, but exclude the transformation-type. Catenas which cover geomorphic units of distinctly different ages belong to the chrono catenas, a subgroup of either the transformation-, leaching-, or accumulation-type. The spatial arrangement and extension of depletion/accumulation areas and flow directions of translocated elements/soil components (down-/upslope) lead to a further subdivision of the catena types.'], ['The use of molecular techniques is rapidly growing as the tools have become more diverse and powerful, more widely available, and easier to implement. Molecular analyses are able to elucidate information about target weeds that is critical to improving control success, such as taxonomic clarification, evidence of hybridization and cryptic species, better development of test plant lists, population structure and origin of invasions. Similarly, molecular approaches can improve our knowledge of biological control agents, providing taxonomic clarity, identification of immature arthropods and fungal pathogens, and description of genetic variability in agents. Molecular tools also allow easier identification of host associations and provide a tool for post-release evaluation and tracking of agents. This review provides an overview of how to use molecular approaches in biological control of weeds, with the aim of assisting the adoption and facilitating fruitful collaboration between scientists studying the biology and ecology of agents and their targets and those with skills using molecular approaches.

We hope that such a review will help to determine the directions which geological-geophysical research should take within the Upper Mantle Project.We apply the term platform, a synonym of craton, to any large portion of the continental crust bounded by folded belts or sometimes by oceans, and characterized by the following specific features: (a) tectonic stability over a very long period (several hundreds of million years or more); (b) general tectonic homogeneity (despite a complex inner structure and different times of formation of its separate parts); (c) an absence of high gradients of movement.Shields are elements of platforms which have been characterized by a tendency towards slow uplift over periods of hundreds of million years.

Continental slopes underlie some 12% of the world ocean's surface area. Their importance to ocean circulation is out of proportion, since most of the major ocean currents flow over them and are in various ways affected by their topography. Superimposed on the typical upwelling regime are variations in the strength of the alongshore flow in response to changes of the wind stress. Coastal currents driven by density differences due to river runoff are common on continental shelves but reach to the upper slope only in a few places. Strong surface cooling, in the absence of significant salinity contrasts, produces cold and heavy coastal waters, the opposite of the coastal freshening case. Shallow water cools off rapidly, as its temperature also becomes uniform due to thermal convection, and tends to underflow less completely cooled deeper water. It is found that the fundamental slope effect examined above turns up in a different guise if the angular momentum balance of a fluid column fixed in space is considered instead of vorticity, allowing for external torques as well as the torque due to momentum advection.\"], ['References to either indigenous uses or the results of controlled assays are numerous for species of Phyllanthus (Euphorbiaceae).

Among these, arecanut, cardamom, cashew, cinchona, cocoa, coconut, coffee, oil palm, palmyra, rubber, tea, and wattle are the most important ones with much commercial value to the economy of the third world. This chapter describes the agronomy and economy of the most important of these, arecanut, cashew nut, and coconut. All the three are grown to varying extent on the Asian, African, and the Latin American continents, and individually and collectively, contribute much to the economy of the nations in these three continents. And each of them has a checkered history of its own. For instance, cashew nut came from Brazil, the country of its origin, to the coast of Malabar, along the Arabian Sea, in Southern India to the State of Kerala with the Portuguese colonizers and spread from thereon, within the country and to its neighboring regions, after the British colonizers began patronizing it, as a delicious nut that goes very well with the pre-dinner evening Scotch, which is now a common feature in many social functions and is now contributing much to the Indian economy. While arecanut and coconut contribute much to the economy of Asian and Southeast Asian countries, cashew nut has come to occupy an important position in the Asian economy, in particular Indian, and to some extent African. Arecanut is primarily grown for its masticatory nuts, popularly known as betel nut or “supari,” as is popularly known in Northern India and Pakistan. No social or religious function in either of these two countries is complete without the supari being offered to the guest or participant in the festivities. India exports considerable quantity of arecanut to Pakistan. Each section of the chapter devoted to the individual crop deals with several aspects of production, the crop's place in world economy vis-à-vis the countries where it is grown, and the ravages of pestilence, such as which is caused by the tea mosquito bug (TMB) in cashew nut, for which there still is no permanent cure which can be devastating to the cashew crop or the root wilt of coconut or the “koleroga” or “Mahali” (fruit rot) of arecanut. The review also includes the relevance of a refreshing new concept, developed by the author, which is now universally known as “The Nutrient Buffer Power Concept,” in the nutrition of these crops, which offers much scope for a breakthrough in productivity.\"], ['r SummaryThis chapter examines the performance of a high-resolution mesoscale tropical prediction model. There are basically two types of mesoscale models, including quasistatic models and nonhydrostatic mesoscale models. The quasistatic models make use of horizontal resolutions of the order of 50 km or larger and can resolve mesoscale phenomena whose scale is of the order of a few hundred kilometers. The nonhydrostatic mesoscale models use a horizontal resolution of less than 5 km. The physical parametrizations of the model are largely based on the developments from global spectral model. These include shallow and deep moist convection, detailed calculation of radiative processes including cloud feedback processes, and a variable solar zenith angle. The surface fluxes are based on similarity theory and are coupled to the computation of surface hydrology and surface energy balance and they distinguish between the stable and unstable surface layers. The dynamical aspects of the regional model are also elaborated.'], ['References to either indigenous uses or the results of controlled assays are numerous for species of Pkyllanthus (Euphorbiaceae). These citations have been arranged by subgenus, section, subsection and species and will be published as three separate papers, followed by a paper discussing the apparent clustering of some uses or effects within taxa. This paper, the first of the series, covers the subgenera Isocladus, Kirganelia, Cicca and Emblica.'], ['SHRIMP dating of magmatic zircons from granitoid gneisses and charnockites of the Trivandrum and Nagercoil Blocks in the granulite terrane of southernmost India yielded well-defined protolith emplacement ages between 1765 and ca. 2100\\xa0Ma and also document variable recrystallization and/or lead-loss during the late Neoproterozoic Pan-African event at around 540\\xa0Ma. Hf-in-zircon and whole rock Nd isotopic data suggest that the granitoid host rocks were derived from mixed crustal sources, and Hf–Nd model ages vary between 2.2 and 2.8\\xa0Ga. A gabbroic dyke, emplaced into a charnockite protolith and deformed together with it, only contained metamorphic zircon whose mean age of 542.3\\xa0±\\xa04.0\\xa0Ma reflects the peak of granulite–facies metamorphism during the Pan-African high-grade event. The Sm–Nd whole-rock isotopic system of several granitoid samples dated in this study was significantly disturbed during granulite–facies metamorphism, most likely due to a CO2-rich fluid phase. Whole-rock Nd model ages are consistently older than zircon-derived Hf model ages.The Trivandrum and Nagercoil Blocks are reinterpreted as a single tectono-metamorphic terrane predominantly consisting of Palaeoproterozoic granitoids interlayered with supracrustal rocks that must be older than ca. 2100\\xa0Ma. Ductile deformation, migmatization and anatexis have obliterated the original rock relationships. These blocks probably have their counterpart in the Highland Complex of neighbouring Sri Lanka and in the high-grade Palaeoproterozoic terrane of southern Madagascar. We speculate that the southern Indian khondalites may have their counterparts in the khondalite belt of the North China Craton.'], ['Energy planning of any region should be based on existing levels of energy consumption. Sectorwise disaggregated information of energy usage is developed for the Uttara Kannada District to assist in the regional energy planning exercise. This paper provides comparative analyses of village level domestic energy consumption patterns across coastal, interior, hilly and plain zones considering regional and seasonal variations. Cooking, water heating and space heating are the major end use activities. The results, based on eighteen months of field research in five taluks of Uttara Kannada, reveal that the average energy consumption norm does vary significantly for cooking and water heating in various seasons across the zones. Among the five taluks, 90 villages (out of 119) and all divisions of Kumta town in the Kumta taluk and 190–220 randomly selected households in selected villages of Sirsi, Mundgod, Siddapur and Ankola were studied. A survey of 1304 households from 90 villages in the Kumta taluk shows that most of them still use traditional stoves for cooking (97.92%) and water heating (98.3%). Average consumption (kg/person/day) for cooking ranges from 2.01±1.49 (coastal) to 2.32±2.09 (hilly). Seasonwise cooking fuel wood requirement for coast and hilly zones, ranges from 1.98 and 2.22 (summer) to 2.11 and 2.51 (monsoon), respectively, while for water heating (for bath and washing), it ranges from 1.17±0.02 (coast) to 1.63±0.05 (hilly). Seasonal variation is evident from the range 1.12 and 1.53 (summer) to 1.22 and 1.73 (monsoon) for coastal and hilly zones, respectively. Analysis of other sources of energy for domestic purposes shows that kerosene is used for cooking and lighting in the coast. Kerosene consumption (l/person/month) for cooking ranges from 0.05 (hilly) to 0.34 (coast) and for lighting ranges from 0.75 (coast) to 0.99 (hilly). Availability of bioresources in hilly zone is the main reason for less consumption of kerosene for cooking. In the hilly zone, electrification of all households has not been possible, as they are scattered. Because of the erratic supply during all seasons (especially monsoon), electrified households also depend on kerosene for lighting. Based on fuel consumption norms (regionwise, seasonwise and end usewise), (a) the total fuel wood required (cooking, water heating, space heating, jaggery making and parboiling) works out to 1.668,698.23 tonnes/year, (b) the electricity demand, excluding irrigation, is about 32.65 million kWh/year and (c) the kerosene demand for cooking and water heating is about 15.86 million litres per year.'], ['r SummaryThis chapter discusses the ecophysiology of trees of seasonally dry tropics. This chapter focuses on the seasonally dry tropical and subtropical woodlands and forests of the world, and differentiates woodland from forest on the basis of percentage canopy cover. It presents the physiological and structural properties that determine water and gas exchange relationships of trees in seasonally dry tropical habitats. These properties must eventually be linked to the larger-scale processes to explain patterns of productivity and ecosystem function. Seasonally dry forests represent an important class of vegetation, globally. Temperature and light availability are infrequently limiting for productivity. However, water can be very limiting for a significant part of the year in the majority, but not for all seasonally dry woodlands and forests. Deciduous and evergreen species represent two ends of a continuum of leaf lifespan. The chapter discusses the cost-benefit analyses for leaves of savanna trees, and mentions that construction costs of leaves can be calculated from detailed investigations of biochemical pathways utilized during construction of the principal components of leaves.'], ['r SummaryThe chapter reviews the meteorological phenomena that are associated with topography. The study of airflow past mountains is complicated by the wide range of scales that must be considered. The ratios of the mountain width to each of the natural length scales are important in determining the physical regime of the flow. This idea is emphasized in the chapter by treating the effects of boundary layers and buoyancy. The theory of two-dimensional mountain waves with the help of its governing equations is presented and the observations of mountain waves are presented. The chapter also examines the influence of the boundary layer on mountain flows and slope winds and mountain and valley winds. It considers the perturbation to the wind flow caused by a mountain of intermediate scale where the rotation of the Earth cannot be neglected. For this the flow near mesoscale and synoptic-scale mountains, quasi-geostrophic flow over a mountain, the effect of inertia on the flow over mesoscale mountains, and theories of lee cyclogenesis are discussed. Finally the chapter describes planetary-scale mountain waves; a vertically integrated model of topographically forced planetary waves; the vertical structure of planetary waves; models of stationary planetary waves allowing meridional propagation and lateral; and variation in the background wind.'], [\"r SummaryThe purpose of this chapter is to discuss the origin and cytogenetics rice. Rice and wheat are the most important food plants of man. The chapter reviews that the importance of rice is much more than the production figures would indicate. About 90% of the rice is produced and consumed in South and Southeast Asia. It forms the staple food of 54% of all humans, against 34% of wheat and only 4% of maize. Compared to its importance, much less is known about the genetics of rice than of other crop plants. The chapter also discusses that the cultivated rice's of the world belong to two species, sativa, and glaberrima. Commonly known as Asiatic rices, sativa is the species cultivated throughout the rice-growing areas of the world. However, it is in South and Southeast Asia, where most of the rice is grown, that both sativa and wild rice's occur in great profusion and variability.\"]]\n",
