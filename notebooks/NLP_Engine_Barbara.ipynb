Here, we evaluate the effects of multiple forms of anthropogenic disturbance across a precipitation gradient on the abundance of pathogen-infected small mammal hosts in a multi-host, multi-pathogen system in central Kenya. Our results suggest that conversion to cropland and wildlife loss alone drive systematic increases in rodent-borne pathogen prevalence, but that pastoral conversion has no such systematic effects. The effects are most likely explained both by changes in total small mammal abundance, and by changes in relative abundance of a few high-competence species, although changes in vector assemblages may also be involved. Several pathogens responded to interactions between disturbance type and climatic conditions, suggesting the potential for synergistic effects of anthropogenic disturbance and climate change on the distribution of disease risk. Overall, these results indicate that conservation can be an effective tool for reducing abundance of rodent-borne pathogens in some contexts (e.g. wildlife loss alone); however, given the strong variation in effects across disturbance types, pathogen taxa and environmental conditions, the use of conservation as public health interventions will need to be carefully tailored to specific pathogens and human contexts.This article is part of the themed issue \\'Conservation, biodiversity and infectious disease: scientific evidence and policy implications\\'.\"'], ['Detecting signals of chronic shedding to explain pathogen persistence: Leptospira interrogans in California sea lions,\"By: Buhnerkempe, Michael G.; Prager, Katherine C.; Strelioff, Christopher C.; et al.\",JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY  Volume: 86   Issue: 3   Pages: 460-472   Published: MAY 2017,\"Identifying mechanisms driving pathogen persistence is a vital component of wildlife disease ecology and control. Asymptomatic, chronically infected individuals are an oft-cited potential reservoir of infection, but demonstrations of the importance of chronic shedding to pathogen persistence at the population-level remain scarce. Studying chronic shedding using commonly collected disease data is hampered by numerous challenges, including short-term surveillance that focuses on single epidemics and acutely ill individuals, the subtle dynamical influence of chronic shedding relative to more obvious epidemic drivers, and poor ability to differentiate between the effects of population prevalence of chronic shedding vs. intensity and duration of chronic shedding in individuals. We use chronic shedding of Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona in California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) as a case study to illustrate how these challenges can be addressed. Using leptospirosis-induced strands as a measure of disease incidence, we fit models with and without chronic shedding, and with different seasonal drivers, to determine the time-scale over which chronic shedding is detectable and the interactions between chronic shedding and seasonal drivers needed to explain persistence and outbreak patterns. Chronic shedding can enable persistence of L.interrogans within the sea lion population. However, the importance of chronic shedding was only apparent when surveillance data included at least two outbreaks and the intervening inter-epidemic trough during which fadeout of transmission was most likely. Seasonal transmission, as opposed to seasonal recruitment of susceptibles, was the dominant driver of seasonality in this system, and both seasonal factors had limited impact on long-term pathogen persistence. We show that the temporal extent of surveillance data can have a dramatic impact on inferences about population processes, where the failure to identify both short- and long-term ecological drivers can have cascading impacts on understanding higher order ecological phenomena, such as pathogen persistence.\"'], ['Broad and flexible stable isotope niches in invasive non-native Rattus spp. in anthropogenic and natural habitats of central eastern Madagascar,\"By: Dammhahn, Melanie; Randriamoria, Toky M.; Goodman, Steven M.\",BMC ECOLOGY  Volume: 17     Article Number: 16   Published: APR 17 2017,\"Background: Rodents of the genus Rattus are among the most pervasive and successful invasive species, causing major vicissitudes in native ecological communities. A broad and flexible generalist diet has been suggested as key to the invasion success of Rattus spp. Here, we use an indirect approach to better understand foraging niche width, plasticity, and overlap within and between introduced Rattus spp. in anthropogenic habitats and natural humid forests of Madagascar.Results: Based on stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values measured in hair samples of 589 individual rodents, we found that Rattus rattus had an extremely wide foraging niche, encompassing the isotopic space covered by a complete endemic forest-dwelling Malagasy small mammal community. Comparisons of Bayesian standard ellipses, as well as (multivariate) mixed-modeling analyses, revealed that the stable isotope niche of R. rattus tended to change seasonally and differed between natural forests and anthropogenic habitats, indicating plasticity in feeding niches. In co-occurrence, R. rattus and Rattus norvegicus partitioned feeding niches. Isotopic mismatch of signatures of individual R. rattus and the habitat in which they were captured, indicate frequent dispersal movements for this species between natural forest and anthropogenic habitats.Conclusions: Since R. rattus are known to transmit a number of zoonoses, potentially affecting communities of endemic small mammals, as well as humans, these movements presumably increase transmission potential. Our results suggest that due to their generalist diet and potential movement between natural forest and anthropogenic habitats, Rattus spp. might affect native forest-dependent Malagasy rodents as competitors, predators, and disease vectors. The combination of these effects helps explain the invasion success of Rattus spp. and the detrimental effects of this genus on the endemic Malagasy rodent fauna.\"'], ['Picky eaters are rare: DNA-based blood meal analysis of Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) species from the United States,\"By: Hopken, Matthew W.; Ryan, Bonnie M.; Huyvaert, Kathryn P.; et al.\",PARASITES & VECTORS  Volume: 10     Article Number: 169   Published: APR 4 2017,\"Background: Biting midges in the genus Culicoides (Diptera; Ceratopogonidae) have been implicated in the transmission of a number of parasites and highly pathogenic viruses. In North America, the complete transmission cycles of many of these pathogens need further elucidation. One way to increase our knowledge about the evolution and ecology of Culicoides species and the pathogens they transmit is to document the diversity of vertebrate hosts that Culicoides feed upon. Our objective was to identify the diversity of Culicoides hosts in the United States.Results: We sequenced two vertebrate mitochondrial genes (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 and cytochrome b) from blood-engorged Culicoides to identify Culicoides species and their blood meals. We detected the mitochondrial DNA of 12 host species from seven different Culicoides species from three states. The majority of the identified blood meals were from the C. variipennis species complex in California. The hosts included both mammals and birds. We documented new host records for some of the Culicoides species collected. The majority of the mammalian hosts were large ungulate species but we also detected a lagomorph and a carnivore. The bird species that were detected included house finch and emu; the latter is evidence that the species in the C. variipennis species complex are not strictly mammalophilic.Conclusions: These results demonstrate that Culicoides will feed on multiple classes of vertebrates and may be more opportunistic in regards to host choice than previously thought. This knowledge can help with identification of susceptible host species, pathogen reservoirs, and new vector species which, in turn, will improve disease outbreak risk assessments.\"'], ['Hung out to dry? Intraspecific variation in water loss in a hibernating bat,\"By: Klug-Baerwald, Brandon J.; Brigham, R. Mark\",OECOLOGIA  Volume: 183   Issue: 4   Pages: 977-985   Published: APR 2017,\"Hibernation is a period of water deficit for some small mammals, and humidity strongly influences hibernation patterns. Dry conditions reduce length of torpor bouts, stimulate arousals, and decrease overwinter survival. To mitigate these effects, many small mammals hibernate in near saturated (100% RH) conditions. However, big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) hibernate in a wider variety of conditions and tolerate lower humidity than most other bats. To assess arid tolerance in this species, we compared torpid metabolic rates (TMR) and rates of total evaporative water loss (TEWL) between two populations of E. fuscus with differing winter ecologies: one that hibernates in humid karst caves and one that hibernates in relatively dry rock crevices. We used flow-through respirometry to measure TMR and TEWL of bats in humid and dry conditions. Torpid metabolic rates did not differ between populations or with humidity treatments. Rates of TEWL were similar between populations in humid conditions, but higher for cave-hibernating bats than crevice-hibernating bats in dry conditions. Our results suggest that E. fuscus hibernating in arid environments have mechanisms to decrease evaporative water loss that are not evident at more humid sites. Drought tolerance may facilitate the sedentary nature of the species, allowing them to tolerate more variable microclimates during hibernation and thus increasing the availability of overwintering habitat. The ability to survive arid conditions may also lessen the susceptibility of E. fuscus to diseases that affect water balance.\"'], ['Exo-erythrocytic development of avian malaria and related haemosporidian parasites,\"By: Valkiunas, Gediminas; Iezhova, Tatjana A.\",MALARIA JOURNAL  Volume: 16     Article Number: 101   Published: MAR 3 2017,\"Background: Avian malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) and related haemosporidians (Haemosporida) are responsible for diseases which can be severe and even lethal in avian hosts. These parasites cause not only blood pathology, but also damage various organs due to extensive exo-erythrocytic development all over the body, which is not the case during Plasmodium infections in mammals. However, exo-erythrocytic development (tissue merogony or schizogony) remains the most poorly investigated part of life cycle in all groups of wildlife haemosporidian parasites. In spite of remarkable progress in studies of genetic diversity, ecology and evolutionary biology of avian haemosporidians during the past 20 years, there is not much progress in understanding patterns of exo-erythrocytic development in these parasites. The purpose of this review is to overview the main information on exo-erythrocytic development of avian Plasmodium species and related haemosporidian parasites as a baseline for assisting academic and veterinary medicine researchers in morphological identification of these parasites using tissue stages, and to define future research priorities in this field of avian malariology.Methods: The data were considered from peer-reviewed articles and histological material that was accessed in zoological collections in museums of Australia, Europe and the USA. Articles describing tissue stages of avian haemosporidians were included from 1908 to the present. Histological preparations of various organs infected with the exo-erythrocytic stages of different haemosporidian parasites were examined.Results: In all, 229 published articles were included in this review. Exo-erythrocytic stages of avian Plasmodium, Fallisia, Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon, and Akiba species were analysed, compared and illustrated. Morphological characters of tissue stages that can be used for diagnostic purposes were specified.Conclusion: Recent molecular studies combined with histological research show that avian haemosporidians are more virulent than formerly believed. The exo-erythrocytic stages can cause severe disease, especially in non-adapted avian hosts, suggesting the existence of a group of underestimated malignant infections. The development of a given haemosporidian strain can be markedly different in different avian hosts, resulting in significantly different virulence. A methodology combining the traditional histology techniques with molecular diagnostic tools is essential to speed research in this field of avian malariology.\"'], ['Demographic, ecological, and physiological responses of ringed seals to an abrupt decline in sea ice availability,\"By: Ferguson, Steven H.; Young, Brent G.; Yurkowski, David J.; et al.\",PEERJ  Volume: 5     Article Number: e2957   Published: FEB 2 2017,\"To assess whether demographic declines of Arctic species at the southern limit of their range will be gradual or punctuated, we compared large-scale environmental patterns including sea ice dynamics to ringed seal (Pusa hispida) reproduction, body condition, recruitment, and stress in Hudson Bay from 2003 to 2013. Aerial surveys suggested a gradual decline in seal density from 1995 to 2013, with the lowest density occurring in 2013. Body condition decreased and stress (cortisol) increased over time in relation to longer open water periods. The 2010 open water period in Hudson Bay coincided with extremes in large-scale atmospheric patterns (North Atlantic Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation, El Nino-Southern Oscillation) resulting in the earliest spring breakup and the latest ice formation on record. The warming event was coincident with high stress level, low ovulation rate, low pregnancy rate, few pups in the Inuit harvest, and observations of sick seals. Results provide evidence of changes in the condition of Arctic marine mammals in relation to climate mediated sea ice dynamics. We conclude that although negative demographic responses of Hudson Bay seals are occurring gradually with diminishing sea ice, a recent episodic environmental event, played a significant role in a punctuated population decline.\"'], ['Joint associations of blood plasma proteins with overwinter survival of a large mammal,\"By: Garnier, Romain; Cheung, Christopher K.; Watt, Kathryn A.; et al.\",ECOLOGY LETTERS  Volume: 20   Issue: 2   Pages: 175-183   Published: FEB 2017,\"In many wild animal populations, hosts are at risk of parasites and malnutrition and resource costs of defence may be difficult to afford. We postulate that proteins, important in homeostasis and immunity, play a complex but central role in condition dependence and resource costs of mammalian immune defence. To test this, we measured plasma concentrations of albumin, total proteins. Self-reactive antibodies and parasite-specific IgG in female Soay sheep. Using a principal component analysis, we found a new metric of condition reflecting individual variation in acquisition, assimilation and/or recycling of plasma proteins that predicted overwinter survival. Controlling for this metric, an age-dependent trade-off between antibody titres and protein reserves emerged, indicating costs of mounting an antibody response: younger individuals survived best when prioritising immunity while older individuals fared better when maintaining high-protein nutritional plane. These findings suggest fascinating roles for protein acquisition and allocation in influencing survival in wild animal populations.\"'], ['Synanthropic Mammals as Potential Hosts of Tick-Borne Pathogens in Panama,\"By: Bermudez, Sergio E.; Gottdenker, Nicole; Krishnvajhala, Aparna; et al.\",PLOS ONE  Volume: 12   Issue: 1     Article Number: e0169047   Published: JAN 6 2017,\"Synanthropic wild mammals can be important hosts for many vector-borne zoonotic pathogens. The aim of this study was determine the exposure of synanthropic mammals to two types of tick-borne pathogens in Panama, spotted fever group Rickettsia (SFGR) and Borrelia relapsing fever (RF) spirochetes. One hundred and thirty-one wild mammals were evaluated, including two gray foxes, two crab-eating foxes (from zoos), four coyotes, 62 opossum and 63 spiny rats captured close to rural towns. To evaluate exposure to SFGR, serum samples from the animals were tested by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using Rickettsia rickettsii and Candidatus Rickettsia amblyommii antigen. Immunoblotting was performed using Borrelia turicatae protein lysates and rGIpQ, to assess infection caused by RF spirochetes. One coyote (25%) and 27 (43%) opossums showed seroreactivity to SFGR. Of these opossums, 11 were seroreactive to C. R. amblyommii. Serological reactivity was not detected to B. turicatae in mammal samples. These findings may reflect a potential role of both mammals in the ecology of tick-borne pathogens in Panama.\"'], ['Evaluation of habitat requirements of small rodents and effectiveness of an ecologically-based management in a hantavirus-endemic natural protected area in Argentina,\"By: Victoria Vadell, Maria; Garcia Erize, Francisco; Gomez Villafane, Isabel Elisa\",INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY  Volume: 12   Issue: 1   Pages: 77-94   Published: JAN 2017,\"Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a severe cardio pulmonary disease transmitted to humans by sylvan rodents found in natural and rural environments. Disease transmission is closely linked to the ecology of animal reservoirs and abiotic factors such as habitat characteristics, season or climatic conditions. The main goals of this research were: to determine the biotic and abiotic factors affecting richness and abundance of rodent species at different spatial scales, to evaluate different methodologies for studying population of small rodents, and to describe and analyze an ecologically-based rodent management experience in a highly touristic area. A 4-year study of small rodent ecology was conducted between April 2007 and August 2011 in the most relevant habitats of El Palmar National Park, Argentina. Management involved a wide range of control and prevention measures, including poisoning, culling and habitat modification. A total of 172 individuals of 5 species were captured with a trapping effort of 13 860 traps-nights (1.24 individuals/100 traps-nights). Five rodent species were captured, including 2 hantavirus-host species, Oligoryzomys nigripes and Akodon azarae. Oligoryzomys nigripes, host of a hantavirus that is pathogenic in humans, was the most abundant species and the only one found in all the studied habitats. Our results are inconsistent with the dilution effect hypothesis. The present study demonstrates that sylvan rodent species, including the hantavirus-host species, have distinct local habitat selection and temporal variation patterns in abundance, which may influence the risk of human exposure to hantavirus and may have practical implications for disease transmission as well as for reservoir management.\"'], ['The Fleas (Siphonaptera) in Iran: Diversity, Host Range, and Medical Importance,\"By: Maleki-Ravasan, Naseh; Solhjouy-Fard, Samaneh; Beaucournu, Jean-Claude; et al.\",PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES  Volume: 11   Issue: 1     Article Number: e0005260   Published: JAN 2017,\"BackgroundFlea-borne diseases have a wide distribution in the world. Studies on the identity, abundance, distribution and seasonality of the potential vectors of pathogenic agents (e.g. Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Rickettsia felis) are necessary tools for controlling and preventing such diseases outbreaks. The improvements of diagnostic tools are partly responsible for an easier detection of otherwise unnoticed agents in the ectoparasitic fauna and as such a good taxonomical knowledge of the potential vectors is crucial. The aims of this study were to make an exhaustive inventory of the literature on the fleas (Siphonaptera) and range of associated hosts in Iran, present their known distribution, and discuss their medical importance.Methodology/Principal FindingsThe data were obtained by an extensive literature review related to medically significant fleas in Iran published before 31st August 2016. The flea-host specificity was then determined using a family and subfamily-oriented criteria to further realize and quantify the shared and exclusive vertebrate hosts of fleas among Iran fleas. The locations sampled and reported in the literature were primarily from human habitation, livestock farms, poultry, and rodents\\' burrows of the 31 provinces of the country. The flea fauna were dominated by seven families, namely the Ceratophyllidae, Leptopsyllidae, Pulicidae, Ctenophthalmidae, Coptopsyllidae, Ischnopsyllidae and Vermipsyllidae. The hosts associated with Iran fleas ranged from the small and large mammals to the birds. Pulicidae were associated with 73% (56/77) of identified host species. Flea-host association analysis indicates that rodents are the common hosts of 5 flea families but some sampling bias results in the reduced number of bird host sampled. Analyses of flea-host relationships at the subfamily level showed that most vertebrates hosted fleas belgonging to 3 subfamilies namely Xenopsyllinae (n = 43), Ctenophthalminae (n = 20) and Amphipsyllinae (n = 17). Meriones persicus was infested by 11 flea subfamilies in the arid, rocky, mountainous regions and Xenopsyllinae were hosted by at least 43 mammal species. These findings place the Persian jird (M. persicus) and the Xenopsyllinae as the major vertebrate and vector hosts of flea-borne diseases in Iran including Yersinia pestis, the etiological agent of plague. We found records of at least seven vector-borne pathogenic agents that can potentially be transmitted by the 117 flea species (or subspecies) of Iran.Conclusions/SignificanceHerein, we performed a thorough inventary of the flea species and their associated hosts, their medical importance and geographic distribution throughout Iran. This exercise allowed assessing the diversity of flea species with the potential flea-borne agents transmission risk in the country by arranging published data on flea-host associations. This information is a first step for issuing public health policies and rodent-flea control campaigns in Iran as well as those interested in the ecology/epidemiology of flea-borne disease.\"'], ['Mammalian biogeography and the Ebola virus in Africa,\"By: Olivero, Jesus; Fa, John E.; Real, Raimundo; et al.\",MAMMAL REVIEW  Volume: 47   Issue: 1   Pages: 24-37   Published: JAN 2017,\"1. Ebola virus is responsible for the fatal Ebola virus disease (EVD).2. Identifying the distribution area of the Ebola virus is crucial for understanding the risk factors conditioning the emergence of new EVD cases. Existing distribution models have underrepresented the potential contribution that reservoir species and vulnerable species make in sustaining the presence of the virus.3. In this paper, we map favourable areas for Ebola virus in Africa according to environmental and zoogeographical descriptors, independent of human-to-human transmissions. We combine two different biogeographical approaches: analysis of mammalian distribution types (chorotypes), and distribution modelling of the Ebola virus.4. We first obtain a model defining the distribution of environmentally favourable areas for the presence of Ebola virus. Based on a review of mammal taxa affected by or suspected of exposure to the Ebola virus, we model favourable areas again, this time according to mammalian chorotypes. We then build a combined model in which both the environment and mammalian distributions explain the favourable areas for Ebola virus in the wild.5. We demonstrate that mammalian biogeography contributes to explaining the distribution of Ebola virus in Africa, although vegetation may also underscore clear limits to the presence of the virus. Our model suggests that the Ebola virus may be even more widespread than previously suspected, given that additional favourable areas are found throughout the coastal areas of West and Central Africa, stretching from Cameroon to Guinea, and extend further East into the East African Lakes region.6. Our findings show that the most favourable area for the Ebola virus is significantly associated with the presence of the virus in non-human mammals. Core areas are surrounded by regions of intermediate favourability, in which human infections of unknown source were found. The difference in association between humans and other mammals and the virus may offer further insights on how EVD can spread.\"'], ['LACK OF CAVE-ASSOCIATED MAMMALS INFLUENCES THE FUNGAL ASSEMBLAGES OF INSULAR SOLUTION CAVES IN EASTERN CANADA,\"By: Vanderwolf, Karen J.; Malloch, David; Ivanova, Natalia V.; et al.\",JOURNAL OF CAVE AND KARST STUDIES  Volume: 78   Issue: 3   Pages: 198-207   Published: DEC 2016,\"The biogeography of cave fungi and factors that influence community composition are poorly known. The movement of animals into caves from the outside environment is thought to be one factor that affects cave mycota. Islands often have different faunal assemblages from the mainland, and this may affect the fungal diversity of island caves. In 2014 we swabbed walls in three natural solution caves on Anticosti Island, Quebec, to determine the composition of cave fungal assemblages present relative to well-studied nearby mainland sites. At least one of these caves, Grotte a la Patate in Anticosti National Park, appears to support overwintering bats. Culture-dependent methods were used to establish pure cultures, and fungi were identified by a combination of morphology and genetic sequencing. A total of 54 fungal taxa were identified, with a mean of 7.4 +/- 3.9 taxa per swab. The most common taxa isolated were Penicillium spp., Pseudogymnoascus pannorum sensu lato, P. roseus, Trichoderma sp., Cladosporium spp., Thysanophora spp., Mucor sp., and Trichosporon dulcitum. Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), the causative agent of the fungal disease white-nose syndrome in bats, was not detected, and we conclude that Pd was not present in the three sampled caves as of summer 2014. Two of the caves did not appear to be suitable bat hibernacula based on microclimate, although diverse fungal assemblages were detected on the walls. Several other fungal taxa common to bat hibernacula on the mainland, in addition to Pd, were lacking from Anticosti Island caves. We suggest that fungal assemblages on Anticosti Island are influenced by the absence of non-volant cave-visiting mammals on the island, particularly porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) and raccoons (Procyon lotor), both frequent cave associates elsewhere in Maritime Canada.\"'], ['Lineage-specific serology confirms Brazilian Atlantic forest lion tamarins, Leontopithecus chrysomelas and Leontopithecus rosalia, as reservoir hosts of Trypanosoma cruzi II (TcII),\"By: Kerr, Charlotte L.; Bhattacharyya, Tapan; Xavier, Samanta C. C.; et al.\",PARASITES & VECTORS  Volume: 9     Article Number: 584   Published: NOV 15 2016,\"Background: Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease in humans, has a vast reservoir of mammalian hosts in the Americas, and is classified into six genetic lineages, TcI-TcVI, with a possible seventh, TcBat. Elucidating enzootic cycles of the different lineages is important for understanding the ecology of this parasite, the emergence of new outbreaks of Chagas disease and for guiding control strategies. Direct lineage identification by genotyping is hampered by limitations of parasite isolation and culture. An indirect method is to identify lineage-specific serological reactions in infected individuals; here we describe its application with sylvatic Brazilian primates.Methods: Synthetic peptides representing lineage-specific epitopes of the T. cruzi surface protein TSSA were used in ELISA with sera from Atlantic Forest Leontopithecus chrysomelas (golden-headed lion tamarin), L. rosalia (golden lion tamarin), Amazonian Sapajus libidinosus (black-striped capuchin) and Alouatta belzebul (red-handed howler monkey).Results: The epitope common to lineages TcII, TcV and TcVI was recognised by sera from 15 of 26 L. chrysomelas and 8 of 13 L. rosalia. For 12 of these serologically identified TcII infections, the identity of the lineage infection was confirmed by genotyping T. cruzi isolates. Of the TcII/TcV/TcVI positive sera 12 of the 15 L. chrysomelas and 2 of the 8 L. rosalia also reacted with the specific epitope restricted to TcV and TcVI. Sera from one of six S. libidinous recognised the TcIV/TcIII epitopes.Conclusions: This lineage-specific serological surveillance has verified that Atlantic Forest primates are reservoir hosts of at least TcII, and probably TcV and TcVI, commonly associated with severe Chagas disease in the southern cone region of South America. With appropriate reagents, this novel methodology is readily applicable to a wide range of mammal species and reservoir host discovery.\"'], ['Mammals and habitat disturbance: the case of brown hare and wildfire,\"By: Sokos, Christos; Birtsas, Periklis; Papaspyropoulos, Konstantinos G.; et al.\",CURRENT ZOOLOGY  Volume: 62   Issue: 5   Pages: 421-430   Published: OCT 2016,\"Ecosystem disturbances, such as wildfires, are driving forces that determine ecology and conservation measures. Species respond differentially to wildfires, having diverse post-fire population evolution. This study reports, for first time, the responses of brown hare (Lepus europaeus Pallas, 1778) to wildfires. Hare relative abundance, age ratio, diet quality, body condition, and diseases were studied. Fire influence on vegetation was calculated at a micro-scale level. Hare abundance was lower the first year after wildfires in burned relative to unburned areas. The reverse was found in the second year when hare abundance was higher in burned areas. Hare abundance in burned areas was also higher in the third and fourth years. In the fifth and sixth years after wildfire no significant difference was found in abundance. At a micro-scale level, higher numbers of hare feces were counted in places with greater wildfire influence on vegetation. Age ratio analysis revealed more juveniles in burned areas, but the same number of neonates in burned and unburned areas, indicating lower mortality of juveniles in burned areas. Reduced predation in burned areas provides the most plausible explanation for our findings.\"'], ['Host, habitat and climate preferences of Ixodes angustus (Acari: Ixodidae) and infection with Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in California, USA,\"By: Stephenson, Nicole; Wong, Johnny; Foley, Janet\",EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY  Volume: 70   Issue: 2   Pages: 239-252   Published: OCT 2016,\"The Holarctic tick Ixodes angustus is a competent vector for Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, and possibly Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the etiologic agent of granulocytic anaplasmosis, as well. From 2005 to 2013, we collected host-feeding I. angustus individuals from live-trapped small mammals and by flagging vegetation from 12 study sites in northern and central California, and tested for B. burgdorferi sensu lato, A. phagocytophilum, and Rickettsia spp. DNA by real-time PCR. Among 261 I. angustus collected (259 from hosts and two by flagging), the most common hosts were tree squirrels (20 % of ticks) and chipmunks (37 %). The PCR-prevalence for A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi in ticks was 2 % and zero, respectively. The minimum infection prevalence on pooled DNA samples was 10 % for Rickettsia spp. DNA sequencing of the ompA gene identified this rickettsia as Candidatus Rickettsia angustus, a putative endosymbiont. A zero-inflated negative binomial mixed effects model was used to evaluate geographical and climatological predictors of I. angustus burden. When host species within study site and season within year were included in the model as nested random effects, all significant variables revealed that I. angustus burden increased as temperature decreased. Together with published data, these findings suggest that I. angustus is a host generalist, has a broad geographic distribution, is more abundant in areas with lower temperature within it\\'s range, and is rarely infected with the pathogens A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi.\"'], ['Non-systemic transmission of tick-borne diseases: A network approach,\"By: Ferreri, Luca; Bajardi, Paolo; Giacobini, Mario\",COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION  Volume: 39   Pages: 149-155   Published: OCT 2016,\"Tick-borne diseases can be transmitted via non-systemic (NS) transmission. This occurs when tick gets the infection by co-feeding with infected ticks on the same host resulting in a direct pathogen transmission between the vectors, without infecting the host. This transmission is peculiar, as it does not require any systemic infection of the host. The NS transmission is the main efficient transmission for the persistence of the tick-borne encephalitis virus in nature. By describing the heterogeneous ticks aggregation on hosts through a bipartite graphs representation, we are able to mathematically define the NS transmission and to depict the epidemiological conditions for the pathogen persistence. Despite the fact that the underlying network is largely fragmented, analytical and computational results show that the larger is the variability of the aggregation, and the easier is for the pathogen to persist in the population.

Owing to their potential correlation with fitness, several physiological parameters are commonly used to assess the effect of habitat disturbance on animals\\' general health status. Here, we studied how two lemur species, the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius) and the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), respond to changing environmental conditions by comparing their stress levels (measured as hair cortisol concentration), parasitism and general body condition across four habitats ordered along a gradient of human disturbance at Kirindy Forest, Western Madagascar. These two species previously revealed contrasting responses to human disturbance; whereas M. murinus is known as a resilient species, C. medius is rarely encountered in highly disturbed habitats. However, neither hair cortisol concentrations nor parasitism patterns (prevalence, parasite species richness and rate of multiple infections) and body condition varied across the gradient of anthropogenic disturbance. Our results indicate that the effect of anthropogenic activities at Kirindy Forest is not reflected in the general health status of both species, which may have developed a range of behavioural adaptations to deal with suboptimal conditions. Nonetheless, a difference in relative density among sites suggests that the carrying capacity of disturbed habitat is lower, and both species respond differently to environmental changes, with C. medius being more negatively affected. Thus, even for behaviourally flexible species, extended habitat deterioration could hamper long-term viability of populations.\"'], ['Decreased small mammal and on-host tick abundance in association with invasive red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta),\"By: Castellanos, Adrian A.; Medeiros, Matthew C.

Here, we examined the direct and indirect effects of the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) on the native tick, small mammal and pathogen community in southeast Texas. Using a replicated large-scale field manipulation study, we show that small mammals were more abundant on treatment plots where S. invicta populations were experimentally reduced. Our analysis of ticks on small mammal hosts demonstrated a threefold increase in the ticks caught per unit effort on treatment relative to control plots, and elevated tick loads (a 27-fold increase) on one common rodent species. We detected only one known human pathogen (Rickettsia parkeri), present in 1.4% of larvae and 6.7% of nymph on-host Amblyomma maculatum samples but with no significant difference between treatment and control plots. Given that host and vector population dynamics are key drivers of pathogen transmission, the reduced small mammal and tick abundance associated with S. invicta may alter pathogen transmission dynamics over broader spatial scales.\"'], ['Ecological Monitoring and Health Research in Luambe National Park, Zambia: Generation of Baseline Data Layers,\"By: Anderson, Neil E.; Bessell, Paul R.; Mubanga, Joseph; et al.\",ECOHEALTH  Volume: 13   Issue: 3   Pages: 511-524   Published: SEP 2016,\"Classifying, describing and understanding the natural environment is an important element of studies of human, animal and ecosystem health, and baseline ecological data are commonly lacking in remote environments of the world. Human African trypanosomiasis is an important constraint on human well-being in sub-Saharan Africa, and spillover transmission occurs from the reservoir community of wild mammals. Here we use robust and repeatable methodology to generate baseline datasets on vegetation and mammal density to investigate the ecology of warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) in the remote Luambe National Park in Zambia, in order to further our understanding of their interactions with tsetse (Glossina spp.) vectors of trypanosomiasis. Fuzzy set theory is used to produce an accurate landcover classification, and distance sampling techniques are applied to obtain species and habitat level density estimates for the most abundant wild mammals. The density of warthog burrows is also estimated and thr spatial distribution mapped. The datasets generated provide an accurate baeiseline to further ecological and epidemiological understanding of disease systems such as trypanosomiasis. This study provides a reliable framework for ecological monitoring of wild mammal densities and vegetation composition in remote, relatively inaccessible environments.\"'], ['Helminth-microparasite co-infection in wildlife: lessons from ruminants, rodents and rabbits,\"By: Ezenwa, V.

Interactions between helminths and microparasites have captured particular attention in this regard owing to the ubiquity of helminth infections in many host populations. The mechanistic underpinnings and health implications of co-infection are typically studied in laboratory and clinical settings, but recently studies of wild species have begun to tackle similar issues. Case studies from three wild mammal groupsruminants, rodents and rabbitsserve to highlight how wild studies are contributing to the broader co-infection literature. This work suggests that wildlife research can generate new and unique insights about helminth-microparasite co-infection that are fostered in part by studying parasite interactions in a natural context. For this reason, increased integration of wild studies with research in human, laboratory and veterinary animal populations can help pave the way towards a more complete understanding of the issue of co-infection.\"'], ['Do not feed the wildlife: associations between garbage use, aggression, and disease in banded mongooses (Mungos mungo),\"By: Flint, Bonnie Fairbanks; Hawley, Dana M.; Alexander, Kathleen A.\",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION  Volume: 6   Issue: 16   Pages: 5932-5939   Published: AUG 2016,\"Urbanization and other human modifications of the landscape may indirectly affect disease dynamics by altering host behavior in ways that influence pathogen transmission. Few opportunities arise to investigate behaviorally mediated effects of human habitat modification in natural host-pathogen systems, but we provide a potential example of this phenomenon in banded mongooses (Mungos mungo), a social mammal. Our banded mongoose study population in Botswana is endemically infected with a novel Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex pathogen, M. mungi, that primarily invades the mongoose host through the nasal planum and breaks in the skin. In this system, several study troops have access to human garbage sites and other modified landscapes for foraging. Banded mongooses in our study site (N = 4 troops, similar to 130 individuals) had significantly higher within-troop aggression levels when foraging in garbage compared to other foraging habitats. Second, monthly rates of aggression were a significant predictor of monthly number of injuries in troops. Finally, injured individuals had a 75% incidence of clinical tuberculosis (TB) compared to a 0% incidence in visibly uninjured mongooses during the study period. Our data suggest that mongoose troops that forage in garbage may be at greater risk of acquiring TB by incurring injuries that may allow for pathogen invasion. Our study suggests the need to consider the indirect effects of garbage on behavior and wildlife health when developing waste management approaches in human-modified areas.\"'], ['Prevalence of Gastrointestinal Parasites in Civets of Fragmented Rainforest Patches in Anamalai Hills, Western Ghats, India,\"By: Chakraborty, Debapriyo; Tiwari, Sunil; Reddy, D.

These samples were screened for the presence of gastrointestinal parasites using fecal floatation and fecal sedimentation techniques. From a total of 180 civet fecal samples, 15 gastrointestinal parasite taxa were recovered, and these species are also known to infect domesticated animals. Additionally, small, disturbed forest fragments recorded higher mean gastrointestinal parasite taxa and greater prevalence when compared to large, undisturbed forest fragments, indicating a potential relationship between anthropogenic activities and gastrointestinal parasitism of civets in the Anamalai Hills.\"'], ['The Woodrat Gut Microbiota as an Experimental System for Understanding Microbial Metabolism of Dietary Toxins,\"By: Kohl, Kevin D.; Dearing, M. Denise\",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY  Volume: 7     Article Number: 1165   Published: JUL 28 2016,\"The microbial communities inhabiting the alimentary tracts of mammals, particularly those of herbivores, are estimated to be one of the densest microbial reservoirs on Earth. The significance of these gut microbes in influencing the physiology, ecology and evolution of their hosts is only beginning to be realized. To understand the microbiome of herbivores with a focus on nutritional ecology, while evaluating the roles of host evolution and environment in sculpting microbial diversity, we have developed an experimental system consisting of the microbial communities of several species of herbivorous woodrats (genus Neotoma) that naturally feed on a variety of dietary toxins. We designed this system to investigate the long-standing, but experimentally neglected hypothesis that ingestion of toxic diets by herbivores is facilitated by the gut microbiota. Like several other rodent species, the woodrat stomach has a sacculated, non-gastric foregut portion. We have documented a dense and diverse community of microbes in the woodrat foregut, with several genera potentially capable of degrading dietary toxins and/or playing a role in stimulating hepatic detoxification enzymes of the host. The biodiversity of these gut microbes appears to be a function of host evolution, ecological experience and diet, such that dietary toxins increase microbial diversity in hosts with experience with these toxins while novel toxins depress microbial diversity. These microbial communities are critical to the ingestion of a toxic diet as reducing the microbial community with antibiotics impairs the hosts ability to feed on dietary toxins. Furthermore, the detoxification capacity of gut microbes can be transferred from Neotoma both intra and interspecifically to naive animals that lack ecological and evolutionary history with these toxins. In addition to advancing our knowledge of complex host-microbes interactions, this system holds promise for identifying microbes that could be useful in the treatment of diseases in humans and domestic animals.\"'], ['Droughts may increase susceptibility of prairie dogs to fleas: incongruity with hypothesized mechanisms of plague cycles in rodents,\"By: Eads, David A.; Biggins, Dean E.; Long, Dustin H.; et al.\",JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY  Volume: 97   Issue: 4   Pages: 1044-1053   Published: JUL 25 2016,\"Plague is a reemerging, rodent-associated zoonosis caused by the flea-borne bacterium Yersinia pestis. As a vectorborne disease, rates of plague transmission may increase when fleas are abundant. Fleas are highly susceptible to desiccation under hot-dry conditions; we posited that their densities decline during droughts. We evaluated this hypothesis with black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) in New Mexico, June-August 2010-2012. Precipitation was relatively plentiful during 2010 and 2012 but scarce during 2011, the driest spring-summer on record for the northeastern grasslands of New Mexico. Unexpectedly, fleas were 200% more abundant in 2011 than in 2010 and 2012. Prairie dogs were in 27% better condition during 2010 and 2012, and they devoted 287% more time to grooming in 2012 than in 2011. During 2012, prairie dogs provided with supplemental food and water were in 23% better condition and carried 40% fewer fleas. Collectively, these results suggest that during dry years, prairie dogs are limited by food and water, and they exhibit weakened defenses against fleas. Long-term data are needed to evaluate the generality of whether droughts increase flea densities and how changes in flea abundance during sequences of dry and wet years might affect plague cycles in mammalian hosts.\"'], ['Parapoxviruses, little-known zoonotic pathogens,\"By: Bessaud, Mael; Ferraris, Olivier; Ferrier-Rembert, Audrey; et al.\",VIROLOGIE  Volume: 20   Issue: 4   Pages: 218-230   Published: JUL-AUG 2016,\"Parapoxviruses, double-stranded DNA viruses of the Poxviridae family, are etiologic agents of cutaneaous infectious diseases among farm animals. These highly contagious viruses are responsible for wide outbreaks among livestock. The clinical manifestations are generally mild and consist of cutaneous or mucosal lesions, which resolve spontaneously within a few weeks. However, secondary bacterial or fungal infections on the lesion sites can aggravate the symptoms. Sore lesions located within the oral cavity and on the udders can impair feeding or nursing, thus leading to death. Livestock parapoxviruses can infect humans by direct or indirect transmission and affect mainly farmers, slaughters and veterinarians. Human symptoms generally consist of small cutaneous lesions located at the inoculation points but more severe forms can occur, peculiarly in immunocompromised persons. The parapoxvirus epidemiology is poorly understood: their respective host range and ecology among wild animals are to be clarified. The identification of parapoxviruses among marine mammals suggests that the genetic diversity within the genus is still underestimated.\"'], ['A new taxonomic toolkit for identification of two sympatric species of Bandicota (Rodentia: Muridae) from mainland Southeast Asia,\"By: Chaval, Yannick; Waengsothorn, Surachit; Morand, Serge; et al.\",MAMMALIA  Volume: 80   Issue: 4   Pages: 425-439   Published: JUL 2016,\"Bandicoot rats are a widespread species in Asia. Throughout their distribution, bandicoot rats are of high sanitary importance as reservoirs of at least 10 human diseases. In mainland Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, where two species coexist, taxonomic distinction based on external characters is difficult and may lead to a certain proportion of misidentification. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency of classical methods for distinguishing these bandicoot species, and provide new, simple, and cheap tools for discriminating species based on molecular characteristics, morphological ratio, and morphometric variation. Two PCR tests were developed: a first (PCR1) for distinguishing Bandicota and Rattus genera, and a second (PCR2) for distinguishing Bandicota indica and Bandicota savilei species. We evaluated two morphometric approaches for species discrimination: (a) one based on the ratio between head and body and hind-foot length, and (b) a second based on landmark analysis of mandible forms. The accuracy of both morphological approaches was fairly high. Together, the three identification tools appear useful for a wide scientific community, including curators, agronomists, ecologists, and epidemiologists wishing to have access to reliable species identification.\"'], ['Host-feeding patterns of mosquito species in Germany,\"By: Boerstler, Jessica; Joest, Hanna; Garms, Rolf; et al.\",PARASITES & VECTORS  Volume: 9     Article Number: 318   Published: JUN 3 2016,\"Background: Mosquito-borne pathogens are of growing importance in many countries of Europe including Germany. At the same time, the transmission cycles of most mosquito-borne pathogens (e.g. viruses or filarial parasites) are not completely understood. There is especially a lack of knowledge about the vector capacity of the different mosquito species, which is strongly influenced by their host-feeding patterns. While this kind of information is important to identify the relevant vector species, e.g. to direct efficient control measures, studies about the host-feeding patterns of mosquito species in Germany are scarce and outdated.Methods: Between 2012 and 2015, 775 blood-fed mosquito specimens were collected. Sampling was conducted with Heavy Duty Encephalitis Vector Survey traps, Biogents Sentinel traps, gravid traps, hand-held aspirators, sweep nets, and human-bait collection. The host species for each mosquito specimen was identified with polymerase chain reactions and subsequent Sanger sequencing of the cytochrome b gene.Results: A total of 32 host species were identified for 23 mosquito species, covering 21 mammalian species (including humans) and eleven bird species. Three mosquito species accounted for nearly three quarters of all collected blood-fed mosquitoes: Aedes vexans (363 specimens, 46.8 % of all mosquito specimens), Culex pipiens pipiens form pipiens (100, 12.9 %) and Ochlerotatus cantans (99, 12.8 %). Non-human mammals dominated the host species (572 specimens, 73.8 % of all mosquito specimens), followed by humans (152, 19.6 %) and birds (51, 6.6 %). The most common host species were roe deer (Capreolus capreolus; 258 mosquito specimens, 33.3 % of all mosquito specimens, 65 % of all mosquito species), humans (Homo sapiens; 152, 19.6 %, 90 %), cattle (Bos taurus; 101, 13.0 %, 60 %), and wild boar (Sus scrofa; 116, 15.0 %, 50 %). There were no statistically significant differences in the spatial-temporal host-feeding patterns of the three most common mosquito species.Conclusions: Although the collected blood-fed mosquito species had a strong overlap of host species, two different host-feeding groups were identified with mosquito species feeding on (i) non-human mammals and humans or (ii) birds, non-human mammals, and humans, which make them potential vectors of pathogens only between mammals or between mammals and birds, respectively. Due to the combination of their host-feeding patterns and wide distribution in Germany, Cx. pipiens pipiens form pipiens and Cx. torrentium are potentially most important vectors for pathogens transmitted from birds to humans and the species Ae. vexans for pathogens transmitted from non-human mammals to humans. Finally, the presented study indicated a much broader host range compared to the classifications found in the literature for some of the species, which highlights the need for studies on the host-feeding patterns of mosquitoes to further assess their vector capacity and the disease ecology in Europe.\"'], ['Environmental Variables Associated with Hantavirus Reservoirs and Other Small Rodent Species in Two National Parks in the Parana Delta, Argentina: Implications for Disease Prevention,\"By: Victoria Vadell, Maria; Gomez Villafane, Isabel Elisa\",ECOHEALTH  Volume: 13   Issue: 2   Pages: 248-260   Published: JUN 2016,\"Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a severe zoonotic disease caused by hantaviruses hosted in various rodents species. In Argentina, its transmission to humans has been associated to exposure during activities such as farming, recreation, and tourism which are carried out in wild and rural areas. The aim of this study was to analyze the macro- and micro-habitat use and spatio-temporal variation of small sylvan rodents in Pre Delta and Islas de Santa Fe national parks, located in an HPS-endemic area of Argentina. Rodent communities were studied at six sites: two islands, a riparian forest, an inland forest, a marsh, and the margins of a pond. A total of 453 individuals of five species were captured with a trapping effort of 9471 trap-nights. Maximum species richness was found at the marsh and the pond margin sites. Abundance of rodents was influenced by flooding events. Two hantavirus reservoirs, Oligoryzomys flavescens and Akodon azarae, were identified in the area. O. flavescens was captured in every habitat, but it was dominant in Islas de Santa Fe National Park where its abundance was strongly influenced by flooding. A. azarae was captured in every habitat except on the islands. A. azarae behaved as a generalist species at a micro-habitat scale in every habitat of Pre Delta National Park except for the marsh where it selected patches with low vegetation height. Based on these results, several disease prevention measures, including the use of rodent-proof containers for food, and keeping the grass short in the camp site, are proposed in order to reduce the risk to visitors and residents of contracting HPS.\"'], ['A comparative assessment of track plates to quantify fine scale variations in the relative abundance of Norway rats in urban slums,\"By: Hacker, Kathryn P.; Minter, Amanda; Begon, Mike; et al.\",URBAN ECOSYSTEMS  Volume: 19   Issue: 2   Pages: 561-575   Published: JUN 2016,\"Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) living in urban environments are a critical public health and economic problem, particularly in urban slums where residents are at a higher risk for rat borne diseases, yet convenient methods to quantitatively assess population sizes are lacking. We evaluated track plates as a method to determine rat distribution and relative abundance in a complex urban slum environment by correlating the presence and intensity of rat-specific marks on track plates with findings from rat infestation surveys and trapping of rats to population exhaustion. To integrate the zero-inflated track plate data we developed a two-component mixture model with one binary and one censored continuous component. Track plate mark-intensity was highly correlated with signs of rodent infestation (all coefficients between 0.61 and 0.79 and all p-values  0.05). Moreover, the mean level of pre-trapping rat-mark intensity on plates was significantly associated with the number of rats captured subsequently (Odds ratio1.38; 95 % CI 1.19-1.61) and declined significantly following trapping (Odds ratio 0.86; 95 % CI 0.78-0.95). Track plates provided robust proxy measurements of rat abundance and distribution and detected rat presence even when populations appeared \\'trapped out\\'. Tracking plates are relatively easy and inexpensive methods that can be used to intensively sample settings such as urban slums, where traditional trapping or mark-recapture studies are impossible to implement, and therefore the results can inform and assess the impact of targeted urban rodent control campaigns.\"'], ['TROPHIC ECOLOGY OF TWO RAPTORS, BARN OWL (TYTO ALBA) AND WHITE-TAILED KITE (ELANUS LEUCURUS), AND POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS FOR BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF HANTAVIRUS RESERVOIR IN CHILE,\"By: Munoz-Pedreros, Andres; Gil, Claudia; Yanez, Jose; et al.\",WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY  Volume: 128   Issue: 2   Pages: 391-403   Published: JUN 2016,\"Raptors are important predators of various species of small mammals, which renders them of economic importance since their prey may be either disease vectors or reservoirs which represent health problems, or economically important through the damage they cause to crops and stocks. The long-tailed rice rat Oligoryzomys longicaudatus is a reservoir and vector of Hantavirus, a disease of increasing importance in various Latin American countries. The nocturnal Barn Owl (Tyto alba) and the diurnal White-tailed Kite (Elanus leucurus) appear to be the most significant predators of this species. Here, we characterize the diet of these two raptors and analyze their trophic specialization and dietary selectivity using published information, pellet analysis, and field abundances of small mammals. Both raptor species positively selected O. longicaudatus in their diets to suggest that they could be potential controllers of the Hantavirus reservoir in Chile, both in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Predation on O. longicaudatus by these two raptors is interesting because they have complementary activity periods, a condition which enables them to share the same prey without having strong interference.\"'], ['Regional variation of the manifestation, prevalence, and severity of giraffe skin disease: A review of an emerging disease in wild and captive giraffe populations,\"By: Muneza, Arthur B.; Montgomery, Robert A.; Fennessy, Julian T.; et al.\",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION  Volume: 198   Pages: 145-156   Published: JUN 2016,\"Large mammals have drastically declined in the past few decades yet we know little about their ecology. Giraffe numbers for instance, have dropped by more than 40% in the last 15 years and recently, a skin disease,,has been observed in numerous giraffe populations across Africa. The disease(s), commonly referred to as giraffe skin disease (GSD), manifests as lesions, wrinkled skin, and encrustations that can affect the limbs, shoulder or neck of giraffes. Here, we review GSD cases from literature reports and surveying efforts of individuals working with giraffes in the wild and in captivity. The aim of this review was to describe spatial variation in the anatomical location of lesions, prevalence, and severity of GSD. In total, we retrieved 16 published sources that referenced GSD and we received 63 respondents to our survey. We found that GSD has been observed in 13 protected areas across 7 countries in Africa and in 11 out of 48 zoos distributed across 6 countries. The prevalence of GSD in wild populations ranged from 2% to 80% of observed giraffes. Although little research to date has focused on GSD, our review reveals that the disease is more prevalent than initially thought and more severe in some areas than previously assumed. With vast areas of Sub-Saharan Africa still without information on GSD, researching the prevalence and conservation impacts of this disease should be a priority. We propose broader and longer-term studies to further describe and comprehend the effects of GSD on giraffe vital rates among populations in the wild and in captivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Of the 22 vulture species, nine are critically endangered, three are endangered, four are near threatened, and six are least concern. Meanwhile, the vast majority of avian facultative scavenger species, such as corvids and gulls, have stable or increasing populations. We analyze the causes of this stark contrast in status and evaluate what ecological factors contribute to extinction risk for all 106 avian scavenger species. A random forest model shows that diet breadth, proportion scavenged diet, geographic realm, body mass, clutch size and taxonomy are leading predictors of extinction risk. Meanwhile, dietary toxins - most notably poisons and the veterinary drug diclofenac - are by far the most important anthropogenic threat to avian scavengers, comprising the leading cause of decline for 59% of threatened avian scavenger species and 88% of threatened vulture species. Currently, 73% of vulture species are extinction-prone (near threatened, vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered and extinct) and 77% have declining populations, while only 13% of avian facultative scavenger species are extinction-prone and 70% have stable or increasing populations. As vultures decline, populations of many facultative scavengers are growing, causing trophic cascades from increased predation, competition, and invasion. Furthermore, vultures\\' highly specialized digestive systems efficiently eradicate diseases when consuming carrion, whereas facultative scavengers are more susceptible to contract and transmit diseases among themselves and to humans. We urge immediate action, particularly by regulating lethal dietary toxins, to prevent the extinction of vultures and loss of respective ecosystem services. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To better understand the composition of gut microbiota in marine mammals, fecal bacterial communities of the Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea), an endangered pinniped with localized distribution, were examined. A comparison of samples from individuals across 11 wild colonies in South and Western Australia and three Australian captive populations showed five dominant bacterial phyla: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria. The phylum Firmicutes was dominant in both wild (76.4% +/- 4.73%) and captive animals (61.4% +/- 10.8%), while Proteobacteria contributed more to captive (29.3% +/- 11.5%) than to wild (10.6% +/- 3.43%) fecal communities. Qualitative differences were observed between fecal communities from wild and captive animals based on principal-coordinate analysis. SIMPER (similarity percentage procedure) analyses indicated that operational taxonomic units (OTU) from the bacterial families Clostridiaceae and Ruminococcaceae were more abundant in wild than in captive animals and contributed most to the average dissimilarity between groups (SIMPER contributions of 19.1% and 10.9%, respectively). Differences in the biological environment, the foraging site fidelity, and anthropogenic impacts may provide various opportunities for unique microbial establishment in Australian sea lions. As anthropogenic disturbances to marine mammals are likely to increase, understanding the potential for such disturbances to impact microbial community compositions and subsequently affect animal health will be beneficial for management of these vulnerable species.IMPORTANCEThe Australian sea lion is an endangered species for which there is currently little information regarding disease and microbial ecology. In this work, we present an in-depth study of the fecal microbiota of a large number of Australian sea lions from geographically diverse wild and captive populations. Colony location and captivity were found to influence the gut microbial community compositions of these animals. Our findings significantly extend the baseline knowledge of marine mammal gut microbiome composition and variability.\"'], ['Selective predation on hantavirus-infected voles by owls and confounding effects from landscape properties,\"By: Khalil, Hussein; Ecke, Frauke; Evander, Magnus; et al.\",OECOLOGIA  Volume: 181   Issue: 2   Pages: 597-606   Published: JUN 2016,\"It has been suggested that predators may protect human health through reducing disease-host densities or selectively preying on infected individuals from the population. However, this has not been tested empirically. We hypothesized that Tengmalm\\'s owl (Aegolius funereus) selectively preys on hantavirus-infected individuals of its staple prey, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Bank voles are hosts of Puumala hantavirus, which causes a form of hemorrhagic fever in humans. Selective predation by owls on infected voles may reduce human disease risk. We compared the prevalence of anti-Puumala hantavirus antibodies (seroprevalence), in bank voles cached by owls in nest boxes to seroprevalence in voles trapped in closed-canopy forest around each nest box. We found no general difference in seroprevalence. Forest landscape structure could partly account for the observed patterns in seroprevalence. Only in more connected forest patches was seroprevalence in bank voles cached in nest boxes higher than seroprevalence in trapped voles. This effect disappeared with increasing forest patch isolation, as seroprevalence in trapped voles increased with forest patch isolation, but did not in cached voles. Our results suggest a complex relationship between zoonotic disease prevalence in hosts, their predators, and landscape structure. Some mechanisms that may have caused the seroprevalence patterns in our results include higher bank vole density in isolated forest patches. This study offers future research potential to shed further light on the contribution of predators and landscape properties to human health.\"'], ['Differences in the ectoparasite fauna between micromammals captured in natural and adjacent residential areas are better explained by sex and season than by type of habitat,\"By: Cevidanes, Aitor; Proboste, Tatiana; Chirife, Andrea D.; et al.\",PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH  Volume: 115   Issue: 6   Pages: 2203-2211   Published: JUN 2016,\"We compared the ectoparasite fauna in 608 micromammals (chiefly 472 wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus, 63 Algerian mice Mus spretus, and 51 greater white-toothed shrews Crocidura russula) captured in natural and adjacent residential areas in spring and autumn during three consecutive years in four areas in periurban Barcelona (NE Spain). We found little support for an association of urbanization with differences in infestation by ectoparasites. Prevalence of Rhipicephalus sp. tick in wood mice and shrews was significantly higher in residential than in natural habitats, and the opposite was found for the flea Ctenophtalmus andorrensis catalanensis in shrews. Marked differences in the prevalence of the flea Leptopsylla taschenbergi amitina in wood mice between seasons were observed in natural but not in residential habitats, probably due to enhanced flea survival probabilities in the latter. However, as a rule, males were more frequently and heavily infested than females, and the prevalence was higher in autumn than in spring. Our results suggest that the ectoparasite fauna of periurban micromammals is shaped more by other factors than by habitat modification. People living in residential areas are at risk of contact with the arthropods borne by non-commensal micromammals and the pathogens transmitted by them.\"'], ['Molecular Ecological Insights into Neotropical Bird-Tick Interactions,\"By: Miller, Matthew J.; Esser, Helen J.; Loaiza, Jose R.; et al.\",PLOS ONE  Volume: 11   Issue: 5     Article Number: e0155989   Published: MAY 20 2016,\"In the tropics, ticks parasitize many classes of vertebrate hosts. However, because many tropical tick species are only identifiable in the adult stage, and these adults usually parasitize mammals, most attention on the ecology of tick-host interactions has focused on mammalian hosts. In contrast, immature Neotropical ticks are often found on wild birds, yet difficulties in identifying immatures hinder studies of birds\\' role in tropical tick ecology and tick-borne disease transmission. In Panama, we found immature ticks on 227 out of 3,498 individually-sampled birds representing 93 host species (24% of the bird species sampled, and 13% of the Panamanian land bird fauna). Tick parasitism rates did not vary with rainfall or temperature, but did vary significantly with several host ecological traits. Likewise, Neotropical-Nearctic migratory birds were significantly less likely to be infested than resident species. Using a molecular library developed from morphologically-identified adult ticks specifically for this study, we identified eleven tick species parasitizing birds, indicating that a substantial portion of the Panamanian avian species pool is parasitized by a diversity of tick species. Tick species that most commonly parasitized birds had the widest diversity of avian hosts, suggesting that immature tick species are opportunistic bird parasites. Although certain avian ecological traits are positively associated with parasitism, we found no evidence that individual tick species show specificity to particular avian host ecological traits. Finally, our data suggest that the four principal vectors of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in the Neotropics rarely, if ever, parasitize Panamanian birds. However, other tick species that harbor newly-discovered rickettsial parasites of unknown pathogenicity are frequently found on these birds. Given our discovery of broad interaction between Panamanian tick and avian biodiversity, future work on tick ecology and the dynamics of emerging tropical tick-borne pathogens should explicitly consider wild bird as hosts.\"'], ['Occurrence and Intensity of Anisakid Nematode Larvae in Some Commercially Important Fish Species in Persian Gulf,\"By: Dadar, Maryam; Alborzi, Alireza; Peyghan, Rahim; et al.\",IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY  Volume: 11   Issue: 2   Pages: 239-246   Published: APR-JUN 2016,\"Background: Anisakid nematodes are common parasites of fish, mammals, fish-eating birds, and reptiles with a worldwide distribution, causing diseases in human, fish and important economic losses.Methods: A preliminary epidemiological study was carried out on Anisakid nematodes larvae in some commercially important fish species to evaluate the anisakid nematode larvae from greater lizardfish, (Saurida tumbil), Japanese thread fin bream (Nemipterus japonicus), crocodile longtom (Tylosurus crocodilus crocodiles) and longfin trevally (Carangoides armatus) from the Persian Gulf of Iran.Result: The collected larvae were identified mainly as the third larval stage (L3) of Hysterothylacium larval type A, B and C, Anisakis sp., Raphidascaris sp., Pseudoterranova sp. and Philometra sp.

Despite the importance of this zoonosis for human health, the evolutionary and ecological drivers shaping bacterial communities in host reservoirs remain poorly investigated. Here, we describe Leptospira communities hosted by Malagasy bats, composed of mostly endemic species, in order to characterize host-pathogen associations and investigate their evolutionary histories. We screened 947 individual bats (representing 31 species, 18 genera and seven families) for Leptospira infection and subsequently genotyped positive samples using three different bacterial loci. Molecular identification showed that these Leptospira are notably diverse and include several distinct lineages mostly belonging to Leptospira borgpetersenii and L. kirschneri. The exploration of the most probable host-pathogen evolutionary scenarios suggests that bacterial genetic diversity results from a combination of events related to the ecology and the evolutionary history of their hosts. Importantly, based on the data set presented herein, the notable host-specificity we have uncovered, together with a lack of geographical structuration of bacterial genetic diversity, indicates that the Leptospira community at a given site depends on the co-occurring bat species assemblage. The implications of such tight host-specificity on the epidemiology of leptospirosis are discussed.\"'], ['Epidemiology of Emergent Madariaga Encephalitis in a Region with Endemic Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis: Initial Host Studies and Human Cross-Sectional Study in Darien, Panama,\"By: Vittor, Amy Y.; Armien, Blas; Gonzalez, Publio; et al.\",PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES  Volume: 10   Issue: 4     Article Number: e0004554   Published: APR 2016,\"BackgroundNeurotropic arboviral infections are an important cause of encephalitis. A zoonotic, vector-borne alphavirus, Madariaga virus (MADV; formerly known as South American eastern equine encephalitis virus), caused its first documented human outbreak in 2010 in Darien, Panama, where the genetically similar Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is endemic. We report the results of a seroprevalence survey of animals and humans, illustrating contrasting features of MADV and VEEV ecology and epidemiology.MethodsSmall mammals were trapped in 42 sites in Darien, Panama, using Sherman traps, Tomahawk traps, and mist nets for bats. Blood was tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to MADV and VEEV. In addition, bird sera collected in 2007 in Chagres, Panama, were tested for MADV and VEEV neutralizing antibodies. Viremia was ascertained by RTPCR. Human exposure to these two viruses was determined by IgG ELISA, followed by plaque reduction neutralization tests. To identify relevant risk factors for MADV or VEEV exposure, logistic regression analysis was performed, and the most parsimonious model was selected based on the Akaike information criterion.ResultsThe animal survey yielded 32 bats (16 species), 556 rodents (12 species), and 20 opossums (4 species). The short-tailed cane mouse (Zygodontomys brevicauda) found abundantly in pasture and farms, had the highest MADV seroprevalence (8.3%). For VEEV, the shrub and forest-dwelling long-whiskered rice rat (Transandinomys bolivaris) had the highest seroprevalence (19.0%). Viremia was detected in one animal (Z. brevicauda). Of the 159 bird sera (50 species) tested, none were positive for either virus. In humans (n = 770), neutralizing antibodies to MADV and VEEV were present in 4.8% and 31.5%, respectively. MADV seropositivity was positively associated with cattle ranching, farming, and fishing. Having VEEV antibodies and shrubs near the house diminished risk. Age, forest work, farming and fishing were risk factors for VEEV, while having MADV antibodies, glazed windows, waste pick-up and piped water were protective.ConclusionOur findings suggest that the short-tailed cane mouse and the long-whiskered rice rat serve as hosts for MADV and VEEV, respectively. The preferred habitat of these rodent species coincides with areas associated with human infection risk. Our findings also indicate that MADV emerged recently in humans, and that the transmission cycles of these two sympatric alphaviruses differ spatially and in host utilization.\"'], ['A bibliometric analysis to illustrate the role of an embedded research capability in South African National Parks,\"By: van Wilgen, Brian W.; Boshoff, Nelius; Smit, Izak P.

The authorship of 1026 papers was highly collaborative, with the majority of papers (70 %) being contributed by external researchers. Research was concentrated in five of the 19 parks, and was biased towards animal and ecological process studies in savanna ecosystems. Researchers have mainly worked in older, larger, and arguably more aesthetically-appealing parks that are either close to hand or that provide subsidized accommodation to researchers, and that have established experimental setups or useful long-term data; smaller and more remote parks have received less research attention. Certain priority topics for management, such as degradation of freshwater ecosystems, global change, marine ecology, and socio-ecological dynamics have not received much attention, and are areas identified for growth. Embedded authors were found to be more highly connected and influential than external researchers, leveraging and connecting many research projects.

A criticism of the dilution effect is that increasing host species richness might amplify disease risk, assuming that total host abundance, and therefore feeding opportunities for ticks, increase with species richness. In contrast, a dilution effect is expected when poor quality hosts for ticks and pathogens (dilution hosts) divert tick blood meals away from competent hosts. Even if host densities are additive, the relationship between host density and tick encounters can be nonlinear if the number of ticks that encounter a host is a saturating function of host density, which occurs if ticks aggregate on the remaining hosts rather than failing to find a host before death. Both dilution and amplification are theoretical possibilities, and assessing which is more prevalent required detailed analyses of empirical systems. We used field data to explore the degree of tick redistribution onto fewer individuals with variation in intraspecific host density and novel data-driven models for tick dynamics to determine how changes in vertebrate community composition influence the density of nymphs infected with the Lyme bacterium. To be conservative, we allowed total host density to increase additively with species richness. Our long-term field studies found that larval and nymphal ticks redistribute onto fewer individuals as host densities decline, that a large proportion of nymphs and adults find hosts, and that mice and chipmunks feed a large proportion of nymphs. White-footed mice, eastern chipmunks, short-tailed shrews, and masked shrews were important amplification hosts that greatly increased the density of infected nymphs. Gray squirrels and Virginia opossums were important dilution hosts. Removing these two species increased the maximum number of larvae attached to amplification hosts by 57%. Raccoons and birds were minor dilution hosts under some conditions. Even under the assumption of additive community assembly, some species are likely to reduce the density of infected nymphs as diversity increases. If the assumption of additivity is relaxed, then species that reduce the density of small mammals through predation or competition might substantially reduce disease risk.\"'], ['The Bacteriome of Bat Flies (Nycteribiidae) from the Malagasy Region: a Community Shaped by Host Ecology, Bacterial Transmission Mode, and Host-Vector Specificity,\"By: Wilkinson, David A.; Duron, Olivier; Cordonin, Colette; et al.\",APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY  Volume: 82   Issue: 6   Pages: 1778-1788   Published: MAR 2016,\"The Nycteribiidae are obligate blood-sucking Diptera (Hippoboscoidea) flies that parasitize bats. Depending on species, these wingless flies exhibit either high specialism or generalism toward their hosts, which may in turn have important consequences in terms of their associated microbial community structure. Bats have been hypothesized to be reservoirs of numerous infectious agents, some of which have recently emerged in human populations. Thus, bat flies may be important in the epidemiology and transmission of some of these bat-borne infectious diseases, acting either directly as arthropod vectors or indirectly by shaping pathogen communities among bat populations. In addition, bat flies commonly have associations with heritable bacterial endo-symbionts that inhabit insect cells and depend on maternal transmission through egg cytoplasm to ensure their transmission. Some of these heritable bacteria are likely obligate mutualists required to support bat fly development, but others are facultative symbionts with unknown effects. Here, we present bacterial community profiles that were obtained from seven bat fly species, representing five genera, parasitizing bats from the Malagasy region. The observed bacterial diversity includes Rickettsia, Wolbachia, and several Arsenophonus-like organisms, as well as other members of the Enterobacteriales and a widespread association of Bartonella bacteria from bat flies of all five genera. Using the well-described host specificity of these flies and data on community structure from selected bacterial taxa with either vertical or horizontal transmission, we show that host/vector specificity and transmission mode are important drivers of bacterial community structure.\"'], ['Climate-driven range shifts are stochastic processes at a local level: two flying squirrel species in Maine,\"By: Wood, Connor M.; Witham, Jack W.; Hunter, Malcolm L., Jr.\",ECOSPHERE  Volume: 7   Issue: 2     Article Number: e01240   Published: FEB 2016,\"Numerous directional range shifts have been linked to climate change, but mechanistic explanations are frequently absent. In North America, southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) range has expanded northward as a result of climate change, and northern flying squirrel (G. sabrinus) range has shifted north, likely in response to competition. We tracked both species abundances as well as climate, food availability, and forest structure over 31 yr, and found complete species turnover from G. sabrinus to G. volans in 18 yr. We tested multiple generalized least squares models of each species\\' abundance over time. The top model for G. sabrinus indicated that abundance was likely shaped by the arrival of G. volans, a competitor and known vector of a pathological nematode, food, and modest anthropogenic changes to forest structure; the top model for G. volans suggested that warm winters coinciding with high mast years likely facilitated the initial establishment of G. volans, whereas positive density dependence likely shaped subsequent population dynamics. The only significant change to local climate was an increase in minimum summer temperature, which would enhance the survival of Strongyloides robustus, the nematode carried by G. volans and detrimental to G. sabrinus. This complex suite of interactions suggests that at a local level, range shifts may be a largely stochastic process permitted by the temporal coincidence of multiple species-and site-specific factors.\"'], ['Endoparasite survey of free-swimming baleen whales (Balaenoptera musculus, B. physalus, B. borealis) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) using non/minimally invasive methods,\"By: Hermosilla, Carlos; Silva, Liliana M.

In total, 17 individual whale fecal samples [n=10 (B. physalus); n=4 (P. macrocephalus); n=2 (B. musculus); n=1 (B. borealis)] were collected from free-swimming animals as part of ongoing studies on behavioral ecology. Furthermore, skin biopsies were collected from sperm whales (n=5) using minimally invasive biopsy darting and tested for the presence of Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, and Besnoitia besnoiti DNA via PCR. Overall, more than ten taxa were detected in whale fecal samples. Within protozoan parasites, Entamoeba spp. occurred most frequently (64.7 %), followed by Giardia spp. (17.6 %) and Balantidium spp. (5.9 %). The most prevalent metazoan parasites were Ascaridida indet. spp. (41.2 %), followed by trematodes (17.7 %), acanthocephalan spp., strongyles (11.8 %), Diphyllobotrium spp. (5.9 %), and spirurids (5.9 %). Helminths were mainly found in sperm whales, while enteric protozoan parasites were exclusively detected in baleen whales, which might be related to dietary differences. No T. gondii, N. caninum, or B. besnoiti DNA was detected in any skin sample.

Phylogenetic analyses of ITS1/2 + 5.8s sequences split Sporothrix genus in two well-defined groups with dissimilar ecologies. Species embedded in the Sporothrix schenckii complex are frequently agents of human and animal sporotrichosis, and some of these are responsible for large sapronoses and zoonoses around the warmer temperate regions of the world. At the other extreme, basal saprophytic species evolved in association with decaying wood and soil, and are rarely found to cause human disease. We propose to create a new taxa, Sporothrix chilensis sp. nov., to accommodate strains collected from a clinical case of onychomycosis as well as from environmental origins in Chile. Multigene analyses based on ITS1/2 + 5.8s region, beta-tubulin, calmodulin and translation elongation factor 1 alpha revealed that S. chilensis is a member of the Sporothrix pallida complex, and the nearest taxon is Sporothrix mexicana, a rare soil-borne species, non-pathogenic to humans. The ITS region serves as a primary barcode marker, while each one of the protein-coding loci easily recognized species boundaries providing sufficient information for species identification. A disseminated model of murine sporotrichosis revealed a mild-pathogenic potential, with lung invasion. Although S. chilensis is not a primary pathogen, accidental infection may have an impact in the immunosuppressed population. With the introduction of distinct species with similar routes of transmission but different virulence, identification of Sporothrix agents at the species level is mandatory.

This is particularly true for vector-borne diseases which depend on abiotic (e.g. climate) and biotic conditions (i.e. hosts and vectors). In this study, we investigated how landscape features affect the abundances of small mammals and Ixodes ricinus ticks, and how they influence their relationship.Methods: From 2012 to 2014, small mammals and questing I. ricinus ticks were sampled in spring and autumn in 24 sites located in agricultural and forest landscapes in Brittany, France. We tested the effects of landscape features (composition and configuration) on the abundances of small mammal species and immature ticks and their relationship. Additionally, we quantified the larval tick burden of small mammals in 2012 to better describe this relationship.Results: The nymph abundance was positively influenced by the larval occurrence and the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus abundance the previous spring because they hosted tenfold more larvae than the bank vole Myodes glareolus. The bank vole abundance in spring and autumn had a negative and positive effect, respectively, on the nymph abundance. In agricultural landscapes, wood mice were positively influenced by woodland cover and woodland/hedgerow-grassland ecotone, whereas bank voles showed the opposite or non-significant responses to these landscape variables. The woodland cover had a positive effect on immature ticks.Conclusion: The landscape configuration, likely by affecting the landscape connectivity, influences the small mammal communities in permanent habitats. Our study showed that the wood mouse, due to its dominance and to its tolerance to ticks, feeds a substantial proportion of larvae. The acquired resistance to ticks in the bank vole can reduce its role as a trophic resource over time. The nymph abundance seems indirectly influenced by landscape features via their effects on the small mammal community. To enhance our understanding of the epidemiology of tick-borne diseases within landscapes, further studies will integrate data on pathogen prevalence and investigate explicitly the effect of landscape connectivity on host-vector-pathogen systems.\"'], ['Sympathy for the devil: captive-management style did not influence survival, body-mass change or diet of Tasmanian devils 1 year after wild release,\"By: Rogers, Tracey; Fox, Samantha; Pemberton, David; et al.\",WILDLIFE RESEARCH  Volume: 43   Issue: 7   Pages: 544-552   Published: 2016,\"Context. The value of captive breeding for recovery programs of endangered carnivorous mammals is often questioned because of low post-release survival reported for founder animals following translocation.Aims. The aim of the present study was to test the effect of rearing method on survival and body mass of captive-raised Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) following release on an offshore island. We also compared the post-release diet of these devils with the diet of wild devils on mainland Tasmania, where a similar array of diet items is available.Methods. Twenty-eight captive-raised devils were released onto the island; 19 had been raised in intensive captive-management facilities (IC) and nine in free-range (22 ha) enclosures (FRE). Survival and body-mass change were compared between IC and FRE for up to 440 days post-release. Devil diet was assessed via scat analysis.Key results. A high proportion (96%) of the founders survived 1 year post-release. Pre-release captive-rearing method had no effect. Released devils gained an average of 14% of their original body mass, irrespective of captive-rearing method. There was very little difference in the diet of captive-reared devils released onto Maria Island relative to wild mainland devils: Tasmanian pademelon, Thylogale billardierii, was the primary food item for both.Conclusions. The intensity of captive rearing did not affect the survival of devils released onto Maria Island. This suggests that even devils held in IC facilities retain the innate behaviour required to scavenge and hunt prey, and therefore maintain bodyweight post-release. The lack of any threatening processes on the island is also likely to have contributed to the high survival rate 2 years post-release.Implications. Our study provided preliminary evidence that the release of captive-raised Tasmanian devils onto off-shore islands is a viable conservation action. Captive-breeding programs and captive-raised founders can play a viable and valuable role in the conservation action plans for recovery programs of endangered carnivorous mammals.\"'], ['A systematic review of the impacts and management of introduced deer (family Cervidae) in Australia,\"By: Davis, Naomi E.; Bennett, Ami; Forsyth, David M.; et al.\",WILDLIFE RESEARCH  Volume: 43   Issue: 6   Pages: 515-532   Published: 2016,\"Deer are among the world\\'s most successful invasive mammals and can have substantial deleterious impacts on natural and agricultural ecosystems. Six species have established wild populations in Australia, and the distributions and abundances of some species are increasing. Approaches to managing wild deer in Australia are diverse and complex, with some populations managed as \\'game\\' and others as \\'pests\\'. Implementation of cost-effective management strategies that account for this complexity is hindered by a lack of knowledge of the nature, extent and severity of deer impacts. To clarify the knowledge base and identify research needs, we conducted a systematic review of the impacts and management of wild deer in Australia. Most wild deer are in south-eastern Australia, but bioclimatic analysis suggested that four species are well suited to the tropical and subtropical climates of northern Australia. Deer could potentially occupy most of the continent, including parts of the arid interior. The most significant impacts are likely to occur through direct effects of herbivory, with potentially cascading indirect effects on fauna and ecosystem processes. However, evidence of impacts in Australia is largely observational, and few studies have experimentally partitioned the impacts of deer from those of sympatric native and other introduced herbivores. Furthermore, there has been little rigorous testing of the efficacy of deer management in Australia, and our understanding of the deer ecology required to guide deer management is limited. We identified the following six priority research areas: (i) identifying long-term changes in plant communities caused by deer; (ii) understanding interactions with other fauna; (iii) measuring impacts on water quality; (iv) assessing economic impacts on agriculture (including as disease vectors); (v) evaluating efficacy of management for mitigating deer impacts; and (vi) quantifying changes in distribution and abundance. Addressing these knowledge gaps will assist the development and prioritisation of cost-effective management strategies and help increase stakeholder support for managing the impacts of deer on Australian ecosystems.\"'], ['Rickettsial infection in ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) of wild animals in midwestern Brazil,\"By: Witter, Rute; Martins, Thiago F.; Campos, Artur K.; et al.\",TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES  Volume: 7   Issue: 3   Pages: 415-423   Published: 2016,\"Ticks collected in the last two decades from free-living and captive wild animals from 28 municipalities of the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso were identified and tested using molecular methods for the presence of rickettsial agents.

Given the increasing prevalence and severity of diseases in marine wildlife, it is imperative to understand how pollutants affect the immune system and consequently disease susceptibility. Advancements and adaptations of analytical techniques have facilitated marine mammal immunotoxicology research. Field studies, captive-feeding experiments and in vitro laboratory studies with marine mammals have associated exposure to environmental pollutants, most notable polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides and heavy metals, to alterations of both the innate and adaptive arms of immune systems, which include aspects of cellular and humoral immunity. For marine mammals, reported immunotoxicology endpoints fell into several major categories: immune tissue histopathology, haematology/circulating immune cell populations, functional immune assays (lymphocyte proliferation, phagocytosis, respiratory burst, and natural killer cell activity), immunoglobulin production, and cytokine gene expression. Lymphocyte proliferation is by far the most commonly used immune assay, with studies using different organic pollutants and metals predominantly reporting immunosuppressive effects despite the many differences in study design and animal life history. Using combined field and laboratory data, we determined effect threshold levels for suppression of lymphocyte proliferation to be between 0.001-10 ppm for PCBs, 0.002-13 ppm for Hg, 0.009-0.06 for MeHg, and 0.1-2.4 for cadmium in polar bears and several pinniped and cetacean species. Similarly, thresholds for suppression of phagocytosis were 0.6-1.4 and 0.08-1.9 ppm for PCBs and mercury, respectively. Although data are lacking for many important immune endpoints and mechanisms of specific immune alterations are not well understood, this review revealed a systemic suppression of immune function in marine mammals exposed to environmental contaminants. Exposure to immunotoxic contaminants may have significant population level consequences as a contributing factor to increasing anthropogenic stress in wildlife and infectious disease outbreaks.

Vaccination and importation of dogs are prohibited on the Galapagos. Risk management of these hazards requires the use of science-based risk assessment and risk communication. The objectives of the study reported here were (i) to estimate the human:dog ratio and (ii) the prevalence of and identify exposure factors associated with positive antibody titers to canine distemper virus (CDV) and other pathogens, as well as infection with intestinal parasites in owned dogs on Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos in September 2014. The observed human:dog ratio was 6.148:1 which extrapolates to 2503 dogs (two times more than a recent dog count conducted by Galapagos Biosecurity Agency in March 2014). The proportion of spayed female dogs (50%) was higher, compared to neutered male dogs (30%) (p = 0.04). Prevalence of dogs with positive antibody titers to CDV was 36% (95% CI = 26, 46%), to canine parvovirus was 89% (95% CI = 82, 95%), and to canine adenovirus was 40% (95% CI = 30, 51%). The frequency of seropositive dogs to CDV was lower in urban dogs (26%), compared to rural dogs (53%) (p  0.05).A positive interaction effect between rural residence and spay/neuter status on seropositivity to CDV was observed, which we discuss in this report. Because vaccination is prohibited, the dog population on Santa Cruz is susceptible to an outbreak of CDV (particularly among urban dogs) with potential spill over to marine mammals. Dog\\'s age (1-2 or 3-14 years old, compared to younger dogs), and residence (rural, urban) were associated with positive antibody titers to parvovirus, adenovirus, Ehrlichia spp., or Anaplasma spp., as well as infection with Ancylostoma spp., an intestinal parasite in dogs that can be transmitted to humans, particularly children. These results provide the most comprehensive assessment of dog overpopulation and exposure to CDV and other pathogens on the Galapagos to date. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is still a lack of knowledge on the transmission dynamics within and between bat species, as well as from bats to other mammals. To better understand these processes, it is important to compare the phylogenetic relationships between different agents to that of their respective hosts. In this study, we analysed more than 950 urine, faeces and oral swab samples collected from 653 bats from mainly four species (Myotis nattereri, Myotis bechsteinii, Myotis daubentonii, and Plecotus auritus) for the presence of coronavirus, paramyxovirus and astrovirus related nucleic acids located in three different regions of Germany. Using hemi-nested reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR amplification of fragments within the highly conserved regions of the respective RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes, we detected astrovirus sequences at an overall detection rate of 25.8% of the analysed animals, with a maximum of 65% in local populations. The detection rates for coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses were distinctly lower, ranging between 1.4% and 3.1%. Interestingly, the sequence similarities in samples collected from the same bat species in different geographical areas were distinctly larger than the sequence similarities between samples from different species sampled at the same location. This indicates that host specificity may be more important than host ecology for the presence of certain viruses in bats. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the recent outbreak of dolphin morbillivirus in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean can provide new insights into the epidemiology and spatio-temporal spread of this pathogen. To deal with uncertainties surrounding the ecology of this system (only stranded animals were observed), we develop a statistical framework that can extract key information about the underlying transmission process given only sparse data. Our self-exciting Poisson process model suggests that individuals are infectious for at most 24 days and can transfer infection up to two latitude degrees (220 km) within this time. In addition, the effective reproduction number is generally below one, but reaches 2.6 during a period of heightened stranding numbers near Virginia Beach, Virginia, in summer 2013. Network analysis suggests local movements dominate spatial spread, with seasonal migration facilitating wider dissemination along the coast. Finally, a low virus transmission rate or high levels of pre-existing immunity can explain the lack of viral spread into the Gulf of Mexico. More generally, our approach illustrates novel methodologies for analysing very indirectly observed epidemics.\"'], ['The multiple and complex and changeable scenarios of the Trypanosoma cruzi transmission cycle in the sylvatic environment,\"By: Jansen, Ana Maria; Xavier, Samanta C. C.; Roque, Andre Luiz R.\",ACTA TROPICA  Volume: 151   Special Issue: SI   Pages: 1-15   Published: NOV 2015,\"In this study, we report and discuss the results generated from over 20 years of studies of the Trypanosoma cruzi sylvatic transmission cycle. Our results have uncovered new aspects and reviewed old concepts on issues including reservoirs, true generalist species, association of mammalian species with distinct discrete typing units - DTUs, distribution of T. cruzi genotypes in the wild, mixed infections, and T. cruzi transmission ecology. Using parasitological and serological tests, we examined T. cruzi infection in 7,285 mammalian specimens from nine mammalian orders dispersed all over the Brazilian biomes. The obtained T. cruzi isolates were characterized by mini-exon gene sequence polymorphism and PCR RFLP to identify DTUs. Infection by T. cruzi was detected by serological methods in 20% of the examined animals and isolated from 41% of those infected, corresponding to 8% of all the examined mammals. Each mammal taxon responded uniquely to T. cruzi infection. Didelphis spp. are able to maintain high and longlasting parasitemias (positive hemocultures) caused by Tcl but maintain and rapidly control parasitemias caused by TcII to almost undetectable levels. In contrast, the tamarin species Leontopithecus rosalia and L. chrysomelas maintain long-lasting and high parasitemias caused by TcII similarly to Philander sp. The coati Nasua nasua maintains high parasitemias by both parental T. cruzi DTUs TcI or TcII and by TcII/TcIV (formerly Z3) at detectable levels. Wild and domestic canidae seem to display only a short period of reservoir competence. T. cruzi infection was demonstrated in the wild canid species Cerdocyon thous and Chrysocyon brachyurus, and positive hemoculture was obtained in one hyper carnivore species (Leopardus pardalis), demonstrating that T. cruzi transmission is deeply immersed in the trophic net. T. cruzi DTU distribution in nature did not exhibit any association with a particular biome or habitat. Tcl predominates throughout (58% of the T. cruzi isolates); however, in spite of being significantly less frequent (17%), TcII is also widely distributed. Concomitant DTU infection occurred in 16% of infected mammals of all biomes and included arboreal and terrestrial species, as well as bats. TcI/TcIl concomitant infection was the most common and widely dispersed, with mixed TcI/TcII infections especially common in coatis and in Didelphimorphia. The second most common pattern of concomitant infection was Tcl/TclV, observed in Chiroptera, Didelphimorphia and Primates. Taken together, our results demonstrate the complexity of T. cruzi reservoir system and its transmission strategies, indicating that there is considerably more to be learned regarding ecology of T. cruzi.

Here, we examine the influence of host crowding and population age structure on pathogen transmission and diversity in bat populations. Focusing on two pathogen taxa of medical importance, Leptospira bacteria and paramyxoviruses, we monitored host population and pathogen shedding dynamics within a maternity colony of the tropical bat species Mormopterus francoismoutoui, endemic to Reunion Island. Our data reveal astonishingly similar infection dynamics for Leptospira and paramyxoviruses, with infection peaks during late pregnancy and 2 months after the initial birth pulse. Furthermore, although co-infection occurs frequently during the peaks of transmission, the patterns do not suggest any interaction between the two pathogens. Partial sequencing reveals a unique bat-specific Leptospira strain contrasting with the co-circulation of four separate paramyxovirus lineages along the whole breeding period. Patterns of infection highlight the importance of host crowding in pathogen transmission and suggest that most bats developed immune response and stop excreting pathogens. Our results support that bat maternity colonies may represent hot spots of transmission for bacterial and viral infectious agents, and highlight how seasonality can be an important determinant of host-parasite interactions and disease emergence.\"'], ['Landscape ecology of Trypanosoma cruzi in the southern Yucatan Peninsula,\"By: Antonio Lopez-Cancino, Sury; Tun-Ku, Ezequiel; Keynes De la Cruz-Felix, Himmler; et al.\",ACTA TROPICA  Volume: 151   Special Issue: SI   Pages: 58-72   Published: NOV 2015,\"Landscape interactions of Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc) with Triatoma dimidiata (Td) depend on the presence and relative abundance of mammal hosts.

Sylvatic mammals of the Chiroptera, Rodentia, and Marsupialia orders were captured, and livestock and pets were sampled along with T. dimidiata in all habitats. Infection by T. cruzi was analyzed using mtDNA markers, while lineage and DTU was analyzed using the mini-exon. 303 sylvatic specimens were collected, corresponding to 19 species during the rainy season and 114 specimens of 18 species during dry season. Five bats Artibeus jamaicensis, Artibeus lituratus, Stumira lilium, Sturnira ludovici, Dermanura phaeotis (Dp) and one rodent Heteromys gaumeri were collected in the three habitats. All but Dp, and including Carollia brevicauda and Myotis keaysi, were infected with predominately Tcl in the sylvatic habitat and TcII in the ecotone. Sigmodon hispidus was the rodent with the highest prevalence of infection by T. cruzi I and II in ecotone and domestic habitats. Didelphis viginiana was infected only with Tcl in both domestic and sylvatic habitats; the only two genotyped human cases were TcII. Two main clades of T. cruzi, lineages I (DTU Ia) and II (DTU VI), were found to be sympatric (all habitats and seasons) in the Zoh-Laguna landscape, suggesting that no species-specific interactions occur between the parasite and any mammal host, in any habitat. We have also found mixed infections of the two principal T. cruzi clades in individuals across modified habitats, particularly in livestock and pets, and in both haplogroups of T. dimidiata. Results are contradictory to the dilution hypothesis, although we did find that most resilient species had an important role as T. cruzi hosts. Our study detected some complex trends in parasite transmission related to lineage sorting within the matrix. Intriguingly, TcIa is dominant in terrestrial small wildlife in the sylvatic habitat and is the only parasite DTU found in D. virginiana in the domestic habitat, although its frequency remained constant in sylvatic and ecotone vectors. Bats have a key role in TcVI dispersal from the sylvatic habitat, while dogs, sheep, and humans are drivers of TcVI between domestic and ecotone habitats. Overall, our results allow us to conclude that T. cruzi transmission is dependent on host availability within a highly permeable landscape in Zoh Laguna. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Its regular transmission is through triatomines, which can easily transmit parasites either by the skin route (contamination of mammals skin with their feces) or by oral route (ingestion of food contaminated with complete triatomines or their feces) and additionally through haematogenous via (congenital and transfusional) and by tissues (transplants). The oral route, which seems to be the ancestral form of transmission to wild and domestic mammals, has recently become more important after the success achieved in the control of domicile vectors using residual pesticides. From its initial diagnosis in 1967, tens of oral outbreaks have been diagnosed mostly in the Brazilian Amazon and subsequently in other four countries in South America. Environmental imbalance caused by man through the invasion and deforestation of woodlands, results in reduction of biodiversity of mammals as food source for triatomines, affecting the \"\"dilution effect\"\" of T. cruzi in the nature increasing the risk of human infection. On the other hand, triatomines invade houses looking for new blood sources. One of the consequences of domiciliated triatomines is the food contamination spread, especially in home-made juices, which has been the source of infection of most oral outbreaks. Other biotic and abiotic factors help to explain the recent increase of oral transmission outbreaks of Chagas disease, distributed in nine eco-regions of America. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In Colombia, leishmaniasis is an endemic disease and 95% of all cases are cutaneous (CL), these cases have been reported in several regions of the country where the intervention of sylvatic areas by the introduction of agriculture seem to have an impact on the rearrangement of new transmission cycles. Our study aimed to update vector species distribution in the country and to analyze the relationship between vectors\\' distribution, climate, land use and CL prevalence.MethodsA database with geographic information was assembled, and ecological niche modeling was performed to explore the potential distribution of each of the 21 species of medical importance in Colombia, using thirteen bioclimatic variables, three topographic and three principal components derived from NDVI. Binary models for each species were obtained and related to both land use coverage, and a CL prevalence map with available epidemiological data. Finally, maps of species potential distribution were summed to define potential species richness in the country.ResultsIn total, 673 single records were obtained with Lutzomyia gomezi, Lutzomyia longipalpis, Psychodopygus panamensis, Psathyromyia shannoni and Pintomyia evansi the species with the highest number of records. Eighteen species had significant models, considering the area under the curve and the jackknife results: L. gomezi and P. panamensis had the widest potential distribution. All sand fly species except for Nyssomyia antunesi are mainly distributed in regions with rates of prevalence between 0.33 to 101.35 cases per 100,000 inhabitants and 76% of collection data points fall into transformed ecosystems.DiscussionDistribution ranges of sand flies with medical importance in Colombia correspond predominantly to disturbed areas, where the original land coverage is missing therefore increasing the domiciliation potential. We highlight the importance of the use of distribution maps as a tool for the development of strategies for prevention and control of diseases.\"'], ['Transmission ecology of rodent-borne diseases: New frontiers,\"By: Bordes, Frederic; Blasdell, Kim; Morand, Serge\",INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY  Volume: 10   Issue: 5   Pages: 424-435   Published: SEP 2015,\"Rodents are recognized reservoir hosts for many human zoonotic pathogens. The current trends resulting from anthropocene defaunation suggest that in the future they, along with other small mammals, are likely to become the dominant mammals in almost all human-modified environments. Recent intricate studies on bat-borne emerging diseases have highlighted that many gaps exist in our understanding of the zoonotic transmission of rodent-borne pathogens. This has emphasized the need for scientists interested in rodent-borne diseases to integrate rodent ecology into their analysis of rodent-borne pathogen transmission in order to identify in more detail the mechanisms of spillover and chains of transmission. Further studies are required to better understand the true impact of rodent abundance and the importance of pathogen sharing and circulation in multi-hostmulti-pathogen communities. We also need to explore in more depth the roles of generalist and abundant species as the potential links between pathogen-sharing, co-infections and disease transmission.\"'], ['Host density drives macroparasite abundance across populations of a critically endangered megaherbivore,\"By: Stringer, A. P.; Linklater, W. L.\",OECOLOGIA  Volume: 179   Issue: 1   Pages: 201-207   Published: SEP 2015,\"What determines the abundance of parasites is a central question within epidemiology. Epidemiological models predict that density-dependent transmission has a principal influence on parasite abundance. However, this mechanism is seldom tested in macroparasites, perhaps because multiple, comparable populations of the same host-parasite relationship are rare. We test the influence of a range of factors on parasite abundance across 18 populations of black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) in South Africa. Here we show that host density strongly predicts parasite abundance at the population level for both directly and indirectly transmitted parasites. All other models were not supported. The surprising influence of a single key factor, host density, within a complex ecological system demonstrates the validity of simple epidemiological models. Establishing this previously assumed relationship between host density and parasite abundance has major implications for disease control and parasite ecology. For instance, it is central to the idea of population density thresholds for parasitism, below which a parasite would become extinct. Density-dependent transmission is also essential for calculations of the basic reproductive number, and the hypothesis that parasites may regulate host population size.\"'], ['Reliability of molecular host-identification methods for ticks: an experimental in vitro study with Ixodes ricinus,\"By: Leger, Elsa; Liu, Xiangye; Masseglia, Sebastien; et al.\",PARASITES & VECTORS  Volume: 8     Article Number: 433   Published: AUG 22 2015,\"Background: Reliable information on host use by arthropod vectors is required to study pathogen transmission ecology and to predict disease risk. Direct observation of host use is often difficult or impossible and indirect methods are therefore necessary. However, the reliability of currently available methods to identify the last host of blood-feeding arthropods has not been evaluated, and may be particularly problematic for ticks because host blood has been digested at capture. Biases in host detection may lead to erroneous conclusions on both vector ecology and pathogen circulation.Methods: Here, we experimentally tested for biases in host detection using the generalist three-host tick Ixodes ricinus as a model system. We fed ticks using an artificial feeding system and amplified blood meal traces post-moult (i.e., in the succeeding unfed life stage) via both a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and a reverse line blotting method. We then experimentally tested for three types of biases in host detection: 1) time post-moult, 2) tick life stage and 3) host type (non-nucleated mammal blood versus nucleated avian blood), and compared these biases between the two molecular methods.Results: Our results show that all three factors can influence host detection in ticks but not necessarily in the expected way. Although host detection rates decreased with time post-moult, mammal blood tended to be more readily detected than bird blood. Tick life stage was also an important factor; detection was higher in nymphs than in adults and, in some cases, remnants from both larval and nymphal blood meals could be detected in the adult stage. These biases were similar for the two detection techniques.Conclusions: We show that different factors associated with questing ticks may influence our ability to correctly infer previous host use and that these factors may bias inferences from field-based studies. As these biases may be common to other vector-borne disease systems, their implications for our understanding of vector ecology and disease transmission require more explicit consideration.\"'], ['Rift Valley fever,\"By: Paweska, J. T.\",REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES  Volume: 34   Issue: 2   Pages: 375-389   Published: AUG 2015,\"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic viral disease affecting domestic and wild ruminants, camels and humans. The causative agent of RVF, the RVF virus (RVFV), has the capacity to cause large and severe outbreaks in animal and human populations and to cross significant natural geographic barriers. Rift Valley fever is usually inapparent in non-pregnant adult animals, but pregnant animals and newborns can be severely affected; outbreaks are characterised by a sudden onset of abortions and high neonatal mortality. The majority of human infections are subclinical or associated with moderate to severe, non-fatal, febrile illness, but some patients may develop a haemorrhagic syndrome and/or ocular and neurological lesions. In both animals and humans, the primary site of RVFV replication and tissue pathology is the liver. Outbreaks of RVF are associated with persistent high rainfalls leading to massive flooding and the emergence of large numbers of competent mosquito vectors that transmit the virus to a wide range of susceptible vertebrate species. Outbreaks of RVF have devastating economic effects on countries for which animal trade constitutes the main source of national revenue. The propensity of the virus to spread into new territories and re-emerge in traditionally endemic regions, where it causes large outbreaks in human and animal populations, presents a formidable challenge for public and veterinary health authorities. The presence of competent mosquito vectors in RVF-free countries, the wide range of mammals susceptible to the virus, altering land use, the global changes in climate, and increased animal trade and travel are some of the factors which might contribute to international spread of RVF.\"'], ['The Evolution of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli,\"By: Sheppard, Samuel K.; Maiden, Martin C.

These bacteria are a common component of the intestinal microbiota of numerous bird and mammal species and cause disease in humans, typically via consumption of contaminated meat products, especially poultry meat. Sequence-based molecular typing methods, such as multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and whole genome sequencing (WGS), have been instructive for understanding the epidemiology and evolution of these bacteria and how phenotypic variation relates to the high degree of genetic structuring in C. coli and C. jejuni populations. Here, we describe aspects of the relatively short history of coevolution between humans and pathogenic Campylobacter, by reviewing research investigating how mutation and lateral or horizontal gene transfer (LGT or HGT, respectively) interact to create the observed population structure. These genetic changes occur in a complex fitness landscape with divergent ecologies, including multiple host species, which can lead to rapid adaptation, for example, through frame-shift mutations that alter gene expression or the acquisition of novel genetic elements by HGT. Recombination is a particularly strong evolutionary force in Campylobacter, leading to the emergence of new lineages and even large-scale genome-wide interspecies introgression between C. jejuni and C. coli. The increasing availability of large genome datasets is enhancing understanding of Campylobacter evolution through the application of methods, such as genome-wide association studies, but MLST-derived clonal complex designations remain a useful method for describing population structure.\"'], ['Isolation of the Thogoto virus from a Haemaphysalis longicornis in Kyoto City, Japan,\"By: Yoshii, Kentaro; Okamoto, Natsumi; Nakao, Ryo; et al.\",JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY  Volume: 96   Pages: 2099-2103   Part: 8   Published: AUG 2015,\"Ticks transmit viruses responsible for severe emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, some of which have a significant impact on public health.

The Japanese isolate was genetically distinct from a cluster of other isolates from Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Various cell lines derived from mammals and ticks were susceptible to the isolate, but it was not pathogenic in mice.

A pilot study aimed to investigate wild rodents as reservoirs for zoonotic tick-borne pathogens (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum) was carried out in an area of Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park (Abruzzi Region, central Italy), a wide protected area where, despite sporadic reports of infection in humans and animals, eco-epidemiological data on these diseases are still not available. Rodents were trapped and released at the capture site after the collection of feeding ticks and blood samples. In all, 172 ticks were collected; the most frequent species was Ixodes acuminatus (53%). Out of 88 tick pools, 11 resulted positive for C. burnetii and 13 for B. burgdorferi s.l.; the Borrelia afzelii genospecies was identified in one Ixodes ricinus tick collected from one Apodemus sp. rodent. Out of 143 blood samples, seven Apodemus spp. and five Myodes glareolus were positive for B. burgdorferi s.l. and two Apodemus spp. were positive for C. burnetii. All samples (ticks and blood) were negative for F. tularensis and A. phagocytophilum. This is the first report of B. burgdorferi s.l. in the environment for Abruzzi Region. Data on the presence of B. burgdorferi s.l. are similar to that observed in other Mediterranean countries. The present work is also the first report of C. burnetii in wild rodents in Italy. C. burnetii infection has been largely investigated in Italy in ruminant farms by serology and molecular methods, but information on ecology and on the wild cycle are still lacking.

Among mammals, rodent species, including the house mouse Mus musculus, are identified as major invaders with profound impacts on native biodiversity, human health and activities. Though contemporary rodent invasions are described on several islands, there are few data describing ongoing house mouse invasions in continental areas. We first outline the known picture of the distribution of the house mouse in Africa. We then describe the ongoing range expansion of the house mouse in Senegal, in order to update its distribution area, assess the location of the invasion front, describe the spatio-temporal dynamics of the invasion at the country scale and evaluate its impact on native small mammal communities. We briefly review the worldwide status of the house mouse, with special focus on its situation in Africa. Focusing on Senegal, we then use historical records and a large body of spatio-temporal indoor trapping data obtained from small mammal communities over the last 30 years to analyse the invasion dynamics of the subspecies at the scale of the country. The geographic range of the invasive house mouse is surprisingly poorly known in Africa. In Senegal, we document a large range expansion of the subspecies in human settlements over the whole country within the last 30 years. The invasion is still ongoing further east and south within the country, and has major consequences for small mammal communities and thus probably for risks associated with zoonotic diseases.\"'], ['Peromyscus mice as a model for studying natural variation,\"By: Bedford, Nicole L.; Hoekstra, Hopi E.\",ELIFE  Volume: 4     Article Number: e06813   Published: JUN 17 2015,\"The deer mouse (genus Peromyscus) is the most abundant mammal in North America, and it occupies almost every type of terrestrial habitat.

The identified species of small mammals were categorized according to their dependence on urban environment as exoanthropic species, avoiding the presence of man and his habitations (A. sylvaticus, A. flavicollis, and Clethrionomys glareolus); hemisynantropic species, which thrive on the edges of towns, with greater or lesser affinity to humans (M. arvalis, Apodemus uralensis, Sorex araneus, Sorex minutus, Mus spicilegus, and Microtus subterraneus); and synanthropic species, tied to human dwellings, very dependent on human resources (Crocidura suaveolens).\"'], ['Association between body size and reservoir competence of mammals bearing Borrelia burgdorferi at an endemic site in the northeastern United States,\"By: Barbour, Alan G.; Bunikis, Jonas; Fish, Durland; et al.\",PARASITES & VECTORS  Volume: 8     Article Number: UNSP 299   Published: MAY 30 2015,\"Background: The reservoirs for the Lyme disease agent, Borrelia burgdorferi, are dominated by several different small to medium sized mammals in eastern North America.Findings: To experimentally assess the competence of different mammalian species to transmit this pathogen to ticks, we carried out quantitative species-specific PCR of individual nymphal Ixodes scapularis ticks, which had been collected as replete larvae from animals captured at a field site in eastern Connecticut and then allowed to molt in the laboratory. The mammals, in order of increasing body mass, were the white-footed mouse, pine vole, eastern chipmunk, gray squirrel, Virginia opossum, striped skunk, and common raccoon. The prevalence of infection in the nymphs and the counts of spirochetes in infected ticks allometrically scaled with body mass with exponents of -0.28 and -0.29, respectively. By species, the captured animals from the site differed significantly in the mean counts of spirochetes in the ticks recovered from them, but these associations could not be distinguished from an effect of body size per se.Conclusions: These empirical findings as well as inferences from modeling suggest that small mammals on the basis of their sizes are more competent as reservoirs of B. burgdorferi in this environment than medium-to large-sized mammals.\"'], ['Widespread Recombination, Reassortment, and Transmission of Unbalanced Compound Viral Genotypes in Natural Arenavirus Infections,\"By: Stenglein, Mark D.; Jacobson, Elliott R.; Chang, Li-Wen; et al.\",PLOS PATHOGENS  Volume: 11   Issue: 5     Article Number: e1004900   Published: MAY 2015,\"Arenaviruses are one of the largest families of human hemorrhagic fever viruses and are known to infect both mammals and snakes. Arenaviruses package a large (L) and small (S) genome segment in their virions. For segmented RNA viruses like these, novel genotypes can be generated through mutation, recombination, and reassortment. Although it is believed that an ancient recombination event led to the emergence of a new lineage of mammalian arenaviruses, neither recombination nor reassortment has been definitively documented in natural arenavirus infections. Here, we used metagenomic sequencing to survey the viral diversity present in captive arenavirus-infected snakes. From 48 infected animals, we determined the complete or near complete sequence of 210 genome segments that grouped into 23 L and 11 S genotypes. The majority of snakes were multiply infected, with up to 4 distinct S and 11 distinct L segment genotypes in individual animals. This S/L imbalance was typical: in all cases intrahost L segment genotypes outnumbered S genotypes, and a particular S segment genotype dominated in individual animals and at a population level. We corroborated sequencing results by qRT-PCR and virus isolation, and isolates replicated as ensembles in culture. Numerous instances of recombination and reassortment were detected, including recombinant segments with unusual organizations featuring 2 intergenic regions and superfluous content, which were capable of stable replication and transmission despite their atypical structures. Overall, this represents intrahost diversity of an extent and form that goes well beyond what has been observed for arenaviruses or for viruses in general. This diversity can be plausibly attributed to the captive intermingling of sub-clinically infected wild-caught snakes. Thus, beyond providing a unique opportunity to study arenavirus evolution and adaptation, these findings allow the investigation of unintended anthropogenic impacts on viral ecology, diversity, and disease potential.\"'], ['A pathological Late Pleistocene badger from San Sidero (Apulia, Southern Italy): Implications for developmental pathology and feeding behaviour,\"By: Iurino, Dawid A.; Fico, Rosario; Sardella, Raffaele\",QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL  Volume: 366   Pages: 96-101   Published: APR 24 2015,\"Among fossil vertebrates, oral pathologies are of particular interest, because of their considerable effect on teeth and maxillary/dentary bones and, as a consequence, on mastication and feeding behaviour. This study focused on a pathological left hemimandible referred to the mustelid Meles meles unearthed from a Late Pleistocene karst filling deposit at San Sidero (Apulia, South Italy). This fossil shows unusual marked abnormalities related to a rare case of nonodontogenic chronic suppurative osteomyelitis. Clinical diagnosis of the disease and the timing of its development have been defined on the basis of a veterinary approach and X-ray analyses. Such a pathological condition can be explained as a consequence of a wound due to a porcupine quill. The analysis of the injury also provides information about the biomechanics of the bite and on the feeding behaviour. The study case confirms how palaeopathological analyses can be considered valuable tools to reconstruct the physiology of animals that lived in the past and to depict in detail the interactions among Late Pleistocene mammals, thus allowing a more accurate reconstruction of the ecology in fossil mammals.

A long lag between the emergence of tick nymphs in spring and larvae in summer should increase transmission of persistent pathogens by allowing infected nymphs to inoculate the population of naive hosts that can subsequently transmit the pathogen to larvae to complete the transmission cycle. In contrast, greater synchrony between nymphs and larvae should facilitate transmission of pathogens that do not produce long-lasting infections in hosts. Here, we use 19 years of data on blacklegged ticks attached to small-mammal hosts to quantify the relationship between climate warming and tick phenology. Warmer years through May and August were associated with a nearly three-week advance in the phenology of nymphal and larval ticks relative to colder years, with little evidence of increased synchrony. Warmer Octobers were associated with fewer larvae feeding concurrently with nymphs during the following spring. Projected warming by the 2050s is expected to advance the timing of average nymph and larva activity by 8-11 and 10-14 days, respectively. If these trends continue, climate warming should maintain or increase transmission of persistent pathogens, while it might inhibit pathogens that do not produce long-lasting infections.\"'], ['Epidemiology of hepatitis E virus infection in Spain,\"By: Manuel Echevarria, Jose; Fogeda, Marta; Avellon, Ana\",ENFERMEDADES INFECCIOSAS Y MICROBIOLOGIA CLINICA  Volume: 33   Issue: 4   Pages: 281-286   Published: APR 2015,\"The general features of the epidemiology and ecology of hepatitis E virus in Spain are already known after 20 years of investigations. Genotype 3 strains, mainly from sub-genotype 3f, circulated among swine livestock and certain wild mammals, and would be sporadically transmitted to humans through direct contact with the reservoirs or by consumption of foods derived from them. Bivalve shellfish contaminated by hepatitis E virus from sewage could also play a role in transmission. Although the interpretation of results from seroprevalence studies in low endemic settings is still controversial, antibody to hepatitis E virus displays an overall prevalence less than 10% among the population of Spain, increasing significantly with age. From the, approximately, 150 cases of acute hepatitis E recorded in the international literature, males older than 40 years, suffering a mild, locally atquired disease predominate. In addition, hepatitis E might be more frequent in the North of the country than in other regions. Although the disease does not usually have a great clinical relevance, the occasional finding of cases of fulminant hepatitis, and of ribavirin-resistant, chronic hepatitis E virus infections among the immunocompromised would recommend the surveillance of the infection by the public health authority and a better implementation of specific diagnostic procedures in clinical laboratories.

The ecology of this parasite in marine systems is poorly understood, although many marine mammals are infected and susceptible to clinical toxoplasmosis. We summarized the lesions associated with T. gondii infection in the California sea lion (Zalophus californtanus) population and investigated the prevalence of and risk factors associated with T. gondii exposure, as indicated by antibody. Five confirmed and four suspected cases of T. gondii infection were identified by analysis of 1,152 medical records of necropsied sea lions from 1975-2009. One suspected and two confirmed cases were identified in aborted fetuses from a sea lion rookery. Toxoplasmosis was the primary cause of death in five cases, including the two fetuses. Gross and histopathologic findings in T. gondii-infected sea lions were similar to those reported in other marine mammals. The most common lesions were encephalitis, meningitis, and myocarditis. The antibody prevalence in stranded, free-ranging sea lions for 1998-2009 was 2.5% (0.03%; IgG titer 640). There was an increase in odds of exposure in sea lions with increasing age, suggesting cumulative risk of exposure and persistent antibody over time. The occurrence of disseminated T. gondii infection in aborted fetuses confirms vertical transmission in sea lions, and the increasing odds of exposure with age is consistent with additional opportunities for horizontal transmission in free-ranging sea lions over time. These data suggest that T. gondii may have two modes of transmission in the sea lion population. Overall, clinical disease was uncommon in our study which, along with low prevalence of T. gondii antibody, suggests substantially less-frequent exposure and lower susceptibility to clinical disease in California sea lions as compared to sympatric southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis).\"'], ['Are Members of the Triatoma brasiliensis (Hemiptera, Reduviidae) Species Complex Able to Alter the Biology and Virulence of a Trypanosoma cruzi Strain?,\"By: Costa, J.; Araujo, C.

Despite the extensive literature on vectors and the etiologic agent, several interactive aspects between these two elements of Chagas disease are still waiting to be further clarified. Here, biological and histological features resulting from the interaction between Albino Swiss mice and T. cruzi isolate PB913 after passages through vectors of the Triatoma brasiliensis species complex were evaluated.

At 20 days post-infection, the highest number of parasites was observed in the group of mice that were infected with parasites obtained from T. b. macromelasoma. Tropism of the parasites to different organs such as heart, bladder, and skeletal muscles followed by inflammatory cell infiltrates was observed with quantitative and qualitative differences. Even though the four members of the T. brasiliensis species complex differ in their geographical distribution, morphology, biology, ecology, and genetics, no significant influence on the parasitemia of the T. cruzi PB913 isolate was detected.

To better define parameters for targeted possum control and TB surveillance, we here applied a novel approach to analyzing GPS data obtained from 44 possums fitted with radio-tracking collars, producing estimates of the animals\\' short-term nocturnal foraging patterns based on 1-, 3- or 5-nights\\' contiguous data. Studies were conducted within two semi-arid montane regions of New Zealand\\'s South Island High Country: these regions support low-density possum populations (2 possums/ha) in which the animals\\' home ranges are on average larger than in high-density populations in forested habitat. Possum foraging range width (FRW) estimates increased with increasing monitoring periods, from 150-200m based on a single night\\'s movement data to 300-400m based on 5 nights\\' data. The largest average FRW estimates were recorded in winter and spring, and the smallest in summer. The results suggest that traps or poison-bait stations (for lethal control) or monitoring devices (for TB surveillance), set for 3 consecutive nights at 150 minterval spacings, would likely place 95% of the possums in this type of habitat at risk of encountering these devices, year-round. Modelling control efficacy against operational expenditure, based on these estimations, identified the relative cost-effectiveness of various strategies that could be applied to a typical aerial poisoning operation, to reduce the ongoing TB vectorial risk that possums pose in the High Country regions. These habitat-specific findings are likely to be more relevant than the conventional pest control and monitoring methodologies developed for possums in their more typical forested habitat.\"'], ['Feeding Ecology Informs Parasite Epidemiology: Prey Selection Modulates Encounter Rate with Echinococcus multilocularis in Urban Coyotes,\"By: Liccioli, Stefano; Bialowas, Carly; Ruckstuhl, Kathreen E.; et al.\",PLOS ONE  Volume: 10   Issue: 3     Article Number: e0121646   Published: MAR 13 2015,\"We investigated the role of urban coyote feeding ecology in the transmission of Echinococcus multilocularis, the causative agent of Alveolar Echinococcosis in humans. As coyotes can play a main role in the maintenance of this zoonotic parasite within North American urban settings, such study can ultimately aid disease risk management. Between June 2012 and June 2013, we collected 251 coyote feces and conducted trapping of small mammals (n = 971) in five parks in the city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. We investigated E. multilocularis epidemiology by assessing seasonal variations of coyote diet and the selective consumption of different rodent intermediate host species. Furthermore, accounting for small mammal digestibility and coyote defecation rates we estimated the number of small mammal preys ingested by coyote and consequently, coyote encounter rates with the parasite. Dominant food items included small mammals, fruit and vegetation, although hare and deer were seasonally relevant. The lowest frequency of occurrence per scat of small mammals was recorded in winter (39.4 %), when consumption of deer was highest (36.4 %). However, highest encounter rates (number of infected hosts predated/season) with E. multilocularis (95% CI: 1.0 - 22.4), combined with the lack of predation on non-competent small mammal species, suggest that winter is the critical season for transmission and control of this parasite. Within the small mammal assemblage, voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus and Myodes gapperi) were the selected preys of urban coyotes and likely played a key role for the maintenance of the urban sylvatic life-cycle of E. multilocularis in Calgary.\"'], ['Effects of anthropogenic and demographic factors on patterns of parasitism in African small mammal communities,\"By: Salzer, Johanna S.; Carroll, Darin S.; Williams-Newkirk, Amanda Jo; et al.\",PARASITOLOGY  Volume: 142   Issue: 3   Pages: 512-522   Published: MAR 2015,\"Habitat disturbance often results in alterations in community structure of small mammals. Additionally, the parasites harboured by these small mammals may be impacted by environmental changes or indirectly affected by changes in available hosts. To improve our understanding of this interplay, we examined the patterns of parasitism in small mammal communities from a variety of habitats in forested Uganda. Small mammals were collected from areas experiencing variable habitat disturbance, host density and species richness. The analysis focused on 3 most abundant rodent species, Lophuromys aquilus, Praomys jacksoni and Hylomyscus stella, and a diverse group of parasites they harbour. The impact of various habitat and host community factors on parasite prevalence was examined using linear regression and Spearman\\'s rank-order correlation. We further investigated the parasite communities associated with each individual using correspondence analysis. We determined that, parasite prevalence and richness may be occasionally influenced by community and habitat factors, but taxonomy is a driving force in influencing the parasite community harboured by an individual host. Ultimately, applying general principles across a broad range of disturbance levels and diverse host communities needs to be approached with caution in complex communities.\"'], ['Dog ownership, abundance and potential for bat-borne rabies spillover in Chile,\"By: Astorga, F.; Escobar, L. E.; Poo-Munoz, D. A.; et al.\",PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE  Volume: 118   Issue: 4   Pages: 397-405   Published: MAR 1 2015,\"Rabies is a viral infectious disease that affects all mammals, including humans. Factors associated with the incidence of rabies include the presence and density of susceptible hosts and potential reservoirs. Currently, Chile is declared free of canine-related rabies, but there is an overpopulation of dogs within the country and an emergence of rabies in bats. Our objectives are to determine potential areas for bat-borne rabies spillover into dog populations expressed as a risk map, and to explore some key features of dog ownership, abundance, and management in Chile. For the risk map, our variables included a dog density surface (dog/km(2)) and a distribution model of bat-borne rabies presence. From literature review, we obtained dog data from 112 municipalities, which represent 33% of the total municipalities (339). At country level, based on previous studies the median human per dog ratio was 4.8, with 64% of houses containing at least one dog, and a median of 0.9 dog per house. We estimate a national median of 5.3 dog/km(2), and a median of 3680 dogs by municipality, from which we estimate a total population of 3.5 x 1(0)6 owned dogs. The antirabies vaccination presented a median of 21% of dogs by municipality, and 29% are unrestricted to some degree. Human per dog ratio have a significant (but weak) negative association with human density. Unrestricted dogs have a negative association with human density and income, and a positive association with the number of dogs per house. Considering dog density by municipality, and areas of potential bat-borne rabies occurrence, we found that 163 (similar to 48%) of Chilean municipalities are at risk of rabies spillover from bats to dogs. Risk areas are concentrated in urban settlements, including Santiago, Chile\\'s capital. To validate the risk map, we included cases of rabies in dogs from the last 27 years; all fell within high-risk areas of our map, confirming the assertive risk prediction. Our results suggest that the use of dog population parameters may be informative to determine risk areas for bat-rabies spillover events. In addition, we confirm that dog abundance is a neglected and emerging public health concern in Chile, particularly within urban areas, which deserves prompt intervention.

Physiological processes associated with metabolism shape tissue stable isotope ratios, and as such the spacing between stable isotope ratios of diet and tissue may be influenced by processes such as growth, nutritional stress, and disease. Here, we develop a model of incorporation stable isotopes in diet to tissues by coupling stable isotope dynamics to a model of macronutrient energy metabolism. We use the model to explore the effect of changes in dietary intake, both composition and amount, and in energy expenditure, on body mass and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of tissue.

In this review, we argue that mammalogists are uniquely placed to contribute to addressing these challenges because in-depth knowledge of mammal species is fundamental to the development of wild model systems that could accelerate discovery in disease ecology. The use of animal models-species for which a broad range of diagnostic, molecular, and genetic tools have been developed-in tightly controlled laboratory environments has been instrumental in driving progress in the biomedical sciences. However, in natural populations, disease processes operate in the context of enormous genetic, phenotypic, and environmental variability. Understanding diseases in animal populations (including humans) thus requires investment in \"\"wild animal models\"\" that explicitly include individual variation and relevant environmental gradients. Wild mammal groups such as primates and rodents have already been identified as potentially useful models of infectious diseases in the wild. Here, we discuss the enormous potential that ungulates hold as candidates for wild model systems. The diversity, broad geographic distribution, and often high abundance of species in this group make them a highly accessible target for disease research. Moreover, a depth of background knowledge, close relationships to domesticated animals, and ongoing management of many wild ungulate species provide context, tools, and opportunity for cutting-edge research at the interface of ecological and biomedical sciences. Studies of wild ungulates are already helping to unravel some key challenges in infectious disease research, including the role of parasites in trophic cascades, the consequences of climate change for disease dynamics, and the systems biology of host-parasite interactions. Other areas where ungulate studies may provide new insight include research on the sources and drivers of emerging infectious diseases.\"'], ['Co-feeding transmission in Lyme disease pathogens,\"By: Voordouw, Maarten J.\",PARASITOLOGY  Volume: 142   Issue: 2   Pages: 290-302   Published: FEB 2015,\"This review examines the phenomenon of co-feeding transmission in tick-borne pathogens. This mode of transmission is critical for the epidemiology of several tick-borne viruses but its importance for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis, is still controversial. The molecular mechanisms and ecological factors that facilitate co-feeding transmission are therefore examined with particular emphasis on Borrelia pathogens. Comparison of climate, tick ecology and experimental infection work suggests that co-feeding transmission is more important in European than North American systems of Lyme borreliosis, which potentially explains why this topic has gained more traction in the former continent than the latter. While new theory shows that co-feeding transmission makes a modest contribution to Borrelia fitness, recent experimental work has revealed new ecological contexts where natural selection might favour co-feeding transmission. In particular, co-feeding transmission might confer a fitness advantage in the Darwinian competition among strains in mixed infections. Future studies should investigate the ecological conditions that favour the evolution of this fascinating mode of transmission in tick-borne pathogens.\"'], ['Ecology, conservation and human history of marine mammals in the Gulf of California and Pacific coast of Baja California, Mexico,\"By: Arellano-Peralta, Veronica A.; Medrano-Gonzalez, Luis\",OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT  Volume: 104   Pages: 90-105   Published: FEB 2015,\"In total, 43 marine mammal species, eight of which are threatened, inhabit the Gulf of California and Pacific coast of Baja California. The unique attributes of marine mammal fauna such as species richness, risk condition, energy consumption and calving in this region are historically and geographically important. Marine mammals in the Baja California seas have been hunted for the past 10,000 years and they are also currently subject to severe anthropogenic impacts. Commercial hunting started in the late 18th century and some populations declined until the 1970s. Anthropogenic impacts on marine mammals diversified during the 20th century, with fisheries and pollution now being their greatest threats. Currently, the coasts surrounding Baja California seas are home to 3.06% of Mexican people and 1.77% live in relation with maritime activities. This is a relatively small population that has been growing since the Spanish conquest in the 16th century together with decimation of the regional indigenous populations. The scarce people around Baja California seas have important contributions to Mexican economy and marine disturbance, mostly because the arid environments of northwestern Mexico have historically encouraged marine fisheries as the major intake of natural living resources in the region. Therefore, the region\\'s environmental problems do not stem from an overpopulation requiring ecosystem services, with the exception that exhaustion of the underground aquifers is of great concern, but from historical Problems related with social and economic development. Conservation of marine mammals in the Baja California seas may be helpful to geographically and socially integrate human development and ecosystem protection, to address current problems of illegality, sectorial conflicts and partiality in conservation actions as well as to monitor the modifications and functionality of the marine ecosystem.

The aetiological agent, a protozoan named Trypanosoma cruzi, is mainly transmitted to mammalian hosts by triatomine vectors. Multiple species of mammals and triatomines can harbour and transmit the parasite, and the feeding range of triatomine species typically includes many noncompetent hosts. Furthermore, the transmission of the pathogen can occur via several routes including the typical vector\\'s faeces, but also oral, congenital and blood transfusion routes. These ecological and epidemiological complexities of the disease have hindered many control initiatives. In such a context, mathematical models provide invaluable tools to explore and understand the dynamics of T. cruzi transmission, and to design, optimize and monitor the efficacy of control interventions. We intend here to provide the first review of the mathematical models of Chagas disease, focussing on how they have contributed to our understanding of (1) the population dynamics and control of triatomine vectors, and (2) the epidemiology of T. cruzi infections. We also aim at suggesting promising lines of modelling that could further improve our understanding of the ecology, evolution, and control of the disease.\"'], ['Occurrence of Human Pathogenic Bacteria and Toxoplasma gondii in Cetaceans Stranded in the Philippines: Providing Clues on Ocean Health Status,\"By: Obusan, Marie Christine M.; Aragones, Lemnuel V.; Salibay, Cristina C.; et al.\",AQUATIC MAMMALS  Volume: 41   Issue: 2   Pages: 149-166   Published: 2015,\"The general consensus of a rapidly changing ocean ecosystem being affected by anthropogenic activities needs to be understood in relation to both wildlife and human health. The risks and challenges for the Philippines include lack of scientific information on waterborne diseases that are potentially zoonotic. The present study fills in this knowledge gap by detecting the occurrence of bacteria, Giardia, and Toxoplasma gondii in locally found cetacean species. Cetaceans (n = 30) that stranded from January 2012 through March 2013 were appropriately responded to, and biological materials were taken whenever applicable. A total of 25 bacteria were isolated from nine stranders. Phenotypic and genotypic methods of isolate identification yielded 12 consensus genera: Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Burkholderia, Enterococcus, Moraxella, Proteus, Providencia, Rhizobium, Serratia, Sphingomonas, Staphylococcus, and Vibrio. No screened strander was positive for Giardia. Serological assay detected antibodies for T. gondii in five stranders, while nested polymerase chain reaction positively amplified the B1 gene of the parasite in two stranders. This study provides the first report on bacteria and T. gondii in cetaceans found in the Philippines. Since the detected microorganisms include species recognized to cause new infections in marine mammals worldwide, the findings of the study underscore the potential of stranded cetaceans to serve as sentinels for studying the movement of emerging pathogens in marine habitats, provide clues on the health status of their free-ranging populations, and present the health risks available to humans who share the same water resource with them.\"'], ['Host preferences of immature Dermacentor reticulatus (Acari: Ixodidae) in a forest habitat in Germany,\"By: Pfaeffle, Miriam; Littwin, Nina; Petney, Trevor\",TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES  Volume: 6   Issue: 4   Pages: 508-515   Published: 2015,\"Dermacentor reticulatus is widespread throughout Europe and is expanding its range in several European countries. It is associated with a number of different pathogens. Its role in the transmission of disease to humans is currently small; however, it might play an important role in the maintenance of pathogens in enzootic cycles. The ecology of D. reticulatus, especially of the immatures, is not well known. In this study, ticks from small mammals, caught in a capture-mark-release study between May 2012 and October 2014 in a unique woodland area close to Karlsruhe, Germany, were collected. The main host species trapped were the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) and the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Small mammal populations showed high variability in their density between the study years, which is probably due to harsh winter conditions in 2012/2013 and missing mast leading to high winter mortality. Larvae and nymphs of D. reticulatus were predominantly found in July and August, respectively, and the infestation rates among the different small mammal species suggest a host preference of D. reticulatus for M. glareolus.

A recent study showed that 12% of mongooses carried Salmonella spp. in their large intestines. We investigated whether anthropogenic, environmental and climatic variables predicted Salmonella status in mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus) in Grenada. Using multivariate logistic regression and contingency table analysis, we found that increased human density, decreased distance from roads, and low monthly precipitation were associated with increased probability of Salmonella carriage. Areas with higher human density likely support a higher abundance of mongooses because of greater food availability. These areas also are a likely source for infection to mongooses due to high densities of livestock and rodents shedding Salmonella. The higher probability of Salmonella carriage in mongooses during drier months and closer to roadsides is likely due to water drainage patterns and limited water availability. Although the overall prevalence of Salmonella in mongooses was moderate, the strong patterns of ecologic correlates, combined with the high density of mongooses throughout Grenada suggest that the small Indian mongoose could be a useful sentinel for Salmonella surveillance. Its affinity for human-associated habitats suggests that the small Indian mongoose is also a risk factor in the maintenance and possible spread of Salmonella species to humans and livestock in Grenada.\"'], ['An Investigation of Bartonella spp., Rickettsia typhi, and Seoul Hantavirus in Rats (Rattus spp.) from an Inner-City Neighborhood of Vancouver, Canada: Is Pathogen Presence a Reflection of Global and Local Rat Population Structure?,\"By: Himsworth, Chelsea G.; Bai, Ying; Kosoy, Michael Y.; et al.\",VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES  Volume: 15   Issue: 1   Special Issue: SI   Pages: 21-26   Published: JAN 1 2015,\"Urban Norway and black rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus) are reservoirs for variety of zoonotic pathogens. Many of these pathogens, including Rickettsia typhi, Bartonella spp., and Seoul hantavirus (SEOV), are thought to be endemic in rat populations worldwide; however, past field research has found these organisms to be absent in certain rat populations. Rats (Rattus spp.) from an inner city neighborhood of Vancouver, Canada, were tested for exposure to and/or infection with SEOV and R. typhi (using serology and PCR), as well as Bartonella spp. (using culture and sequencing). Approximately 25% of 404 rats tested were infected with Bartonella tribocorum, which demonstrated significant geographic clustering within the study area. Infection was associated with both season and sexual maturity. Seroreactivity against R. typhi and SEOV was observed in 0.36% and 1.45% of 553 rats tested, respectively, although PCR screening results for these pathogens were negative, suggesting that they are not endemic in the study population. Overall, these results suggest that the geographic distribution of rat-associated zoonoses, including R. typhi, SEOV, and Bartonella spp., is less ubiquitous than previously appreciated, and is likely dependent on patterns of dispersion and establishment of the rat reservoir host. Further study on global and local Rattus spp. population structures may help to elucidate the ecology of zoonotic organisms in these species.\"'], ['Seasonal Patterns of Mixed Species Groups in Large East African Mammals,\"By: Kiffner, Christian; Kioko, John; Leweri, Cecilia; et al.\",PLOS ONE  Volume: 9   Issue: 12     Article Number: UNSP e113446   Published: DEC 3 2014,\"Mixed mammal species groups are common in East African savannah ecosystems. Yet, it is largely unknown if co-occurrences of large mammals result from random processes or social preferences and if interspecific associations are consistent across ecosystems and seasons. Because species may exchange important information and services, understanding patterns and drivers of heterospecific interactions is crucial for advancing animal and community ecology. We recorded 5403 single and multi-species clusters in the Serengeti-Ngorongoro and Tarangire-Manyara ecosystems during dry and wet seasons and used social network analyses to detect patterns of species associations. We found statistically significant associations between multiple species and association patterns differed spatially and seasonally. Consistently, wildebeest and zebras preferred being associated with other species, whereas carnivores, African elephants, Maasai giraffes and Kirk\\'s dik-diks avoided being in mixed groups. During the dry season, we found that the betweenness (a measure of importance in the flow of information or disease) of species did not differ from a random expectation based on species abundance. In contrast, in the wet season, we found that these patterns were not simply explained by variations in abundances, suggesting that heterospecific associations were actively formed. These seasonal differences in observed patterns suggest that interspecific associations may be driven by resource overlap when resources are limited and by resource partitioning or anti-predator advantages when resources are abundant. We discuss potential mechanisms that could drive seasonal variation in the cost-benefit tradeoffs that underpin the formation of mixed-species groups.\"'], ['A random forest approach for predicting the presence of Echinococcus multilocularis intermediate host Ochotona spp. presence in relation to landscape characteristics in western China,\"By: Marston, Christopher G.; Danson, F.

Here, random forests are employed to model spatial patterns of the presence of the plateau pika (Ochotona spp.) small mammal intermediate host for the parasitic tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis which is responsible for a significant burden of human zoonoses in western China. Landsat ETM + satellite imagery and digital elevation model data were utilized to generate quantified measures of environmental characteristics across a study area in Sichuan Province, China. Land cover maps were generated identifying the distribution of specific land cover types, with landscape metrics employed to describe the spatial organisation of land cover patches. Random forests were used to model spatial patterns of Ochotona spp. presence, enabling the relative importance of the environmental characteristics in relation to Ochotona spp. presence to be ranked. An index of habitat aggregation was identified as the most important variable in influencing Ochotona spp. presence, with area of degraded grassland the most important land cover class variable. 71% of the variance in Ochotona spp. presence was explained, with a 90.98% accuracy rate as determined by \\'out-of-bag\\' error assessment. Identification of the environmental characteristics influencing Ochotona spp. presence enables us to better understand distribution patterns of hosts implicated in the transmission of Em. The predictive mapping of this Em host enables the identification of human populations at increased risk of infection, enabling preventative strategies to be adopted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Host diversity is thought to play a role in Lyme disease risk, and it has been suggested that the direction of the relationship between host diversity and disease risk may vary depending on the spatial scale of observation. Here we modelled the effect of mammal host species richness on the incidence of Lyme disease from 1992 to 2011 across all states in the United States with reported or established black-legged tick ( Ixodes scapularis) populations. We tested two contrasting hypotheses: a positive vs. a negative relationship between host species richness and Lyme disease incidence. We also tested the hypothesis that the strength of the diversity-disease-risk relationship increased over time, as Lyme disease spread. We observed a strong negative relationship between mammal host species richness and Lyme disease incidence, and this relationship became more negative over time. Lyme disease increased over time more rapidly in host species-poor states than host species-rich states. Our findings support the importance of mammal host richness on Lyme disease risk at large spatial scales, and the importance of spatial and temporal scales on the diversity-disease relationship.\"'], ['Human migration is important in the international spread of exotic Salmonella serovars in animal and human populations,\"By: Iveson, J.

In this study, the distribution and prevalence of exotic Salmonella serovars are mapped to assess the extent to which introduced infections are invading native wildlife in areas of high natural biodiversity under threat from expanding human activity. The major exotic Salmonella serovars, Bovismorbificans, Derby, Javiana, Newport, Panama, Saintpaul and Typhimurium, isolated from wildlife on populated coastal islands in southern temperate areas of Western Australia, were mostly absent from reptiles and native mammals in less populated tropical areas of the state. They were also not recorded on the uninhabited Mitchell Plateau or islands of the Bonaparte Archipelago, adjacent to south-eastern Indonesia. Exotic serovars were, however, isolated in wildlife on 14/17 islands sampled in the Wallacea region of Indonesia and several islands off the west coast of Perth. Increases in international tourism, involving islands such as Bali, have resulted in the isolation of a high proportion of exotic serovar infections suggesting that densely populated island resorts in the Asian region are acting as staging posts for the interchange of Salmonella infections between tropical and temperate regions.\"'], ['MINIMAL ROLE OF EASTERN FENCE LIZARDS IN BORRELIA BURGDORFERI TRANSMISSION IN CENTRAL NEW JERSEY OAK/PINE WOODLANDS,\"By: Rulison, Eric L.; Kerr, Kaetlyn T.; Dyer, Megan C.; et al.\",JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY  Volume: 100   Issue: 5   Pages: 578-582   Published: OCT 2014,\"The eastern fence lizard, Sceloporus undulatus, is widely distributed in eastern and central North America, ranging through areas with high levels of Lyme disease, as well as areas where Lyme disease is rare or absent.

The infestation rate of ticks on fence lizards was extremely low (prevalence = 0.087, n = 23) compared to that on white-footed mice and other small mammals (prevalence = 0.53, n = 140). Of 159 nymphs that had fed as larvae on lizards that had previously been exposed to infected nymphs, none was infected with B. burgdorferi, compared with 79.9% of 209 nymphs that had fed as larvae on infected control mice. Simulations suggest that changes in the numbers of fence lizards in a natural habitat would have little effect on the infection rate of nymphal ticks with Lyme spirochetes.

Previous indirect evidence and theoretical models support squirrelpox virus (SQPV) as being potentially involved in the decline of red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) following the introduction of the non-native gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) to the United Kingdom. The red squirrel is a major UK conservation concern and understanding its continuing decline is important for any attempt to mitigate the decline. The red squirrel-gray squirrel system is also exemplary of the interplay between infectious disease (apparent competition) and direct competition in driving the replacement of a native by an invasive species. Time series data from Merseyside are presented on squirrel abundance and squirrelpox disease (SQPx) incidence, to determine the effect of the pathogen and the nonnative species on the native red squirrel populations. Analysis indicates that SQPx in red squirrels has a significant negative impact on squirrel densities and their population growth rate (PGR). There is little evidence for a direct gray squirrel impact; only gray squirrel presence (but not density) proved to influence red squirrel density, but not red squirrel PGR. The dynamics of red SQPx cases are largely determined by previous red SQPx cases, although previous infection of local gray squirrels also feature, and thus, SQPV-infected gray squirrels are identified as potentially initiating outbreaks of SQPx in red squirrels. Retrospective serology indicates that approximately 8% of red squirrels exposed to SQPV may survive infection during an epidemic. This study further highlights the UK red squirrel - gray squirrel system as a classic example of a native species population decline strongly facilitated by infectious disease introduced by a non-native species. It is therefore paramount that disease prevention and control measures are integral in attempts to conserve red squirrels in the United Kingdom.\"'], ['Age-Related Declines and Disease-Associated Variation in Immune Cell Telomere Length in a Wild Mammal,\"By: Beirne, Christopher; Delahay, Richard; Hares, Michelle; et al.\",PLOS ONE  Volume: 9   Issue: 9     Article Number: e108964   Published: SEP 30 2014,\"Immunosenescence, the deterioration of immune system capability with age, may play a key role in mediating age-related declines in whole-organism performance, but the mechanisms that underpin immunosenescence are poorly understood. Biomedical research on humans and laboratory models has documented age and disease related declines in the telomere lengths of leukocytes (\\'immune cells\\'), stimulating interest their having a potentially general role in the emergence of immunosenescent phenotypes. However, it is unknown whether such observations generalise to the immune cell populations of wild vertebrates living under ecologically realistic conditions. Here we examine longitudinal changes in the mean telomere lengths of immune cells in wild European badgers (Meles meles). Our findings provide the first evidence of within-individual age-related declines in immune cell telomere lengths in a wild vertebrate. That the rate of age-related decline in telomere length appears to be steeper within individuals than at the overall population level raises the possibility that individuals with short immune cell telomeres and/or higher rates of immune cell telomere attrition may be selectively lost from this population. We also report evidence suggestive of associations between immune cell telomere length and bovine tuberculosis infection status, with individuals detected at the most advanced stage of infection tending to have shorter immune cell telomeres than disease positive individuals. While male European badgers are larger and show higher rates of annual mortality than females, we found no evidence of a sex difference in either mean telomere length or the average rate of within-individual telomere attrition with age. Our findings lend support to the view that age-related declines in the telomere lengths of immune cells may provide one potentially general mechanism underpinning age-related declines in immunocompetence in natural populations.\"'], ['Detection of Zoonotic Pathogens and Characterization of Novel Viruses Carried by Commensal Rattus norvegicus in New York City,\"By: Firth, Cadhla; Bhat, Meera; Firth, Matthew A.; et al.\",MBIO  Volume: 5   Issue: 5     Article Number: e01933-14   Published: SEP-OCT 2014,\"Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are globally distributed and concentrate in urban environments, where they live and feed in closer proximity to human populations than most other mammals. Despite the potential role of rats as reservoirs of zoonotic diseases, the microbial diversity present in urban rat populations remains unexplored. In this study, we used targeted molecular assays to detect known bacterial, viral, and protozoan human pathogens and unbiased high-throughput sequencing to identify novel viruses related to agents of human disease in commensal Norway rats in New York City. We found that these rats are infected with bacterial pathogens known to cause acute or mild gastroenteritis in people, including atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, and Salmonella enterica, as well as infectious agents that have been associated with undifferentiated febrile illnesses, including Bartonella spp., Streptobacillus moniliformis, Leptospira interrogans, and Seoul hantavirus. We also identified a wide range of known and novel viruses from groups that contain important human pathogens, including sapoviruses, cardioviruses, kobuviruses, parechoviruses, rotaviruses, and hepaciviruses. The two novel hepaciviruses discovered in this study replicate in the liver of Norway rats and may have utility in establishing a small animal model of human hepatitis C virus infection. The results of this study demonstrate the diversity of microbes carried by commensal rodent species and highlight the need for improved pathogen surveillance and disease monitoring in urban environments.IMPORTANCE The observation that most emerging infectious diseases of humans originate in animal reservoirs has led to wide-scale microbial surveillance and discovery programs in wildlife, particularly in the developing world. Strikingly, less attention has been focused on commensal animals like rats, despite their abundance in urban centers and close proximity to human populations. To begin to explore the zoonotic disease risk posed by urban rat populations, we trapped and surveyed Norway rats collected in New York City over a 1-year period. This analysis revealed a striking diversity of known pathogens and novel viruses in our study population, including multiple agents associated with acute gastroenteritis or febrile illnesses in people. Our findings indicate that urban rats are reservoirs for a vast diversity of microbes that may affect human health and indicate a need for increased surveillance and awareness of the disease risks associated with urban rodent infestation.\"'], ['Large-Scale Avian Influenza Surveillance in Wild Birds throughout the United States,\"By: Bevins, Sarah N.; Pedersen, Kerri; Lutman, Mark W.; et al.\",PLOS ONE  Volume: 9   Issue: 8     Article Number: e104360   Published: AUG 12 2014,\"Avian influenza is a viral disease that primarily infects wild and domestic birds, but it also can be transmitted to a variety of mammals. In 2006, the United States of America Departments of Agriculture and Interior designed a large-scale, interagency surveillance effort that sought to determine if highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses were present in wild bird populations within the United States of America. This program, combined with the Canadian and Mexican surveillance programs, represented the largest, coordinated wildlife disease surveillance program ever implemented. Here we analyze data from 197,885 samples that were collected from over 200 wild bird species. While the initial motivation for surveillance focused on highly pathogenic avian influenza, the scale of the data provided unprecedented information on the ecology of avian influenza viruses in the United States, avian influenza virus host associations, and avian influenza prevalence in wild birds over time. Ultimately, significant advances in our knowledge of avian influenza will depend on both large-scale surveillance efforts and on focused research studies.\"'], ['Comparative Host Feeding Patterns of the Asian Tiger Mosquito, Aedes albopictus, in Urban and Suburban Northeastern USA and Implications for Disease Transmission,\"By: Faraji, Ary; Egizi, Andrea; Fonseca, Dina M.; et al.\",PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES  Volume: 8   Issue: 8     Article Number: e3037   Published: AUG 2014,\"Background: Aedes albopictus is an invasive species which continues expanding its geographic range and involvement in mosquito-borne diseases such as chikungunya and dengue. Host selection patterns by invasive mosquitoes are critically important because they increase endemic disease transmission and drive outbreaks of exotic pathogens. Traditionally, Ae. albopictus has been characterized as an opportunistic feeder, primarily feeding on mammalian hosts but occasionally acquiring blood from avian sources as well. However, limited information is available on their feeding patterns in temperate regions of their expanded range. Because of the increasing expansion and abundance of Ae. albopictus and the escalating diagnoses of exotic pathogens in travelers returning from endemic areas, we investigated the host feeding patterns of this species in newly invaded areas to further shed light on its role in disease ecology and assess the public health threat of an exotic arbovirus outbreak.Methodology/Principal Findings: We identified the vertebrate source of 165 blood meals in Ae. albopictus collected between 2008 and 2011 from urban and suburban areas in northeastern USA. We used a network of Biogents Sentinel traps, which enhance Ae. albopictus capture counts, to conduct our collections of blooded mosquitoes. We also analyzed blooded Culex mosquitoes collected alongside Ae. albopictus in order to examine the composition of the community of blood sources. We found no evidence of bias since as expected Culex blood meals were predominantly from birds (n = 149, 93.7%) with only a small proportion feeding on mammals (n = 10, 6.3%). In contrast, Aedes albopictus fed exclusively on mammalian hosts with over 90% of their blood meals derived from humans (n = 96, 58.2%) and domesticated pets (n = 38, 23.0% cats; and n = 24, 14.6% dogs). Aedes albopictus fed from humans significantly more often in suburban than in urban areas (chi(2), p = 0.004) and cat-derived blood meals were greater in urban habitats (chi(2), p = 0.022). Avian-derived blood meals were not detected in any of the Ae. albopictus tested.Conclusions/Significance: The high mammalian affinity of Ae. albopictus suggests that this species will be an efficient vector of mammal-and human-driven zoonoses such as La Crosse, dengue, and chikungunya viruses. The lack of blood meals obtained from birds by Ae. albopictus suggest that this species may have limited exposure to endemic avian zoonoses such as St. Louis encephalitis and West Nile virus, which already circulate in the USA. However, growing populations of Ae. albopictus in major metropolitan urban and suburban centers, make a large autochthonous outbreak of an arbovirus such as chikungunya or dengue viruses a clear and present danger. Given the difficulties of Ae. albopictus suppression, we recommend that public health practitioners and policy makers install proactive measures for the imminent mitigation of an exotic pathogen outbreak.\"'], ['Is wild boar heading towards movement ecology? A review of trends and gaps,\"By: Morelle, Kevin; Lehaire, Francois; Lejeune, Philippe\",WILDLIFE BIOLOGY  Volume: 20   Issue: 4   Pages: 196-205   Published: AUG 2014,\"Studies about the movement of mammals have recently gained much emphasis thanks to the development of new tracking technology, allowing highly accurate recording of animal movement. However, the amount of data made available requires effective theoretical and analytical framework for appropriate scientific use, i.e. to answer questions of interest. Within this review, we used systematic reviewing technique and the movement ecology framework to assess current knowledge and gaps in wild boar Sus scrofa spatial behaviour, species of high economic, ecological and social interest. Specifically, we observed that the development of new tracking techniques (radio-telemetry and global positioning system) has promoted movement-related studies since the early 2000. However, the ecology of movement, i.e. the why, how, when and where exactly an individual is moving is rarely the focus of these studies, which instead lies in the consequences of wild boar movement, e. g. the spread of disease, seed dispersal or damage. Most of the current studies are thus concerned with the interaction between environmental factors and spatial behaviour of the species, while other components of movement, internal state, navigation, and motion capacity are seldom studied. Compared to others ungulates, we also observed that wild boar movement ecology is still poorly considered in the literature. This review highlights the need for more quantitative descriptions of movement and behavioural-based approaches relating wild boar movement to its internal, navigational, and motion capacities. We expect that facilitated access to tracking technologies, in terms of cost and miniaturization, along with current interest in movement ecology will greatly promote increased knowledge in wild boar spatial behaviour.\"'], ['Development of an Ex Vivo Porcine Lung Model for Studying Growth, Virulence, and Signaling of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,\"By: Harrison, Freya; Muruli, Aneesha; Higgins, Steven; et al.\",INFECTION AND IMMUNITY  Volume: 82   Issue: 8   Pages: 3312-3323   Published: AUG 2014,\"Research into chronic infection by bacterial pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, uses various in vitro and live host models. While these have increased our understanding of pathogen growth, virulence, and evolution, each model has certain limitations. In vitro models cannot recapitulate the complex spatial structure of host organs, while experiments on live hosts are limited in terms of sample size and infection duration for ethical reasons; live mammal models also require specialized facilities which are costly to run. To address this, we have developed an ex vivo pig lung (EVPL) model for quantifying Pseudomonas aeruginosa growth, quorum sensing (QS), virulence factor production, and tissue damage in an environment that mimics a chronically infected cystic fibrosis (CF) lung. In a first test of our model, we show that lasR mutants, which do not respond to 3-oxo-C-12-homoserine lactone (HSL)-mediated QS, exhibit reduced virulence factor production in EVPL. We also show that lasR mutants grow as well as or better than a corresponding wild-type strain in EVPL. lasR mutants frequently and repeatedly arise during chronic CF lung infection, but the evolutionary forces governing their appearance and spread are not clear. Our data are not consistent with the hypothesis that lasR mutants act as social \"\"cheats\"\" in the lung; rather, our results support the hypothesis that lasR mutants are more adapted to the lung environment. More generally, this model will facilitate improved studies of microbial disease, especially studies of how cells of the same and different species interact in polymicrobial infections in a spatially structured environment.\"'], ['Large-scale movements in European badgers: has the tail of the movement kernel been underestimated?,\"By: Byrne, Andrew W.; Quinn, John L.; O\\'Keeffe, James J.; et al.\",JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY  Volume: 83   Issue: 4   Pages: 991-1001   Published: JUL 2014,\"Characterizing patterns of animal movementis a major aimin population ecology, and yet doing so at an appropriate spatial scale remains a major challenge. Estimating the frequency and distances of movements is of particular importance when species are implicated in the transmission of zoonotic diseases. European badgers (Meles meles) areclassically viewed as exhibiting limited dispersal, and yet their movements bring them into conflict with farmers due to their potential to spread bovine tuberculosis in parts of their range.Considerable uncertainty surrounds themovement potential of badgers, and this may be related tothe spatial scale of previous empirical studies.We conducted a large-scale mark-recapture study (755km2; 2008-2012; 1935 capture events; 963 badgers) to investigate movement patterns in badgers, and undertook a comparative meta-analysis using published data from 15 European populations. The dispersal movement (1km) kernel followed an inverse power-law function, with a substantial tail\\' indicating the occurrence of rare long-distance dispersal attempts during the study period. The mean recorded distance from this distribution was 2 center dot 6km, the 95 percentile was 7 center dot 3km and the longest recorded was 22 center dot 1km. Dispersal frequency distributions were significantly different between genders; males dispersed more frequently than females, but females made proportionally more long-distance dispersal attempts than males. We used a subsampling approach to demonstrate that the appropriate minimum spatial scale to characterize badger movements in our study population was 80km2, substantially larger than many previous badger studies. Furthermore, the meta-analysis indicated a significant association between maximum movement distance and study area size, while controlling for population density. Maximum long-distance movements were often only recorded by chance beyond the boundaries of study areas. These findings suggest that the tail of the badger movement distribution is currently underestimated. The implications of this for understanding the spatial ecology of badger populations and for the design of disease intervention strategies are potentially significant.\"'], ['Relative importance of host environment, transmission potential and host phylogeny to the structure of parasite metacommunities,\"By: Dallas, Tad; Presley, Steven J.\",OIKOS  Volume: 123   Issue: 7   Pages: 866-874   Published: JUL 2014,\"Identification of mechanisms that shape parasite community and metacommunity structures have important implications to host health, disease transmission, and the understanding of community assembly in general. Using a long-term dataset on parasites from desert rodents, we examined the relative contributions of host traits that represent important aspects of parasite environment, transmission probability between host species, and host phylogeny to the structure of a parasite metacommunity as well as for taxonomically restricted parasite metacommunities (coccidians, ectoparasites and helminths). This was done using a combination of metacommunity analysis and variance partitioning based on canonical correspondence analysis. Coccidian and ectoparasite metacommunities did not exhibit coherent structure. In contrast, helminths and the full parasite metacommunity had Clementsian and quasi-Clementsian structure, respectively, indicating that parasite species distributions for these metacommunities were compartmentalized along a dominant gradient. Variance decomposition indicated that characteristics associated with the host environment consistently explained more variation than did host traits associated with transmission opportunities or host phylogeny, indicating that the host environment is primary in shaping parasite species distributions among host species. Moreover, the importance of different types of host traits in structuring parasite metacommunities was consistent among taxonomic groups (i.e. full metacommunity, coccidians, and helminths) despite manifest differences in emergent structures (i.e. Clementsian, quasi-Clementsian, and random) that arose in response to variation in host environment.\"'], ['Communities of microbial eukaryotes in the mammalian gut within the context of environmental eukaryotic diversity,\"By: Parfrey, Laura Wegener; Walters, William A.; Lauber, Christian L.; et al.\",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY  Volume: 5     Article Number: 298   Published: JUN 19 2014,\"Eukaryotic microbes (protists) residing in the vertebrate gut influence host health and disease, but their diversity and distribution in healthy hosts is poorly understood. Protists found in the gut are typically considered parasites, but many are commensal and some are beneficial. Further, the hygiene hypothesis predicts that association with our co-evolved microbial symbionts may be important to overall health. It is therefore imperative that we understand the normal diversity of our eukaryotic gut microbiota to test for such effects and avoid eliminating commensal organisms. We assembled a dataset of healthy individuals from two populations, one with traditional, agrarian lifestyles and a second with modern, westernized lifestyles, and characterized the human eukaryotic microbiota via high-throughput sequencing. To place the human gut microbiota within a broader context our dataset also includes gut samples from diverse mammals and samples from other aquatic and terrestrial environments. We curated the SILVA ribosomal database to reflect current knowledge of eukaryotic taxonomy and employ it as a phylogenetic framework to compare eukaryotic diversity across environment. We show that adults from the non-western population harbor a diverse community of protists, and diversity in the human gut is comparable to that in other mammals. However, the eukaryotic microbiota of the western population appears depauperate. The distribution of symbionts found in mammals reflects both host phylogeny and diet. Eukaryotic microbiota in the gut are less diverse and more patchily distributed than bacteria. More broadly, we show that eukaryotic communities in the gut are less diverse than in aquatic and terrestrial habitats, and few taxa are shared across habitat types, and diversity patterns of eukaryotes are correlated with those observed for bacteria. These results outline the distribution and diversity of microbial eukaryotic communities in the mammalian gut and across environments.\"'], ['Co-Infection of Blacklegged Ticks with Babesia microti and Borrelia burgdorferi Is Higher than Expected and Acquired from Small Mammal Hosts,\"By: Hersh, Michelle H.; Ostfeld, Richard S.; McHenry, Diana J.; et al.\",PLOS ONE  Volume: 9   Issue: 6     Article Number: e99348   Published: JUN 18 2014,\"Humans in the northeastern and midwestern United States are at increasing risk of acquiring tickborne diseases - not only Lyme disease, but also two emerging diseases, human granulocytic anaplasmosis and human babesiosis. Co-infection with two or more of these pathogens can increase the severity of health impacts. The risk of co-infection is intensified by the ecology of these three diseases because all three pathogens (Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia microti) are transmitted by the same vector, blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis), and are carried by many of the same reservoir hosts. The risk of exposure to multiple pathogens from a single tick bite and the sources of co-infected ticks are not well understood. In this study, we quantify the risk of co-infection by measuring infection prevalence in 4,368 questing nymphs throughout an endemic region for all three diseases (Dutchess County, NY) to determine if co-infections occur at frequencies other than predicted by independent assortment of pathogens. Further, we identify sources of co-infection by quantifying rates of co-infection on 3,275 larval ticks fed on known hosts. We find significant deviations of levels of co-infection in questing nymphs, most notably 83% more co-infection with Babesia microti and Borrelia burgdorferi than predicted by chance alone. Further, this pattern of increased co-infection was observed in larval ticks that fed on small mammal hosts, but not on meso-mammal, sciurid, or avian hosts. Co-infections involving A. phagocytophilum were less common, and fewer co-infections of A. phagocytophilum and B. microti than predicted by chance were observed in both questing nymphs and larvae fed on small mammals. Medical practitioners should be aware of the elevated risk of B. microti/B. burgdorferi co-infection.\"'], ['The reliability of observational approaches for detecting interspecific parasite interactions: comparison with experimental results,\"By: Fenton, Andy; Knowles, Sarah C. L.; Petchey, Owen L.; et al.\",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY  Volume: 44   Issue: 7   Pages: 437-445   Published: JUN 2014,\"Interactions among coinfecting parasites have the potential to alter host susceptibility to infection, the progression of disease and the efficacy of disease control measures. It is therefore essential to be able to accurately infer the occurrence and direction of such interactions from parasitological data. Due to logistical constraints, perturbation experiments are rarely undertaken to directly detect interactions, therefore a variety of approaches are commonly used to infer them from patterns of parasite association in observational data. However, the reliability of these various approaches is not known. We assess the ability of a range of standard analytical approaches to detect known interactions between infections of nematodes and intestinal coccidia (Eimeria) in natural small-mammal populations, as revealed by experimental perturbations. We show that correlation-based approaches are highly unreliable, often predicting strong and highly significant associations between nematodes and Eimeria in the opposite direction to the underlying interaction. The most reliable methods involved longitudinal analyses, in which the nematode infection status of individuals at one month is related to the infection status by Eimeria the next month. Even then, however, we suggest these approaches are only viable for certain types of infections and datasets. Overall we suggest that, in the absence of experimental approaches, careful consideration be given to the choice of statistical approach when attempting to infer interspecific interactions from observational data.

The kultarr is the only species within its genus and is morphologically unique from other dasyurids. Like many Australian marsupials, the kultarr has undergone significant population declines and although it is listed as \"\"least concern\"\" on the IUCN red list little is known of their ecology in the wild. A lack of knowledge on their biology can be attributed to their cryptic nature and sparse population densities. Recent studies of kultarrs have increased knowledge of the biology and captive management, with current data predominately coming from captive colonies. Captive studies of the kultarr have provided data on reproduction, diet choice, nutrition, health, and disease. Kultarrs are polyestrous seasonal breeders and are believed to be mostly insectivorous. Diseases noted in captive individuals provide some insight into those that may influence animals in the wild. Further research is required on both wild and captive populations to increase the knowledge base and determine appropriate management techniques for both wild and captive populations.

However, the oldest known association between a zoonotic virus and a bat is that between rabies virus and the vampire bat. Vampire bats are only found in Latin America and their unique method of obtaining nutrition, blood-feeding or haematophagy, has only evolved in the New World. The adaptations that enable blood-feeding also make the vampire bat highly effective at transmitting rabies virus. Whether the virus was present in pre-Columbian America or was introduced is much disputed, however, the introduction of Old World livestock and associated landscape modification, which continues to the present day, has enabled vampire bat populations to increase. This in turn has provided the conditions for rabies re-emergence to threaten both livestock and human populations as vampire bats target large mammals.

However, little is known about the prevalence of the disease in wild animals. A total of 632 samples obtained from 150 Japanese black bears, 142 Japanese hares, 120 small rodents, 97 rats, 53 raptors, 26 Japanese monkeys, 21 Japanese raccoon dogs, 20 masked palm civets, and three Japanese red foxes between 2002 and 2010 were investigated for the presence of antibodies to F. tularensis by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) and the commonly used microagglutination (MA) test. Seropositive cELISA and MA results were obtained in 23 and 18 Japanese black bears, three and two Japanese raccoon dogs, and two and one small rodents, respectively. All MA-positive samples (n = 21) were also positive by cELISA. Six of seven samples that were only positive by cELISA were confirmed to be antibody-positive by western blot analysis. These findings suggest that cELISA is a highly sensitive and useful test for serosurveillance of tularemia among various species of wild animals. Because this is the first study to detect F. tularensis-seropositive Japanese raccoon dogs, these could join Japanese black bears as sentinel animals for tularemia in the wild in Japan. Further continuous serosurveillance for F. tularensis in various species of wild animals using appropriate methods such as cELISA is important to assess the risks of human exposure and to improve our understanding of the ecology of F. tularensis in the wild.\"'], ['Increasing Group Size Alters Behavior of a Folivorous Primate,\"By: Gogarten, Jan F.; Bonnell, Tyler R.; Brown, Leone M.; et al.\",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY  Volume: 35   Issue: 2   Pages: 590-608   Published: APR 2014,\"Group size influences many aspects of mammalian social life, including stress levels, disease transmission, reproductive rates, and behavior. However, much of what is known about the effects of group size on behavioral ecology has come from comparisons across multiple groups of different sizes. These findings may be biased because behavioral differences across groups may be more indicative of how environmental variation influences animal behavior, rather than group size itself. To partially circumvent this limitation, we used longitudinal data to examine how changes in group size across time affect the behavior of folivorous red colobus monkeys (Procolobus rufomitratus) of Kibale National Park, Uganda. Controlling for food availability, we demonstrated that increasing group size resulted in altered activity budgets, based on 6 yr of data on a group that increased from 57 to 98 members. Specifically, as group size increased, individuals spent less time feeding and socializing, more time traveling, and increased the diversity of their diet. These changes appear to allow the monkeys to compensate for greater scramble competition apparent at larger group sizes, as increasing group size did not show the predicted relationship with lower female fecundity. Our results support recent findings documenting feeding competition in folivorous primates. Our results also document behavioral flexibility, an important trait that allows many social mammals to maximize the benefits of sociality (e.g., increased vigilance), while minimizing the costs (e.g., increased feeding competition).\"'], ['Mycobacterium ulcerans Persistence at a Village Water Source of Buruli Ulcer Patients,\"By: Bratschi, Martin W.; Ruf, Marie-Therese; Andreoli, Arianna; et al.\",PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES  Volume: 8   Issue: 3     Article Number: e2756   Published: MAR 2014,\"Buruli ulcer (BU), a neglected tropical disease of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, is caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans and is the third most common mycobacterial disease after tuberculosis and leprosy. While there is a strong association of the occurrence of the disease with stagnant or slow flowing water bodies, the exact mode of transmission of BU is not clear. M. ulcerans has emerged from the environmental fish pathogen M. marinum by acquisition of a virulence plasmid encoding the enzymes required for the production of the cytotoxic macrolide toxin mycolactone, which is a key factor in the pathogenesis of BU. Comparative genomic studies have further shown extensive pseudogene formation and downsizing of the M. ulcerans genome, indicative for an adaptation to a more stable ecological niche. This has raised the question whether this pathogen is still present in water-associated environmental reservoirs. Here we show persistence of M. ulcerans specific DNA sequences over a period of more than two years at a water contact location of BU patients in an endemic village of Cameroon. At defined positions in a shallow water hole used by the villagers for washing and bathing, detritus remained consistently positive for M. ulcerans DNA. The observed mean real-time PCR Ct difference of 1.45 between the insertion sequences IS2606 and IS2404 indicated that lineage 3 M. ulcerans, which cause human disease, persisted in this environment after successful treatment of all local patients. Underwater decaying organic matter may therefore represent a reservoir of M. ulcerans for direct infection of skin lesions or vector-associated transmission.\"'], ['Contrasting Patterns in Mammal-Bacteria Coevolution: Bartonella and Leptospira in Bats and Rodents,\"By: Lei, Bonnie R.; Olival, Kevin J.\",PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES  Volume: 8   Issue: 3     Article Number: e2738   Published: MAR 2014,\"Background: Emerging bacterial zoonoses in bats and rodents remain relatively understudied. We conduct the first comparative host-pathogen coevolutionary analyses of bacterial pathogens in these hosts, using Bartonella spp. and Leptospira spp. as a model.Methodology/Principal Findings: We used published genetic data for 51 Bartonella genotypes from 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella from 38 rodents, and 26 Leptospira from 20 bats. We generated maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies for hosts and bacteria, and tested for coevoutionary congruence using programs ParaFit, PACO, and Jane. Bartonella spp. and their bat hosts had a significant coevolutionary fit (ParaFitGlobal = 1.9703, P = 0.001; m(2) global value = 7.3320, P = 0.0001). Bartonella spp. and rodent hosts also indicated strong overall patterns of cospeciation (ParaFitGlobal = 102.4409, P = 0.001; m(2) global value = 86.532, P = 0.0001). In contrast, we were unable to reject independence of speciation events in Leptospira and bats (ParaFitGlobal = 0.0042, P = 0.84; m(2) global value = 4.6310, P = 0.5629). Separate analyses of New World and Old World data subsets yielded results congruent with analysis from entire datasets. We also conducted event-based cophylogeny analyses to reconstruct likely evolutionary histories for each group of pathogens and hosts. Leptospira and bats had the greatest number of host switches per parasite (0.731), while Bartonella and rodents had the fewest (0.264).Conclusions/Significance: In both bat and rodent hosts, Bartonella exhibits significant coevolution with minimal host switching, while Leptospira in bats lacks evolutionary congruence with its host and has high number of host switches. Reasons underlying these variable coevolutionary patterns in host range are likely due to differences in disease-specific transmission and host ecology.

The main objective of this study was to obtain information about the occurrence of F. tularensis in small mammals in Finland. We snap-trapped 547 wild small mammals representing 11 species at 14 locations around Finland during 6 years and screened them for the presence of F. tularensis DNA using PCR analysis. High copy number of F. tularensis-specific DNA was detected in tissue samples of five field voles (Microtus agrestis) originating from one location and 2 years. According to DNA sequences of the bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA gene amplified from F. tularensis-infected voles, the infecting agent belongs to the subspecies holarctica. To find out the optimal tissue for tularemia screening in voles, we compared the amounts of F. tularensis DNA in lungs, liver, spleen, and kidney of the infected animals. F. tularensis DNA was detectable in high levels in all four organs except for one animal, whose kidney was F. tularensis DNA-negative. Thus, at least liver, lung, and spleen seem suitable for F. tularensis screening in voles. Thus, liver, lung, and spleen all seem suitable for F. tularensis screening in voles. In conclusion, field voles can be heavily infected with F. tularensis subsp. holarctica and thus potentially serve as the source of infection in humans and other mammals.\"'], ['Length of intervals between epidemics: evaluating the influence of maternal transfer of immunity,\"By: Garnier, Romain; Gandon, Sylvain; Harding, Karin C.; et al.\",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION  Volume: 4   Issue: 5   Pages: 568-575   Published: MAR 2014,\"The length of intervals between epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases is critical in epidemiology. In several species of marine mammals and birds, it is pivotal to also consider the life history of the species of concern, as the contact rate between individuals can have a seasonal flux, for example, due to aggregations during the breeding season. Recently, particular interest has been given to the role of the dynamics of immunity in determining the intervals between epidemics in wild animal populations. One potentially powerful, but often neglected, process in this context is the maternal transfer of immunity. Here, we explore theoretically how the transfer of maternal antibodies can delay the recurrence of epidemics using Phocine Distemper in harbor seals as an example of a system in which epidemic outbreaks are followed by pathogen extinction. We show that the presence of temporarily protected newborns can significantly increase the predicted interval between epidemics, and this effect is strongly dependent on the degree of synchrony in the breeding season. Furthermore, we found that stochasticity in the onset of epidemics in combination with maternally acquired immunity increases the predicted intervals between epidemics even more. These effects arise because newborns with maternal antibodies temporarily boost population level immunity above the threshold of herd immunity, particularly when breeding is synchronous. Overall, our results show that maternal antibodies can have a profound influence on the dynamics of wildlife epidemics, notably in gregarious species such as many marine mammals and seabirds.\"'], ['Trypanosome species in neo-tropical bats: Biological, evolutionary and epidemiological implications,\"By: David Ramirez, Juan; Tapia-Calle, Gabriela; Munoz-Cruz, Geissler; et al.\",INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION  Volume: 22   Pages: 250-256   Published: MAR 2014,\"Bats (Chiroptera) are the only mammals naturally able to fly. Due to this characteristic they play a relevant ecological role in the niches they inhabit. These mammals spread infectious diseases from enzootic to domestic foci. Rabbies, SARS, fungi, ebola and trypanosomes are the most common pathogens these animals may host. We conducted intensive sampling of bats from the phyllostomidae, vespertilionidae and emballonuridae families in six localities from Casanare department in eastern Colombia. Blood-EDTA samples were obtained and subsequently submitted to analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers in order to conduct barcoding analyses to discriminate trypanosome species. The findings according to the congruence of the three molecular markers suggest the occurrence of Trypanosoma cruzi cruzi (51%), T. c. marinkellei (9%), T. dionisii (13%), T. rangeli (21%), T. evansi (4%) and T. theileri (2%) among 107 positive bat specimens. Regarding the T. cruzi DTUs, we observed the presence of TcI (60%), TcII (15%), TcIII (7%), TcIV (7%) and TcBAT (11%) being the first evidence to our concern of the foreseen genotype TcBAT in Colombia. These results allowed us to propose reliable hypotheses regarding the ecology and biology of the bats circulating in the area including the enigmatic question whether TcBAT should be considered a novel DTU.

We investigate how biodiversity affects the distribution of infectious diseases and their outbreaks in this region, taking into account socio-economics (population size, GDP, public health expenditure), geography (latitude and nation size), climate (precipitation, temperature) and biodiversity (bird and mammal species richness, forest cover, mammal and bird species at threat). We show, among countries, that the overall richness of infectious diseases is positively correlated with the richness of birds and mammals, but the number of zoonotic disease outbreaks is positively correlated with the number of threatened mammal and bird species and the number of vector-borne disease outbreaks is negatively correlated with forest cover. These results suggest that, among countries, biodiversity is a source of pathogens, but also that the loss of biodiversity or its regulation, as measured by forest cover or threatened species, seems to be associated with an increase in zoonotic and vector-borne disease outbreaks.\"'], ['Mitochondrial genomes of Anisakis simplex and Contracaecum osculatum (sensu stricto) - Comparisons with selected nematodes,\"By: Mohandas, Namitha; Jabbar, Abdul; Podolska, Magdalena; et al.\",INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION  Volume: 21   Pages: 452-462   Published: JAN 2014,\"Anisakid nematodes parasitize mainly fish, marine mammals and/or fish-eating birds, and can be transmitted to a range of fish-eating mammals, including humans, where they can cause gastrointestinal disease linked to larval infection or allergic responses. In spite of the animal and human health significance of these parasites, there are still gaps in our understanding of the systematics, biology, epidemiology and ecology of anisakids. Mitochondrial (mt) DNA provides useful genetic markers for investigations in these areas, but complete mt genomic data have been lacking for most anisakids. In the present study, the mt genomes of Anisakis simplex sensu stricto and Contracaecum osculatum sensu stricto were amplified from genomic DNA by long-range polymerase chain reaction and sequenced using 454 technology. The circular mt genomes of these species were 13,926 and 13,823 bp, respectively, and each of them contained 12 protein-coding, 22 transfer RNA, and 2 ribosomal RNA genes consistent for members of the Ascaridida, Oxyurida, Spirurida, Rhabditida and Strongylida. These mt genomes provide a stepping-stone for future comparative analyses of a range of anisakids and a basis for reinvestigating their genetic relationships. In addition, these markers might be used in prospecting for cryptic species and exploring host affiliations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of the current study was to contribute to the knowledge of the diseases caused by Y. pseudotuberculosis in goats, the animal species most frequently reported with clinical yersiniosis to the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System, to better understand the epidemiology of this disease. A 23-year retrospective study was conducted to characterize the syndromes caused by the bacterium in goats and their temporospatial distribution, and to determine the number of cases in other animal species.

Recent reviews summarized the mechanisms by which invasive species alter entire ecosystems, but quantitative assessments of these mechanisms are lacking for actual assemblages to determine their relative importance, frequency and patterns. We updated information on introduced vertebrates in the Tierra del Fuego Archipelago (TDF) via an exhaustive literature review and new data to evaluate ecosystem impact mechanisms and provide management recommendations. To date, 24 exotic vertebrates have naturalized in TDF, outnumbering natives nearly 2:1, with the North American beaver (Castor canadensis) and muskrat (Ondatra zibethica) being the most widely distributed species and also impacting the ecosystem through the greatest number of mechanisms. Introduced vertebrates occupied most parts of the archipelago with human-inhabited islands having greater taxa richness. All exotics potentially altered ecosystems by one or more mechanisms: 100% food webs, 92% invasional meltdown, 42% habitat modification, 38% disease or parasite transmission, 21% soil property and disturbance regime changes. Impact to habitat structure was the main clustering criterion for this assemblage. Within the species that physically alter habitats, we found two sub-groups: 1) large herbivores and 2) \"\"others\"\" including beavers and muskrats. Species that did not alter habitat were divided further into those with predatory trophic effects (carnivorous mammals and trout, sub-group 4) and the rest with assorted impacts (sub-group 3). By establishing high quality information on archipelago-wide assemblage, distribution, impacts and mechanisms for exotic vertebrates, we recommend, based on ecological criteria, prioritizing the management of sub-group 2. A secondary priority might be given to the carnivores in sub-group 4, while species in sub-groups 1 and 3 are less urgent. As the first systematic survey of introduced fauna on an archipelago-scale, we identified knowledge gaps, such as population abundance and dynamics for specific species, which are needed to orient future work, but the notable progress made to date is highlighted.

Although mosquito-borne diseases are ubiquitous in the Neotropics, few studies in this region have assessed patterns of mosquito-host interactions, especially during actual disease outbreaks. Based on collections made during and after an outbreak of equine viral encephalitis, we identified the source of 338 blood meals from 10 species of mosquitoes from Aruza Abajo, a location in Darien province in eastern Panama. A PCR based method targeting three distinct mitochondrial targets and subsequent DNA sequencing was used in an effort to delineate vector-host relationships. At Aruza Abajo, large domesticated mammals dominated the assemblage of mosquito blood meals while wild bird and mammal species represented only a small portion of the blood meal pool. Most mosquito species fed on a variety of hosts; foraging index analysis indicates that eight of nine mosquito species utilize hosts at similar proportions while a stochastic model suggests dietary overlap among species was greater than would be expected by chance. The results from our null-model analysis of mosquito diet overlap are consistent with the hypothesis that in landscapes where large domestic animals dominate the local biomass, many mosquito species show little host specificity, and feed upon hosts in proportion to their biomass, which may have implications for the role of livestocking patterns in vector-borne disease ecology.\"'], ['Intraseasonal variation in survival and probable causes of mortality in greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus,\"By: Blomberg, Erik J.; Gibson, Daniel; Sedinger, James S.; et al.\",WILDLIFE BIOLOGY  Volume: 19   Issue: 4   Pages: 347-357   Published: DEC 2013,\"The mortality process is a key component of avian population dynamics, and understanding factors that affect mortality is central to grouse conservation. Populations of greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus have declined across their range in western North America. We studied cause-specific mortality of radio-marked sage-grouse in Eureka County, Nevada, USA, during two seasons, nesting (2008-2012) and fall (2008-2010), when survival was known to be lower compared to other times of the year. We used known-fate and cumulative incidence function models to estimate weekly survival rates and cumulative risk of cause-specific mortalities, respectively. These methods allowed us to account for temporal variation in sample size and staggered entry of marked individuals into the sample to obtain robust estimates of survival and cause-specific mortality. We monitored 376 individual sage-grouse during the course of our study, and investigated 87 deaths. Predation was the major source of mortality, and accounted for 90% of all mortalities during our study. During the nesting season (1 April - 31 May), the cumulative risk of predation by raptors (0.10; 95% CI: 0.05-0.16) and mammals (0.08; 95% CI: 0.03-013) was relatively equal. In the fall (15 August - 31 October), the cumulative risk of mammal predation was greater (M-(mam) = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.04-0.19) than either predation by raptors (M-(rap) = 0.05; 95% CI: 0.00-0.10) or hunting harvest (M-(hunt) = 0.02; 95% CI: 0.0-0.06). During both seasons, we observed relatively few additional sources of mortality (e.g. collision) and observed no evidence of disease-related mortality (e.g. West Nile Virus). In general, we found little evidence for intraseasonal temporal variation in survival, suggesting that the nesting and fall seasons represent biologically meaningful time intervals with respect to sage-grouse survival.\"'], ['Coyotes, Red Foxes, and the Prevalence of Lyme Disease,\"By: Way, Jonathan G.; White, Bradley N.\",NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST  Volume: 20   Issue: 4   Pages: 655-665   Published: DEC 2013,\"Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in north temperate areas worldwide, with the majority of cases reported in the northeastern United States. The transmission cycle involves ticks, deer, small mammalian hosts such as mice, and numerous other species. Levi et al. (2012) suggested that Canis latrans (Coyote) abundance and Vulpes vulpes (Red Fox) scarcity are strong predictors of Lyme disease cases in eastern North America, with Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer) abundance being less important. This suggestion was based on correlations of disease dynamics with human harvests of canids, as it has been suggested that Red Foxes occur at a lower abundance because of Coyote predation. Because Red Foxes are more effective predators of small mammals, the authors of that work contend that the lower Red Fox abundance results in an increase in the incidence of Lyme disease. This paper re-examines the evidence used by Levi at al. (2012) to reach their conclusions. We address the following points: 1) Levi et al. did not provide data on rodent populations or Lyme disease incidence; 2) Coyotes eat rodents, so a Coyote-induced reduction of Red Fox populations might not result in increased rodent populations; 3) Coyote harvests are poor indicators of Coyote abundance; 4) both Red Fox numbers and rodent numbers fluctuate dramatically due to factors such as disease and weather; 5) some of the data used by Levi et al. (2012) were from regions with western Coyotes, while other data were from areas with hybrid eastern Coyotes, thus confounding the situation; and 6) Levi et al. did not consider important alternative hypotheses, such as habitat fragmentation and climate change. Additionally, the historical dynamics of the Lyme disease system are unknown given that Canis lupus lycaon (= Canis lycaon) (Eastern Wolf) and Urocyon cinereoargenteus (Gray Foxes) originally lived m most of the northeast, while Red Foxes and Coyotes were historically absent from most of the area. We suggest proceeding with caution before concluding that the presence of Coyotes (or the reduction of Red Foxes) is the primary cause of increased incidence of Lyme disease cases m the eastern United States.\"'], ['Retrospective molecular integrated epidemiology of Chagas disease in Colombia,\"By: Guhl, Felipe; David Ramirez, Juan\",INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION  Volume: 20   Pages: 148-154   Published: DEC 2013,\"American trypanosomiasis is a very complex zoonosis that is present throughout South America, Central America, and Mexico and continues to represent a serious threat to the health of countries in the region.

These DTUs show a wide range of geographical and host distributions. Our study aimed to establish the relationship between the genetic diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi and the diverse clinical manifestations of infected patients and unravel the molecular eco-epidemiology in the epizootic and enzootic scenarios in Colombia. We undertook intensive sampling in 17 departments of Colombia among 11 triatomine species, 9 mammalian reservoir species and humans and obtained 637 biological clones that were subsequently analyzed using nuclear and mitochondrial molecular markers. TcI was the most prevalent (80.7%) followed by TcII (7.2%), TcIII (3.9%), TcIV (5%), TcV (0.8%), TcVI (1.6%) and TcBat (0.8%).

When the composition of this microbiota is unfavorably altered, termed dysbiosis, the host is rendered more susceptible to a variety of chronic diseases. In the mammalian small intestine, specialized secretory epithelial cells, named Paneth cells, produce a variety of secreted antimicrobial peptides that fundamentally influence the composition of the microbiota. Recent investigations have identified numerous genetic and environmental factors that can disrupt normal Paneth cell function, resulting in compromised antimicrobial peptide secretion and consequent dysbiosis.

Though largely ignored to date, these coextinctions can pose threats to human health by altering the composition, quantity and distribution of zoonotic parasites. We simulated host extinctions from more than 1300 host-parasite associations for 29 North American carnivores to investigate changes in parasite composition and species richness. We also explored the geography of zoonotic parasite richness under three carnivore composition scenarios and examined corresponding levels of human exposure. We found that changes in parasite assemblages differed among parasite groups. Because viruses tend to be generalists, the proportion of parasites that are viruses increased as more carnivores went extinct. Coextinction of carnivore parasites is unlikely to be common, given that few specialist parasites exploit hosts of conservation concern. However, local extirpations of widespread carnivore hosts can reduce overall zoonotic richness and shift distributions of parasite-rich areas. How biodiversity influences disease risks remains the subject of debate. Our results make clear that hosts vary in their contribution to human health risks. As a consequence, so too does the loss (or gain) of particular hosts. Anticipating changes in host composition in future environments may help inform parasite conservation and disease mitigation efforts.\"'], ['Fecal Influenza in Mammals: Selection of Novel Variants,\"By: Kocer, Zeynep A.; Obenauer, John; Zaraket, Hassan; et al.\",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY  Volume: 87   Issue: 21   Pages: 11476-11486   Published: NOV 2013,\"In aquatic birds, influenza A viruses mainly replicate in the intestinal tract without significantly affecting the health of the host, but in mammals, they replicate in the respiratory tract and often cause disease. Occasionally, influenza viruses have been detected in stool samples of hospitalized patients and in rectal swabs of naturally or experimentally infected mammals. In this study, we compared the biological and molecular differences among four wild-type avian H1N1 influenza viruses and their corresponding fecal and lung isolates in DBA/2J and BALB/cJ mice. All fecal and lung isolates were more pathogenic than the original wild-type viruses, when inoculated into mice of both strains. The increased virulence was associated with the acquisition of genetic mutations. Most of the novel genotypes emerged as PB2(E627K), HA(F128V), HA(F454L), or HA(H300P) variations, and double mutations frequently occurred in the same isolate. However, influenza virus strain-and host-specific differences were also observed in terms of selected variants. The avian H1N1 virus of shorebird origin appeared to be unique in its ability to rapidly adapt to BALB/cJ mice via the fecal route, compared to the adaptability of the H1N1 virus of mallard origin. Furthermore, a bimodal distribution in fecal shedding was observed in mice infected with the fecal isolates, while a normal distribution was observed after infection with the lung isolates or wild-type virus. Fecal isolates contained HA mutations that increased the activation pH of the HA protein. We conclude that influenza virus variants that emerge in fecal isolates in mammals might influence viral transmission, adaptation to mammals, and viral ecology or evolution.\"'], ['Transmission ecosystems of Echinococcus multilocularis in China and Central Asia,\"By: Giraudoux, Patrick; Raoul, Francis; Afonso, Eve; et al.\",PARASITOLOGY  Volume: 140   Issue: 13   Special Issue: SI   Pages: 1655-1666   Published: NOV 2013,\"From continental to regional scales, the zoonosis alveolar echinococcosis (AE) (caused by Echinococcus multilocularis) forms discrete patches of endemicity within which transmission hotspots of much larger prevalence may occur.

Most rodents are considered keystone species in their ecological communities, hence the survival of many other species in the ecosystem depend on them. From medical point of view, this is particularly important for rodent-dependent pathogens. In the particular case of tick-borne diseases, rodents are important as hosts for vector ticks and as reservoir hosts (Lyme borreliosis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Tick-borne relapsing fevers, tick-borne rickettsioses, babesiosis). Community and population ecology of rodents was shown to be correlated with disease ecology in the case of many tick-borne diseases. In Eastern Europe, several adult hard-tick species use rodents as their principal hosts: Ixodes apronophorus, I. crenulatus, I. laguri, I. redikorzevi, I. trianguliceps. However, the majority of ticks feeding on rodents are immature stages of ticks which as adults are parasitic on larger mammals. Larvae and nymphs of Ixodes ricinus, the most abundant and medically important tick from Europe, are commonly found on rodents. This is particularly important, as many rodents are synanthropic and, together with other micromammals and birds are often the only available natural hosts for ticks in urban environments.

Baylisascaris procyonis, a parasitic roundworm with the ability to cause fatal central nervous system disease in many mammals, including humans, is a zoonotic threat, and research suggests that parasite recruitment rates by intermediate hosts are highly variable among forest patches in fragmented landscapes. During 2008, we sampled 353 white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) from 22 forest patches distributed throughout a fragmented agricultural ecosystem to determine the influence of landscape-level habitat attributes on infection rates of B. procyonis in mice. We characterized each mouse in terms of infection status and intensity of infection, and calculated (on a patch-wide basis) prevalence, mean abundance of B. procyonis, and mean intensity of infection. We used an information-theoretic approach to develop a suite of candidate models characterizing the influence of landscape attributes on each of our measured characteristics of B. procyonis infection in white-footed mice, based on previous knowledge of raccoon (Procyon lotor) ecology and B. procyonis distribution in agricultural ecosystems. We observed evidence of B. procyonis infection in mice across all 22 habitat patches sampled. However, parasite recruitment rates and intensity were highly variable among patches, and the results of our analyses suggest that spatial variability in B. procyonis infections was primarily driven by emergent properties of fragmented ecosystems. In particular, prevalence, abundance, and intensity of B. procyonis infections in mice were negatively associated with the size and connectivity of forest patches. These results support previous studies indicating that habitat fragmentation can alter the transmission dynamics of infectious disease, and suggest that factors below the scale of landscape, i.e., fine-scale habitat structure or demographic and behavioral attributes of intermediate and/or definitive hosts, also may be important for predicting patterns of B. procyonis infection in intermediate hosts.\"'], ['Genetic structure of Trypanosoma cruzi in Colombia revealed by a High-throughput Nuclear Multilocus Sequence Typing (nMLST) approach,\"By: David Ramirez, Juan; Tapia-Calle, Gabriela; Guhl, Felipe\",BMC GENETICS  Volume: 14     Article Number: UNSP 96   Published: SEP 30 2013,\"Background: Chagas disease is a systemic pathology caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. This parasite reveals remarkable genetic variability, evinced in six Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) named from T. cruzi I to T. cruzi VI (TcI to TcVI). Recently newly identified genotypes have emerged such as TcBat in Brazil, Colombia and Panama associated to anthropogenic bats. The genotype with the broadest geographical distribution is TcI, which has recently been associated to severe cardiomyopathies in Argentina and Colombia. Therefore, new studies unraveling the genetic structure and natural history of this DTU must be pursued.Results: We conducted a spatial and temporal analysis on 50 biological clones of T. cruzi I (TcI) isolated from humans with different clinical phenotypes, triatomine bugs and mammal reservoirs across three endemic regions for Chagas disease in Colombia. These clones were submitted to a nuclear Multilocus Sequence Typing (nMLST) analysis in order to elucidate its genetic diversity and clustering. After analyzing 13 nuclear housekeeping genes and obtaining a 5821 bp length alignment, we detected two robust genotypes within TcI henceforth named TcIDOM (associated to human infections) and a second cluster associated to peridomestic and sylvatic populations. Additionaly, we detected putative events of recombination and an intriguing lack of linkage disequilibrium.Conclusions: These findings reinforce the emergence of an enigmatic domestic T. cruzi genotype (TcIDOM), and demonstrates the high frequency of recombination at nuclear level across natural populations of T. cruzi. Therefore, the need to pursue studies focused on the diferential virulence profiles of TcI strains.

Temporal variation in the direct and indirect influence that hosts and parasites exert on each other is still poorly understood. However, variation in species\\' influence due to species and interactions turnover can have important consequences for host community dynamics and/or for parasite transmission dynamics, and eventually for the risk of zoonotic diseases.2. We used data on a network of small mammals and their ectoparasites surveyed over 6 years to test hypotheses exploring (i) the temporal variability in direct and indirect influences species exert on each other in a community, and (ii) the differences in temporal variability of direct/indirect influences between temporally persistent (TP) and temporally intermittent species.3. We modelled the temporal variation in (i) direct reciprocal influence between hosts and parasites (hosts providing resources to parasites and parasites exploiting the resources of hosts), using an asymmetry index, and (ii) indirect influence among species within a community (e. g. facilitation of parasite infestation by other parasites), using betweenness centrality. We also correlated asymmetry and centrality to examine the relationship between them.4. Network dynamics was determined by TP species but even those species had strong among-species heterogeneity in the temporal variation of the direct/indirect effects they exerted. In addition, there was a significant positive linear correlation between asymmetry and centrality.5. We conclude that the temporal dynamics of host-parasite interactions is driven by TP hosts. However, even within this group of persistent species, some exhibit large temporal variation, such that the functional roles they play (e. g. in promoting parasite transmission) change over time. In addition, parasites having a large negative impact on hosts are also those facilitating the spread of other parasites through the entire host community. Our results provide new insights into community dynamics and can be applied in the management of antagonistic networks aimed at preventing disease outbreaks.\"'], ['Survival and Causes of Mortality in a Northern Population of Western Gray Squirrels,\"By: Vander Haegen, W. Matthew; Orth, Gene R.; Linders, Mary J.\",JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT  Volume: 77   Issue: 6   Pages: 1249-1257   Published: AUG 2013,\"We studied survival of radio-marked western gray squirrels (Sciurus griseus) and quantified causes of mortality including incidence and severity of notoedric mange in south-central Washington, 1998-2005. We used known-fate models in Program MARK to explore alternative hypotheses on factors related to survival and correlation analysis to investigate parameters that might be related to incidence of mange. The best-supported models indicated that survival varied by year and by sex and that survival of males was lower during the breeding season compared to the non-breeding season. We found little support for differences in survival between juvenile (5-12 months old) and adult squirrels, or for winter severity or size of the acorn crop as significant influences on survival. We determined the likely proximate cause of death for 81 animals; 63% were killed by predators and 37% succumbed to disease, with most disease deaths attributed to mange. Mange was documented in the population during all years and occurred more frequently in animals captured in spring than in animals captured in fall. Counter to our predictions, occurrence of mange was not correlated with 2 measures of winter severity but was strongly correlated with mildness of the preceding winter (number of days with mean air temperature 0 degrees C). Sequential use of nests by individual squirrels during mild winters with temperatures conducive to survival of ephemeral, free-living mites may partially explain the periodic epizootics of notoedric mange in this western gray squirrel population. Continued deterioration of squirrel habitat through fragmentation will place additional stressors on the population and may compound the effects of mange on this threatened species.

Convenient methods are required for sampling human skin volatiles under field conditions. We experimentally compared four modern methods for sampling skin odours: solvent extraction, headspace solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME), and two new techniques not previously used for the study of mammal volatiles, contact SPME and dynamic headspace with a chromatoprobe design. These methods were tested and compared both on European subjects under laboratory conditions and on young African subjects under field conditions. All four methods permitted effective trapping of skin odours, including the major known human skin volatile compounds. In both laboratory and field experiments, contact SPME, in which the time of collection was restricted to 3 min, provided results very similar to those obtained with classical headspace SPME, a method that requires 45 min of collection. Chromatoprobe sampling also proved to be very sensitive, rapid and convenient for the collection of human-produced volatiles in natural settings. Both contact SPME and chromatoprobe design may considerably facilitate the study of human skin volatiles under field conditions, opening new possibilities for examining the olfactory cues mediating the host-seeking behaviour of mosquito vectors implicated in the transmission of major diseases.\"'], ['Multiple Strains of Coxiella burnetii are Present in the Environment of St. Paul Island, Alaska,\"By: Duncan, C.; Savage, K.; Williams, M.; et al.\",TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES  Volume: 60   Issue: 4   Pages: 345-350   Published: AUG 2013,\"In 2010, Coxiella burnetii was identified at a high prevalence in the placentas of Northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) collected at a single rookery on St. Paul Island Alaska; an area of the United States where the agent was not known to be present. As contamination was hypothesized as a potential cause of false positives, but nothing was known about environmental C.burnetii in the region, an environmental survey was conducted to look for the prevalence and distribution of the organism on the island. While environmental prevalence was low, two strains of the organism were identified using PCR targeting the COM1 and IS1111 genes. The two strains are consistent with the organism that has been increasingly identified in marine mammals as well as a strain type more commonly found in terrestrial environments and associated with disease in humans and terrestrial animals. Further work is needed to elucidate information regarding the ecology of this organism in this region, particularly in association with the coastal environment.\"'], ['Stability of within-host - parasite communities in a wild mammal system,\"By: Knowles, Sarah C.

Interactions among co-infecting parasites may have important consequences for disease severity, transmission and community-level responses to perturbations. However, our current view of parasite interactions in nature comes primarily from observational studies, which may be unreliable at detecting interactions. We performed a perturbation experiment in wild mice, by using an anthelminthic to suppress nematodes, and monitored the consequences for other parasite species. Overall, these parasite communities were remarkably stable to perturbation. Only one non-target parasite species responded to deworming, and this response was temporary: we found strong, but short-lived, increases in the abundance of Eimeria protozoa, which share an infection site with the dominant nematode species, suggesting local, dynamic competition. These results, providing a rare and clear experimental demonstration of interactions between helminths and co-infecting parasites in wild vertebrates, constitute an important step towards understanding the wider consequences of similar drug treatments in humans and animals.\"'], ['Immune Activity, Body Condition and Human-Associated Environmental Impacts in a Wild Marine Mammal,\"By: Brock, Patrick M.; Hall, Ailsa J.; Goodman, Simon J.; et al.\",PLOS ONE  Volume: 8   Issue: 6     Article Number: e67132   Published: JUN 28 2013,\"Within individuals, immunity may compete with other life history traits for resources, such as energy and protein, and the damage caused by immunopathology can sometimes outweigh the protective benefits that immune responses confer. However, our understanding of the costs of immunity in the wild and how they relate to the myriad energetic demands on free-ranging organisms is limited. The endangered Galapagos sea lion (Zalophus wollebaeki) is threatened simultaneously by disease from domestic animals and rapid changes in food availability driven by unpredictable environmental variation. We made use of this unique ecology to investigate the relationship between changes in immune activity and changes in body condition. We found that during the first three months of life, changes in antibody concentration were negatively correlated with changes in mass per unit length, skinfold thickness and serum albumin concentration, but only in a sea lion colony exposed to anthropogenic environmental impacts. It has previously been shown that changes in antibody concentration during early Galapagos sea lion development were higher in a colony exposed to anthropogenic environmental impacts than in a control colony. This study allows for the possibility that these relatively large changes in antibody concentration are associated with negative impacts on fitness through an effect on body condition. Our findings suggest that energy availability and the degree of plasticity in immune investment may influence disease risk in natural populations synergistically, through a trade-off between investment in immunity and resistance to starvation. The relative benefits of such investments may change quickly and unpredictably, which allows for the possibility that individuals fine-tune their investment strategies in response to changes in environmental conditions. In addition, our results suggest that anthropogenic environmental impacts may impose subtle energetic costs on individuals, which could contribute to population declines, especially in times of energy shortage.\"'], ['Networks of wildlife translocations in developing countries: an emerging conservation issue?,\"By: Goss, Jeremy R.; Cumming, Graeme S.\",FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT  Volume: 11   Issue: 5   Pages: 243-250   Published: JUN 2013,\"The recent expansion of the global wildlife trade, both within and between countries, has many potentially negative ecological impacts. Emerging economies, in particular, have a largely overlooked potential for rapid internal growth in this trade. An analysis of similar to 17 000 wildlife transportation permits - issued in South Africa primarily for commercial purposes by the Western Cape Province\\'s local government - provides insights into this trend. During the past decade, a total of 912 amphibian, bird, mammal, and reptile species were transported to and from locations in the province; 60% of translocated vertebrate species were non-native. Network analysis of the data indicated that the numbers of participants within local trade networks are increasing rapidly. Static and dynamic structural differences emerged between the networks for selected vertebrate Classes. Changes in density and degree were pronounced for mammal and reptile networks but were more constant for birds over the observed time period. All translocation networks exhibited \"\"small-world\"\", scale-free properties, which would facilitate the rapid propagation of negative influences through the system.\"'], ['Diversity of Bacillus cereus group strains is reflected in their broad range of pathogenicity and diverse ecological lifestyles,\"By: Ceuppens, Siele; Boon, Nico; Uyttendaele, Mieke\",FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY  Volume: 84   Issue: 3   Pages: 433-450   Published: JUN 2013,\"Bacillus cereus comprises a highly versatile group of bacteria, which are of particular interest because of their capacity to cause disease. Emetic food poisoning is caused by the toxin cereulide produced during the growth of emetic B.cereus in food, while diarrhoeal food poisoning is the result of enterotoxin production by viable vegetative B.cereus cells in the small intestine, probably in the mucus layer and/or attached to the host\\'s intestinal epithelium. The numbers of B.cereus causing disease are highly variable, depending on diverse factors linked to the host (age, diet, physiology and immunology), bacteria (cellular form, toxin genes and expression) and food (nutritional composition and meal characteristics). Bacillus cereus group strains show impressive ecological diversity, ranging from their saprophytic life cycle in soil to symbiotic (commensal and mutualistic) lifestyles near plant roots and in guts of insects and mammals to various pathogenic ones in diverse insect and mammalian hosts. During all these different ecological lifestyles, their toxins play important roles ranging from providing competitive advantages within microbial communities to inhibition of specific pathogenic organisms for their host and accomplishment of infections by damaging their host\\'s tissues.\"'], ['Distribution and ecology of small mammals in Albania,\"By: Rogozi, Elton; Bego, Ferdinand; Papa, Anna; et al.\",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH  Volume: 23   Issue: 3   Pages: 258-268   Published: JUN 1 2013,\"In order to gain an insight into the population dynamics and habitat preferences of rodents in Albania, small mammals were collected during 20062009 in various districts of the country.

We present a quantitative analysis to address the hypothesis that bats are unique in their propensity to host zoonotic viruses based on a comparison with rodents, another important host order. We found that bats indeed host more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, and we identified life-history and ecological factors that promote zoonotic viral richness. More zoonotic viruses are hosted by species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of other species in the same taxonomic order (sympatry). Specifically in bats, there was evidence for increased zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one young), greater longevity and more litters per year. Furthermore, our results point to a new hypothesis to explain in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per species: the stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses shared between bat species suggests that interspecific transmission is more prevalent among bats than among rodents. Although bats host more zoonotic viruses per species, the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the number of rodent species as bat species. Therefore, rodents should still be a serious concern as reservoirs of emerging viruses. These findings shed light on disease emergence and perpetuation mechanisms and may help lead to a predictive framework for identifying future emerging infectious virus reservoirs.\"'], ['Long-distance movements of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus),\"By: Norquay, Kaleigh J.

This has become especially urgent for bat species affected by white-nose syndrome, a new disease of hibernating bats associated with the fungus Geomyces destructans. We studied within- and between-season movements of individual little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) throughout a 337,540-km(2) study area in Manitoba and northwestern Ontario, Canada. Our objectives were to quantify proportions of male and female bats that relocated from hibernacula and/or summer roosts between years, proportions of males and females captured at swarms that hibernated at those sites versus other hibernacula, and distances traveled by males and females during relocation events. We predicted that bats would exhibit male-biased dispersal, with males significantly more likely to relocate and more likely to travel long distances during relocation events. Between 1989 and 2010, we recaptured 1,459 of 10,432 banded individuals. Seasonal movements from hibernacula and/or swarms to summer colonies ranged widely from 10 to 647 km. Consistent with previous studies we found high fidelity to summer colonies and hibernacula across years. However, some individuals switched sites between years and the median relocation distance was 315 km, with over 20% of individual movements exceeding 500 km. Surprisingly, we found that females were significantly more likely to relocate than males. Our data could help explain apparent jumps in the distribution of G. destructans, but more data on transmission of the fungus in the wild are needed.\"'], ['Investigation of Tularemia Outbreak after Natural Infection of Outdoor-Housed Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta) with Francisella tularensis,\"By: Sammak, Rebecca L.; Rejmanek, Daniel D.; Roth, Tara M.; et al.\",COMPARATIVE MEDICINE  Volume: 63   Issue: 2   Pages: 183-190   Published: APR 2013,\"In the summer and fall of 2010, a series of outdoor-housed rhesus macaques were diagnosed with tularemia. PCR analysis or positive culture confirmed 11 cases, and 9 additional animals with similar clinical signs responded to empiric antibiotic treatment. A serosurvey conducted in the 9 mo after the outbreak found 53% (43 of 81 macaques) seropositivity in the southern outdoor colony, which had an average population of 700 animals. A prospective survey of small mammal reservoirs and arthropod vectors was conducted during the late summer and fall of 2011. PCR analyses of tissues from all 135 mice, 18 ground squirrels, 1 rat, 3 raccoons, 2 cats, and 3 jackrabbits and their fleas were negative for DNA of Francisella tularensis. Conventional PCR evaluation of stored DNA from affected macaques identified the causative organism as F. tularensis subsp. holartica. DNA evaluated from historic cases of tularemia in nonhuman primates confirmed that the organism that infected the colony during the late 1980s likewise was F. tularensis subsp. holartica. The macaque tularemia epizootic of 2010 appears to have been an extreme example of the periodic resurgence of tularemia. No evidence of rodent disease was found in the immediate vicinity during the 2011 interepizootic period. The concurrent widespread seropositivity (53%) and low incidence of clinical disease (2.7%) in 2010 suggests that this strain of Francisella has low pathogenicity in macaques.\"'], ['The historical ecology of the large mammal populations of Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania, east Africa,\"By: Oates, Louise; Rees, Paul A.\",MAMMAL REVIEW  Volume: 43   Issue: 2   Pages: 124-141   Published: APR 2013,\"Ngorongoro Crater is an ecologically important protected area in Tanzania, east Africa. We review published and unpublished data on the crater\\'s large mammal community from the first recorded visit by a European in 1892 to 2010. Early estimates often exaggerated large herbivore numbers and regular scientific censuses have only been made since the 1960s. Since then, most large herbivore populations have declined, particularly wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus, which have been replaced by buffalo Syncerus caffer as the dominant herbivore in terms of biomass. The internationally important population of black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis has reduced from over 100 in the 1960s to around 30 in 2011. The lion Panthera leo population is genetically isolated, has declined since the 1960s and has consistently been held below carrying capacity. Buffalo and warthogs Phacochoerus aethiopicus are relatively recent colonizers. Wild dogs Lycaon pictus were present in the 1960s but are probably now absent. Small numbers of elephants Loxodonta africana use the crater floor and cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus appear to be intermittent visitors. Primary drivers of changes in herbivore populations are disease and vegetation change. Poaching has been implicated as the cause of decline in rhinoceros. Disease associated with anomalous weather conditions appears to be the main driver for population change in lions. Recent scientific research on the large mammal community has largely been focused on lions and rhinoceros. The output of research on other species has not increased since the 1960s. A wider dissemination of research on the crater\\'s mammal populations would help to secure its status as an important site for conservation in the eyes of the wider scientific and conservation community.\"'], ['Effect of blood meal digestion and DNA extraction protocol on the success of blood meal source determination in the malaria vector Anopheles atroparvus,\"By: Martinez-de la Puente, Josue; Ruiz, Santiago; Soriguer, Ramon; et al.\",MALARIA JOURNAL  Volume: 12     Article Number: 109   Published: MAR 21 2013,\"Background: Host identification is an essential step in studies on the transmission dynamics of vector-borne disease. Nowadays, molecular tools allow the identification of vertebrate hosts to the species level. However, the proportion of successful identifications is variable and may be affected by the quality of the samples and the laboratory protocols. Here, the effect of two of these factors, namely the digestion status of mosquito blood meal and the DNA extraction procedure, on the success of host identification by amplification and sequencing of a fragment of the cytochrome oxidase 1 gene were tested.Methods: Mosquitoes collected both outdoors and indoors during 2012 in southern Spain were identified to species level and their blood meal digestion status recorded using the Sella score, a visual estimation of the digestion status of mosquito blood meals. Each mosquito was assigned randomly to one of two DNA extraction procedures: the quick and cheap HotSHOT procedure or the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue (R) kit and their hosts identified by a molecular method.Results: Three hundred and forty-seven blood-fed mosquitoes belonging to Anopheles atroparvus (n=171), Culex perexiguus (n=84), Culex pipiens (n=43), Culex theileri (n=39), Culex modestus (n=5), Ochlerotatus caspius (n=4), Culiseta sp. (n=1) were included in this study. Overall, hosts were identified from 234 blood meals compromising at least 25 species including mammals, birds and a single reptile. The success of host identification was lower in mosquitoes with an advanced stage of blood meal digestion and for blood meals extracted using the HotSHOT procedure.Conclusions: The success of host identification decreases with the advanced stage of mosquito blood meal digestion, from 84.5% for recent blood meals to 25.0% for more digested ones. Using the QIAGEN kit, the identification success improved by 17.6%, with larger increases at more advanced stages of blood meal digestion. Availability of blood-fed females used to be very limited for studies of vector ecology, and these results may help to increase the efficiency of blood meal analyses. In addition, results obtained in this study clearly support that the potential malaria vector An. atroparvus feeds on animals located outdoors but use human-made shelters for resting after feeding.\"'], ['Necrophobic behavior in small mammals,\"By: Prounis, George S.; Shields, William M.\",BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES  Volume: 94   Pages: 41-44   Published: MAR 2013,\"Necrophobic behaviors, defined as the avoidance of dead or injured conspecifics, have been formally documented in insects and aquatic organisms. It is plausible that such avoidance has been selected for by the risks of predation and disease that are associated with the presence of cadavers, and that necrophobic behaviors may be present across a variety of taxa. We demonstrate the avoidance of a house mouse (Mus musculus) cadaver by small mammals visiting experimental food trays, and by male and female house mice in a Y-maze exploration paradigm. In addition, we present individual differences in the responses of house mice to a house mouse cadaver. Further, we propose potential applications for the study of necrophobic behavior in improving wildlife management practices and models in disease ecology.

Its life-cycle includes more than 40 species of small mammal intermediate hosts. Therefore, host biodiversity losses could be expected to alter transmission. Climate may also have possible impacts on E. multilocularis egg survival. We examined the distribution of human AE across two spatial scales, (i) for continental China and (ii) over the eastern edge of the Tibetan plateau. We tested the hypotheses that human disease distribution can be explained by either the biodiversity of small mammal intermediate host species, or by environmental factors such as climate or landscape characteristics.Methodology/findings: The distributions of 274 small mammal species were mapped to 967 point locations on a grid covering continental China. Land cover, elevation, monthly rainfall and temperature were mapped using remotely sensed imagery and compared to the distribution of human AE disease at continental scale and over the eastern Tibetan plateau. Infection status of 17,589 people screened by abdominal ultrasound in 2002-2008 in 94 villages of Tibetan areas of western Sichuan and Qinghai provinces was analyzed using generalized additive mixed models and related to epidemiological and environmental covariates. We found that human AE was not directly correlated with small mammal reservoir host species richness, but rather was spatially correlated with landscape features and climate which could confirm and predict human disease hotspots over a 200,000 km(2) region.Conclusions/Significance: E. multilocularis transmission and resultant human disease risk was better predicted from landscape features that could support increases of small mammal host species prone to population outbreaks, rather than host species richness. We anticipate that our study may be a starting point for further research wherein landscape management could be used to predict human disease risk and for controlling this zoonotic helminthic.\"'], ['No need for disease: testing extinction hypotheses for the thylacine using multi-species metamodels,\"By: Prowse, Thomas A.

However, conventional PVA neglects important biotic interactions and therefore can fail to identify important threatening processes. We designed a new PVA approach that includes species interactions explicitly by networking species models within a single metamodel\\'. We demonstrate the utility of PVA metamodels by employing them to reinterpret the extinction of the carnivorous, marsupial thylacine Thylacinus cynocephalus in Tasmania. In particular, we test the claim that well-documented impacts of European settlement cannot account for this extinction and that an unknown disease must have been an additional and necessary cause. We first constructed a classical, single-species PVA model for thylacines, which was then extended by incorporation within a dynamic predatorherbivorevegetation metamodel that accounted for the influence of Europeans on the thylacine\\'s prey base. Given obvious parameter uncertainties, we explored both modelling approaches with rigorous sensitivity analyses. Single-species PVA models were unable to recreate the thylacine\\'s extinction unless a high human harvest, small starting population size or low maximum population growth rate was assumed, even if disease effects were included from 1906 to 1909. In contrast, we readily recreated the thylacine\\'s demise using disease-free multi-species metamodels that simulated declines in native prey populations (particularly due to competition with introduced sheep). Dynamic, multi-species metamodels provide a simple, flexible framework for studying current species declines and historical extinctions caused by complex, interacting factors.\"'], ['Comparison of two mammalian surveys made with camera traps in southeastern Brazil, focusing the abundance of wild mammals and domestic dogs,\"By: Carvalho, W.

It is also possible to assess the accuracy of different sampling methods, especially when the sampling effort is similar. The present study aimed at comparing two mammalian surveys carried out over a three-year interval, in terms of sampling effort, capture success, abundance of domestic dogs, impact of human activities, and relative biomass using camera traps, in the Serra do Japi Biological Reserve and surroundings, located in Jundiai, state of Sao Paulo, southeastern Brazil. The total richness recorded was 13 species, one domestic and 12 wild mammals. Sampling effort in both surveys was similar, but capture success and number of captures differed. The abundance of wild mammals and dogs did also differ between surveys. There was a highly significant correlation between abundance of wild mammals and capture effort for the survey performed in 2006/2007, but not for the survey performed in 2009/2010. The difference between samples may be related to human disturbance, since the number of domestic mammals photographed was higher in the second survey, three years after the first survey. Despite being a reserve, the area is still under pressure from urbanization, biological invasion, environmental degradation, and hunting, which may reduce the abundance of wild mammals.\"'], ['Henipaviruses: An Updated Review Focusing on the Pteropid Reservoir and Features of Transmission,\"By: Clayton, B.

Although previous studies demonstrated a link between social factors and the cellular immune system for captive mammals, it is yet poorly understood how ecological factors are connected with the different branches of the immune system in wild populations. Here, we tested how variation in aspects of the constitutive cellular and humoral immune system of free ranging bats is associated with two ecological factors that likely influence the putative risk of species to become infected by parasites and pathogens: diet and shelter. We found that white blood cell counts of 24 syntopic Neotropical bat species varied with the species\\' diet and body mass. Bats that included at least partially vertebrates in their diet exhibited the highest white blood cell counts, followed by phytophagous and insectivorous species, which is in agreement with the assumption that the immune system varies with the pathogen transmission risk of a trophic level. The soluble part of the constitutive immune response, assessed by an in vitro bacterial killing assay, decreased with increasing roost permanence. Our results suggest that the ecology is an important factor in the evolution of the immune system in bats and probably also other mammals.\"'], ['MULTIPLE FACTORS AFFECT A POPULATION OF AGASSIZ\\'S DESERT TORTOISE (GOPHERUS AGASSIZII) IN THE NORTHWESTERN MOJAVE DESERT,\"By: Berry, Kristin H.; Yee, Julie L.; Coble, Ashley A.; et al.\",HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS  Volume: 27   Pages: 87-109   Published: 2013,\"Numerous factors have contributed to declines in populations of the federally threatened Agassiz\\'s Desert Tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) and continue to limit recovery. In 2010, we surveyed a low-density population on a military test facility in the northwestern Mojave Desert of California, USA, to evaluate population status and identify potential factors contributing to distribution and low densities. Estimated densities of live tortoises ranged spatially from 1.2/km(2) to 15.1/km(2). Although only one death of a breeding-age tortoise was recorded for the 4-yr period prior to the survey, remains of 16 juvenile and immature tortoises were found, and most showed signs of predation by Common Ravens (Corvus corax) and mammals. Predation may have limited recruitment of young tortoises into the adult size classes. To evaluate the relative importance of different types of impacts to tortoises, we developed predictive models for spatially explicit densities of tortoise sign and live tortoises using topography (i.e., slope), predators (Common Raven, signs of mammalian predators), and anthropogenic impacts (distances from paved road and denuded areas, density of ordnance fragments) as covariates. Models suggest that densities of tortoise sign increased with slope and signs of mammalian predators and decreased with Common Ravens, while also varying based on interaction effects involving these predictors as well as distances from paved roads, denuded areas, and ordnance. Similarly, densities of live tortoises varied by interaction effects among distances to denuded areas and paved roads, density of ordnance fragments, and slope.

They fill an important ecological niche and have diversified into a wide range of habitats. In recent years, bats have been implicated as reservoirs for some of the most highly pathogenic emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases reported to date, including SARS-like coronavirus, Ebola, Hendra and Nipah viruses. The ability of bats to harbour these viruses in the absence of clinical signs of disease has resulted in a resurgence of interest in bat biology and virus-host interactions. Interest in bats, in Australia in particular, has intensified following the identification of several novel bat-borne viruses from flying-foxes, including Hendra virus, which is capable of spillover from bats to horses and subsequently to humans with potentially fatal consequences. As we continue to encroach on the natural habitats of bats, a better understanding of bat biology, ecology and virus-host interactions has never before been so critical. In this review, we focus on the biology of Australian pteropid bats and the pathogens they harbour, summarising current knowledge of bat-borne diseases, bat ecology, ethology and immunology.\"'], ['USING CAMERA - TRAP DATA TO MODEL HABITAT USE BY WOMBATS AND CATTLE IN AUSTRALIAN RIPARIAN ECOSYSTEMS,\"By: Borchard, P.\",APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH  Volume: 11   Issue: 1   Pages: 21-33   Published: 2013,\"Common Wombats (Vombatus ursinus) are an enigmatic south east Australian agricultural riparian species which may improve riparian landscape heterogeneity via their burrowing activity. At the same time they are often accused of causing soil erosion. As populations of wombats in other landscapes are under threat due to habitat disturbance, road mortality and disease, knowledge of the factors determining their distribution and abundance are important for their conservation and management. Since the European colonization of Australia, riparian areas have been utilized by domestic cattle (Bos taurus) usually resulting in a decline in biodiversity. Camera trap data was used to investigate the habitat use by wombats and cattle in Eastern Riverine Forests. The relationship between camera trapping and ecological and meteorological variables was investigated using logistic regression modelling. Wombats and cattle were the most common mammals recorded across all sites with 468 photographs of wombats and 106 of cattle recorded. The meteorological and ecological variables that had a significant effect on the observation of a wombat or a cow were time of day, humidity, lower storey canopy cover and the summer season.

Subsistence hunting and gathering activities may place rural residents of Alaska at a greater risk of acquiring zoonotic infections than urban residents. Known zoonotic diseases that occur in Alaska include brucellosis, toxoplasmosis, trichinellosis, giardiasis/cryptosporidiosis, echinococcosis, rabies and tularemia. Actions for early disease detection, research and prevention and control include: (1) determining baseline levels of infection and disease in both humans and host animals; (2) conducting more research to understand the ecology of infection in the Arctic environment; (3) improving active and passive surveillance systems for infection and disease in humans and animals; (4) improving outreach, education and communication on climate-sensitive infectious diseases at the community, health and animal care provider levels; and (5) improving coordination between public health and animal health agencies, universities and tribal health organisations.\"'], ['Biology of Phlebotomine Sand Flies as Vectors of Disease Agents,\"By: Ready, Paul D.\",\"Edited by: Berenbaum, MR\",\"Phlebotomines are the sole or principal vectors of Leishmania, Bartonella bacilliformis, and some arboviruses.

Evolutionary hypotheses are unresolved, so a practical phlebotomine classification is proposed to aid biomedical information retrieval. The vectors of Leishmania are tabulated and new criteria for their incrimination are given. Research on fly-parasite-host interactions, fly saliva, and behavioral ecology is reviewed in relation to parasite manipulation of blood feeding, vaccine targets, and pheromones for lures. Much basic research is based on few transmission cycles, so generalizations should be made with caution. Integrated research and control programs have begun, but improved control of leishmaniasis and nuisance-biting requires greater emphasis on population genetics and transmission modeling.

The oriental eyeworm, Thelazia callipaeda, infects a range of mammalian definitive hosts, including canids, felids and humans. Although this zoonotic parasite is of socio-economic significance in Asian countries, its genetics, epidemiology and biology are poorly understood. Mitochondrial (mt) DNA is known to provide useful genetic markers to underpin fundamental investigations, but no mt genome had been characterized for any members of the family Thelaziidae. In the present study, we sequenced and characterized the mt genome of T. callipaeda. This AT-rich (74.6%) mt genome (13,668 bp) is circular and contains 12 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and two ribosomal RNA genes, but lacks an atp8 gene.

The main vector of A. phagocytophilum in the United States is the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis (Say)) and various small and medium-sized mammals are reservoirs. Previous studies indicate that birds are exposed to A. phagocytophilum; however, because no studies have directly investigated avian susceptibility, reservoir competence, and morbidity for A. phagocytophilum, uncertainty remains as to what role birds could play in its transmission ecology. In a controlled laboratory study, we tested whether two species, the American robin (Turdus migratorius (L.)) and the gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis (L.)), can become infected with and then transmit A. phagocytophilum to feeding ticks, and whether exposed birds develop disease. Wild caught, seronegative birds (n = 10 per species) were exposed to A. phagocytophilum-infected I. scapularis nymphs (day 0). Transmission was assessed by xenodiagnosis on days 7, 14, 42, and 77; blood was assayed for bacteremia and serology. A. phagocytophilum was detected using quantitative polymerase chain reaction targeting the 16s rRNA gene. One robin infected 2 of 13 larval ticks (15%) on day 7; no other birds were found to infect feeding ticks at any time. Birds did not develop bacteremia, specific antibodies or significant illness because of exposure. Mouse controls became bacteremic, infected feeding ticks, and seroconverted. Our results suggest that these two avian species are unlikely to play a significant role in the maintenance of the agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis and that avian serosurveys may not be a reliable indicator of A. phagocytophilum exposure.\"'], ['Evolution of the MHC-DQB exon 2 in marine and terrestrial mammals,\"By: Jose Villanueva-Noriega, Maria; Baker, Charles Scott; Medrano-Gonzalez, Luis\",IMMUNOGENETICS  Volume: 65   Issue: 1   Pages: 47-61   Published: JAN 2013,\"On the basis of a general low polymorphism, several studies suggest that balancing selection in the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is weaker in marine mammals as compared with terrestrial mammals. We investigated such differential selection among Cetacea, Artiodactyla, and Primates at exon 2 of MHC-DQB gene by contrasting indicators of molecular evolution such as occurrence of transpecific polymorphisms, patterns of phylogenetic branch lengths by codon position, rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions as well as accumulation of variable sites on the sampling of alleles. These indicators were compared between the DQB and the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (cytb) as a reference of neutral expectations and differences between molecular clocks resulting from life history and historical demography. All indicators showed that the influence of balancing selection on the DQB is more variable and overall weaker for cetaceans. In our sampling, ziphiids, the sperm whale, monodontids and the finless porpoise formed a group with lower DQB polymorphism, while mysticetes exhibited a higher DQB variation similar to that of terrestrial mammals as well as higher occurrence of transpecific polymorphisms. Different dolphins appeared in the two groups. Larger variation of selection on the cetacean DQB could be related to greater stochasticity in their historical demography and thus, to a greater complexity of the general ecology and disease processes of these animals.\"'], ['Global distribution and genetic diversity of Bartonella in bat flies (Hippoboscoidea, Streblidae, Nycteribiidae),\"By: Morse, Solon F.; Olival, Kevin J.; Kosoy, Michael; et al.\",INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION  Volume: 12   Issue: 8   Pages: 1717-1723   Published: DEC 2012,\"Recently, a growing number Bartonella spp. have been identified as causative agents for a broadening spectrum of zoonotic diseases, emphasizing their medical importance. Many mammalian reservoirs and vectors however are still unknown, hindering our understanding of pathogen ecology and obscuring epidemiological connections.New Bartonella genotypes were detected in a global sampling of 19 species of blood-feeding bat flies (Diptera. Hippoboscoidea, Nycteribiidae, Streblidae) from 20 host bat species, suggesting an important role of bat flies in harboring bartonellae. Evolutionary relationships were explored in the context of currently known Bartonella species and genotypes. Phylogenetic and gene network analyses point to an early evolutionary association and subsequent radiation of bartonellae with bat flies and their hosts. The recovery of unique clades, uniting Bartonella genotypes from bat flies and bats, supports previous ideas of these flies potentially being vectors for Bartonella. Presence of bartonellae in some female bat flies and their pupae suggests vertical transmission across developmental stages. The specific function of bartonellae in bats and bat flies remains a subject of debate, but in addition to pathogenic interactions, parasitic, mutualistic, or reservoir functions need to be considered.

This paper confirms the zoonotic transfer of Staphylococcus aureus in a sanctuary setting. The assertion that this in itself is enough to reconsider the conservation potential of ape reintroduction provides an opportunity to discuss risk analysis of pathogen transmission, following IUCN guidelines, using S. aureus as an example. It is concluded that ape reintroduction projects must have disease risk mitigation strategies that include effective biosecurity protocols and pathogen surveillance. These strategies will assist with creating a well planned and executed reintroduction. This provides one way to enforce habitat protection, to minimise human encroachment and the risks from the illegal wildlife trade. Thus reintroduction must remain a useful tool in the conservation toolbox. Am. J. Primatol. 74:1076-1083, 2012.

Physiological assessment is important because vertebrates cope with unpredictable and noxious stimuli by initiating a stress response. However, an over-activation of the acute stress response by numerous novel and potentially stressful anthropogenic pressures, including those associated with urban edges, has the potential to generate chronic stress and a greater susceptibility to disease, reduce fecundity and survivorship. An individual\\'s physiological response to edge habitats with varying degrees of contrast to the adjacent disturbed urban matrix (e.g. major vs. minor roads), may provide insight into their survival likelihood in fragmented urban landscapes. Although demographic changes in wildlife resulting from urbanization have been documented, only recently have physiological consequences been examined. We addressed this problem using a case study of the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) in the fragmented urban landscape of southeast Queensland, Australia. Hair samples were used to enable a comparison of hair cortisol levels in individual squirrel gliders, providing an indication of potential stress. We applied a linear mixed-effect modeling approach clustered by patch to quantify the influence of site-level habitat factors and relative abundance comparative to edge contrast on hair cortisol levels. We found that edge type had a strong positive effect on hair cortisol levels; but this depended on the availability of abundant nest hollows at a site. We conclude that individual hair cortisol concentration, providing an index of stress, was lowest in interior habitats and highest in edge habitats adjacent to major roads. Furthermore, gliders occupying low edge contrast habitats adjacent to residential areas and minor roads, and containing abundant tree nest hollows, had low-moderate hair cortisol levels. This highlights the potential importance of these habitats for the conservation of arboreal mammals such as the squirrel glider in urban landscapes.\"'], ['Bioorganic Studies on the Key Natural Products from Venomous Mammals and Marine Invertebrates,\"By: Kita, Masaki\",BULLETIN OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN  Volume: 85   Issue: 11   Pages: 1175-1185   Published: NOV 15 2012,\"The discovery of new bioactive molecules, facilitated by a deeper understanding of nature, will advance our knowledge of biological processes and lead to new strategies to treat disease.

This account summarizes two recent aspects of bioorganic chemistry: mammalian venoms and antitumor marine macrolides. Due to the interesting ecology of venomous mammals, we examined the constituents of mammalian venom, and identified unique neurotoxic peptides and kallikrein-like proteases in shrews and platypus. The present findings may lead to the development of valuable vasoactive or pain-relief agents, and to a deeper understanding of the biological evolution of vertebrates in relation to toxic substances. We have also established the target proteins and mode of actions of aplyronine A, a potent antitumor and apoptogenic marine macrolide.

We performed transcriptome sequencing and annotation from lung, kidney and spleen tissues using 454 and Illumina platforms to develop this species as an animal model. More than 100,000 contigs were assembled, with 25,000 genes that were functionally annotated. Of the remaining unannotated contigs, 80% were found within bat genomes or transcriptomes.

Reciprocal BLAST best hits yielded 8,785 sequences that are orthologous to mouse, rat, cattle, horse and human. Species tree analysis of sequences from 2,378 loci was used to achieve 95% bootstrap support for the placement of bat as sister to the clade containing horse, dog, and cattle. Through substitution rate estimation between bat and human, 32 genes were identified with evidence for positive selection. We also identified 466 immune-related genes, which may be useful for studying Tacaribe virus infection of this species.

This group includes the different malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) that infect humans around the world. Our knowledge on the full life cycle of these parasites is most complete for those parasites that infect humans and, to some extent, birds. However, our current knowledge on haemosporidian life cycles is characterized by a paucity of information concerning the vector species responsible for their transmission among vertebrates. Moreover, our taxonomic and systematic knowledge of haemosporidians is far from complete, in particular because of insufficient sampling in wild vertebrates and in tropical regions. Detailed experimental studies to identify avian haemosporidian vectors are uncommon, with only a few published during the last 25 years. As such, little knowledge has accumulated on haemosporidian life cycles during the last three decades, hindering progress in ecology, evolution, and systematic studies of these avian parasites. Nonetheless, recently developed molecular tools have facilitated advances in haemosporidian research. DNA can now be extracted from vectors\\' blood meals and the vertebrate host identified; if the blood meal is infected by haemosporidians, the parasite\\'s genetic lineage can also be identified. While this molecular tool should help to identify putative vector species, detailed experimental studies on vector competence are still needed. Furthermore, molecular tools have helped to refine our knowledge on Haemosporida taxonomy and systematics. Herein we review studies conducted on Diptera vectors transmitting avian haemosporidians from the late 1800s to the present. We also review work on Haemosporida taxonomy and systematics since the first application of molecular techniques and provide recommendations and suggest future research directions.

For example, if a single pathogen were causing the death, decline and extinction of 30% of mammal species (including humans), the entire world would be paying attention. This is what has been happening to the world\\'s amphibians the frogs, toads and salamanders that are affected by the chytrid fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (referred to as Bd), which are consequently declining at an alarming rate. It has aptly been described as the worst pathogen in history in terms of its effects on biodiversity (Kilpatrick etal. 2010). The pathogen was only formally described about 13years ago (Longcore etal. 1999), and scientists are still in the process of determining where it came from and investigating the question: why now? Healthy debate has ensued as to whether Bd is a globally endemic organism that only recently started causing high mortality due to shifting host responses and/or environmental change (e.g. Pounds etal. 2006) or whether a virulent strain of the pathogen has rapidly disseminated around the world in recent decades, affecting new regions with a vengeance (e.g. Morehouse etal. 2003; Weldon etal. 2004; Lips etal. 2008). We are finally beginning to shed more light on this question, due to significant discoveries that have emerged as a result of intensive DNA-sequencing methods comparing Bd isolates from different amphibian species across the globe. Evidence is mounting that there is indeed a global panzootic lineage of Bd (BdGPL) in addition to what appear to be more localized endemic strains (Fisher etal. 2009; James etal. 2009; Farrer etal. 2011). Additionally, BdGPL appears to be a hypervirulent strain that has resulted from the hybridization of different Bd strains that came into contact in recent decades, and is now potentially replacing the less-virulent endemic strains of the pathogen (Farrer etal. 2011). In a new study published in this issue of Molecular Ecology, Schloegel etal. (2012) identify an additional unique Bd lineage that is endemic to the Atlantic Brazilian rainforests (Bd-Brazil) and provide striking evidence that the Bd-Brazil lineage has sexually recombined with the BdGPL lineage in an area where the two lineages likely came into contact as a result of classic anthropogenically mediated pathogen pollution(see below). Fungal pathogens, including Bd, have the propensity to form recombinant lineages when allopatric populations that have not yet formed genetic reproductive barriers are provided with opportunities to intermingle, and virulent strains may be selected for because they tend to be highly transmissible (Fisher etal. 2012). As Schloegel etal. (2012) point out, the demonstrated ability for Bd to undergo meiosis may also mean that it has the capacity to form a resistant spore stage (as yet undiscovered), based on extrapolation from other sexually reproducing chytrids that all have spore stages.\"'], ['Abiotic and Biotic Factors Associated with Tick Population Dynamics on a Mammalian Host: Ixodes hexagonus Infesting Otters, Lutra lutra,\"By: Sherrard-Smith, Ellie; Chadwick, Elizabeth; Cable, Joanne\",PLOS ONE  Volume: 7   Issue: 10     Article Number: e47131   Published: OCT 5 2012,\"The Eurasian otter, Lutra lutra, hosts several parasites with zoonotic potential. As this semiaquatic mammal has large ranges across terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats, it has the capacity for wide dispersion of pathogens. Despite this, parasites of otters have received relatively little attention. Here, we examine their ectoparasite load and assess whether this is influenced by abiotic or biotic variables. Climatic phenomena such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) affect weather conditions in northern Europe. Consequently parasite distributions, particularly species with life stages exposed to the external environment, can be affected. We assessed the extent to which inter-annual variations in large-scale weather patterns (specifically the NAO and Central England (CE) temperatures) and host characteristics influenced tick prevalence and intensity. Ectoparasites consisted of a single species, the nidiculous tick Ixodes hexagonus (prevalence = 24.3%; mean intensity = 7.2; range = 1-122; on n = 820 otter hosts). The prevalence, but not intensity of infestation, was associated with high CE temperatures, while both prevalence and intensity were associated with positive phases of the NAO. Such associations indicate that I. hexagonus are most abundant when weather conditions are warmer and wetter. Ticks were more prevalent on juvenile than sub-adult or adult otters, which probably reflects the length of time the hosts spend in the holt where these ticks quest. High tick number was associated with poor host condition, so either poor condition hosts are more susceptible to ticks, or tick infestations negatively impact on host condition. Otters are clearly an important and common host for I. hexagonus, which has implications for vector-borne diseases. This work is the first to consider the impacts of long-term weather patterns on I. hexagonus and uses wild-animal cadavers to illustrate the importance of abiotic and biotic pressures impacting parasitic populations.\"'], ['Anaplasma phagocytophilum in ticks from parks in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy,\"By: Aureli, Sara; Foley, Janet E.; Galuppi, Roberta; et al.\",VETERINARIA ITALIANA  Volume: 48   Issue: 4   Pages: 413-423   Published: OCT-DEC 2012,\"The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and phylogenetic characterisation of Anaplasma phagocytophilum in ticks in three parks of the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy, an area in which no survey of this agent had previously been conducted.

Msp4 gene sequences obtained from 7 samples were compared to those described in ruminants, especially roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and goat isolates from different countries. The results of this study provided evidence of the circulation of A. phagocytophilum in the sites studied and indicated the possible involvement of wild ruminants.

C.; et al.\",VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY  Volume: 188   Issue: 3-4   Pages: 346-354   Published: SEP 10 2012,\"Rodents are recognised as important hosts of ixodid ticks and as reservoirs of tick-borne pathogens across the world. Sympatric insectivores are usually inconspicuous and often overlooked as hosts of ticks and reservoirs of disease. Elephant shrews or sengis of the order Macroscelidea are small insectivores that often occur in sympatry with rodents in southern Africa. Sengis are invariably parasitised by large numbers of immature ticks while sympatric rodents are infested with very few. The reason for the difference in tick parasitism rates between these hosts is unknown. While a number of mechanisms are possible, we hypothesised that certain tick species exhibit \"\"true host specificity\"\" and as such would only attach and feed successfully on their preferred host or a very closely related host species. To investigate this, we conducted feeding experiments using two economically important tick species, the brown paralysis tick, Rhipicephalus warburtoni and the Karoo paralysis tick, Ixodes rubicundus and two sympatric small mammal species as potential hosts, the eastern rock sengi. Elephantulus myurus and the Namaqua rock mouse. Micaelamys namaquensis. Ticks attached and fed readily on E. myurus, but did not attach or feed successfully on M. namaquensis suggesting that these ticks exhibit true host specificity. We suggest that a kairomonal cue originating from the odour of E. myurus may stimulate the attachment and feeding of these ticks and that they further possess immunosuppressive mechanisms specific to E. myurus, allowing them to feed on this host species but not on M. namaquensis. This study highlights the importance of small mammalian insectivores as potential hosts of ixodid tick species and hence their potential as reservoirs of tick-borne pathogens. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Andrea; Ostfeld, Richard S.; Keesing, Felicia; et al.\",OIKOS  Volume: 121   Issue: 9   Pages: 1483-1492   Published: SEP 2012,\"Life histories of animals tend to vary along a slow to fast continuum. Those with fast life histories have shorter life spans, faster development, and higher reproductive rates relative to animals with slower life histories. These differences in life histories have been linked to differences in investment in immunological defenses. Animals with faster life histories are predicted to invest relatively more in innate immune responses, which include rapidly-deployed, non-specific defenses against a broad spectrum of invaders. On the other hand, animals with slower life histories are predicted to invest relatively more in adaptive immune responses, which are more slowly-deployed and are highly pathogen-specific. These predictions have been confirmed in some taxa, but other studies have not found this association. We tested this prediction by measuring innate and adaptive immunity of white-footed mice Peromyscus leucopus, chipmunks Tamias striatus, and gray squirrels Sciurus carolinensis, three species of rodents that inhabit deciduous forests in the northeastern US. These species exhibit a range of life histories, with mice having a relatively fast life history, squirrels a relatively slow one, and chipmunks an intermediate one. We found mice to have the greatest bacterial killing capacity, a common measure of innate immunity, and squirrels the lowest, consistent with the pace-of-life immune-defense hypothesis. We also found squirrels to mount the most pronounced antibody response when challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an immunogenic component of bacteria, while mice had the lowest, again consistent with predictions based on their life histories. These results have implications beyond ecoimmunology because the probability that a host species will transmit an infection its reservoir competence has been linked to its immune strategy. Understanding the relationship between immunology and reservoir competence is a critical frontier in the ecology of infectious diseases.\"'], ['Why is tick-borne encephalitis increasing? A review of the key factors causing the increasing incidence of human TBE in Sweden,\"By: Jaenson, Thomas G. T.; Hjertqvist, Marika; Bergstrom, Tomas; et al.\",PARASITES & VECTORS  Volume: 5     Article Number: 184   Published: AUG 31 2012,\"The highest annual incidence of human tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Sweden ever recorded by the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control (SMI) occurred last year, 2011. The number of TBE cases recorded during 2012 up to 6th August 2012 indicates that the incidence for 2012 could exceed that of 2011. In this review of the ecology and epidemiology of TBE in Sweden our main aim is to analyse the possible reasons behind the gradually increasing incidence of human TBE during the last 20 years. The main TBE virus (TBEV) vector to humans in Sweden is the nymphal stage of the common tick Ixodes ricinus. The main mode of transmission and maintenance of TBEV in the tick population is considered to be when infective nymphs co-feed with uninfected but infectible larvae on rodents. In most locations the roe deer, Capreolus capreolus is the main host for the reproducing adult I. ricinus ticks. The high number of roe deer for more than three decades has resulted in a very large tick population. Deer numbers have, however, gradually declined from the early 1990s to the present. This decline in roe deer numbers most likely made the populations of small rodents, which are reservoir-competent for TBEV, gradually more important as hosts for the immature ticks. Consequently, the abundance of TBEV-infected ticks has increased. Two harsh winters in 2009-2011 caused a more abrupt decline in roe deer numbers. This likely forced a substantial proportion of the \"\"host-seeking\"\" ticks to feed on bank voles (Myodes glareolus), which at that time suddenly had become very numerous, rather than on roe deer. Thus, the bank vole population peak in 2010 most likely caused many tick larvae to feed on reservoir-competent rodents. This presumably resulted in increased transmission of TBEV among ticks and therefore increased the density of infected ticks the following year. The unusually warm, humid weather and the prolonged vegetation period in 2011 permitted nymphs and adult ticks to quest for hosts nearly all days of that year. These weather conditions stimulated many people to spend time outdoors in areas where they were at risk of being attacked by infective nymphs. This resulted in at least 284 human cases of overt TBE. The tick season of 2012 also started early with an exceptionally warm March. The abundance of TBEV-infective \"\"hungry\"\" ticks was presumably still relatively high. Precipitation during June and July was rich and will lead to a \"\"good mushroom season\"\". These factors together are likely to result in a TBE incidence of 2012 similar to or higher than that of 2011.\"'], ['Environmental Factors and Risk Areas of West Nile Virus in Southern California, 2007-2009,\"By: Liu, Hua; Weng, Qihao\",ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT  Volume: 17   Issue: 4   Pages: 441-452   Published: AUG 2012,\"The West Nile virus (WNV) may post a significant health risk for mammals, including humans and insects. This study examines the spatial-temporal effects of environmental factors on WNV dissemination with a case study of ten counties in the southern California, where the epidemic was recently most prevalent within the USA. WNV surveillance data were obtained from the California Vectorborne Disease Surveillance System and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques were combined to derive environmental variables. Principal component analysis was performed to select the most relevant environmental variables. Two ecological zones were identified based on the selected variables. Identification of risk areas for WNV was limited to a zone with 95% mosquitoes surveillance records. Three time windows, the epidemiological weeks 18-26, 27-35, and 36-44 in each year of 2007-2009, were examined in details with risk area mapping. It is found that the southern part of San Joaquin Valley in Kern County and Los Angeles County (especially its southern part) were the most vulnerable locations for WNV outbreak. Main factors contributing to the WNV propagation included summer mean temperature, annual mean deviation from the mean temperature, land surface temperature, elevation, landscape complexity, landscape diversity, and vegetation water content. The result of this study improves understanding of WNV ecology and provides tools for detecting, tracking, and predicting the epidemic. The holistic approach developed for this study, which integrated remotely sensed, GIS-based, and in situ-measured environmental data with landscape metrics, may be applied to studies of other vector-borne diseases.\"'], ['Deer, predators, and the emergence of Lyme disease,\"By: Levi, Taal; Kilpatrick, A. Marm; Mangel, Marc; et al.\",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  Volume: 109   Issue: 27   Pages: 10942-10947   Published: JUL 3 2012,\"Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in North America, and both the annual incidence and geographic range are increasing. The emergence of Lyme disease has been attributed to a century-long recovery of deer, an important reproductive host for adult ticks. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that Lyme disease risk may now be more dynamically linked to fluctuations in the abundance of small-mammal hosts that are thought to infect the majority of ticks. The continuing and rapid increase in Lyme disease over the past two decades, long after the recolonization of deer, suggests that other factors, including changes in the ecology of small-mammal hosts may be responsible for the continuing emergence of Lyme disease. We present a theoretical model that illustrates how reductions in small-mammal predators can sharply increase Lyme disease risk. We then show that increases in Lyme disease in the northeastern and midwestern United States over the past three decades are frequently uncorrelated with deer abundance and instead coincide with a range-wide decline of a key small-mammal predator, the red fox, likely due to expansion of coyote populations. Further, across four states we find poor spatial correlation between deer abundance and Lyme disease incidence, but coyote abundance and fox rarity effectively predict the spatial distribution of Lyme disease in NewYork. These results suggest that changes in predator communities may have cascading impacts that facilitate the emergence of zoonotic diseases, the vast majority of which rely on hosts that occupy low trophic levels.\"'], ['Observations on Host Preference and Feeding Success of Immature Amblyomma maculatum (Acari: Ixodidae),\"By: Moraru, Gail Miriam; Goddard, Jerome; Varela-Stokes, Andrea S.\",JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE  Volume: 47   Issue: 3   Pages: 221-226   Published: JUL 2012,\"Amblyomma macula turn Koch is the primary vector in the United States for Rickettsia parkeri, an emerging human pathogen, as well as Hepatozoon americanum, a protozoan causing disease in canines. We evaluated the host preference and feeding success of immature A. maculatum for 3 potential host species, the Carolina anole (Anolis carolinensis Voigt), the bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus Linnaeus), and the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus Say and Ord). To determine host preference, ticks were given an option of two different hosts at a time. No ticks fed on anoles in the host preference study and no significant difference in preference could be determined for rats compared with quail. In a separate experiment to study feeding success, we placed ticks directly onto 10 individual animals of these same species. No ticks fed on anoles. Larvae did not statistically differ in number of days to engorge when feeding on rats (5.7 d) compared with quail (5.6 d). Nymphs, however, took significantly longer to engorge on rats (8.2 d) than on quail (7 d). Engorged larvae from rats and quail were not statistically different in weight, whereas nymphs that engorged on rats were significantly heavier (15.8 mg) than those from quail (13.2 mg). Engorged larvae and nymphs did not significantly differ in their molting success between hosts. Results of this study suggest that anoles were not good hosts for immature stages of A. maculatum. No clear host preference was identified for quail or cotton rats, although differences in time-to-engorgement and engorged specimen weights were noted.\"'], ['Some Analyses and Recommendations on Diet Formulation for Conservation Breeding of the Galapagos Rice Rat of Isla Santiago, Nesoryzomys swarthi,\"By: Wharton, Dan; Dowler, Robert; Watts, Jennifer\",ZOO BIOLOGY  Volume: 31   Issue: 4   Pages: 498-505   Published: JUL-AUG 2012,\"Nesoryzomys swarthi, the most endangered of the three surviving, endemic Galapagos rice rats, was only discovered in the early 20th Century and was considered extinct until its rediscovery in 1997 at a north-central coastal location on Isla Santiago. Potential threats to the entire genus include invasive rodent species, feral cats, new diseases, and climate change. These threats have been the basis for conservation breeding recommendations (as yet unmet) by several observers during the last several decades. This paper considers likely dietary requirements of N. swarthi in light of recent studies on the ecology of this species plus new data on the nutrient composition of Opuntia galapageia (a resource refuge for this species) and circulating vitamin values of animals sampled on Isla Santiago. It is concluded that, despite some unusually high mineral values for O. galapageia, a diet for N. swarthi under human care should be the same as it is for most other rodents, noting some caution in regard to possible needs for mineral and/or protein adjustment.

Contemporary eastern U.S. oak forests may exhibit dramatic resource pulses in part because of the loss of American chestnut, which comprised 2550% of the canopy throughout its range. Chestnut loss may have reduced mast resources for wildlife. A newly developed, blight-resistant hybrid makes reintroduction feasible within several years. We use historical data to model the effects of American chestnut mast on consumer populations, illuminating the potential ecological effects of a successful restoration. We parameterized a stochastic population growth model with mast production data to compare consumer population dynamics both pre- and post-blight. We explored the effect of maximum intrinsic population growth rate, degree of density dependence, and reliance upon mast on consumer response to chestnut loss. We parameterized the models for white-footed mouse, eastern chipmunk, gray squirrel, and white-tailed deer. At a northern site 14 years post-blight, simulated annual mast production decreased 80% and the coefficient of variation (CV) increased 60%. At a southern site 35 years post-blight, annual mast production decreased by 35% and the CV increased by 76%. Smaller, more variable mast crops translated to reduced abundance and increased variability in simulated consumer populations. White-footed mice were the most responsive, exhibiting a 48% decrease in population size and 57% increase in interannual variation post-blight. The reintroduction of blight-resistant chestnut may fundamentally alter predatorprey interactions, gypsy moth outbreaks, and Lyme disease hot spots through its effect on the character of resource pulses that drive consumer dynamics.\"'], ['Intestinal microbiota composition in fishes is influenced by host ecology and environment,\"By: Wong, Sandi; Rawls, John F.\",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY  Volume: 21   Issue: 13   Pages: 3100-3102   Published: JUL 2012,\"The digestive tracts of vertebrates are colonized by complex assemblages of micro-organisms, collectively called the gut microbiota. Recent studies have revealed important contributions of gut microbiota to vertebrate health and disease, stimulating intense interest in understanding how gut microbial communities are assembled and how they impact host fitness (Sekirov 2010). Although all vertebrates harbour a gut microbiota, current information on microbiota composition and function has been derived primarily from mammals. Comparisons of different mammalian species have revealed intriguing associations between gut microbiota composition and host diet, anatomy and phylogeny (Ley 2008b). However, mammals constitute 10% of all vertebrate species, and it remains unclear whether similar associations exist in more diverse and ancient vertebrate lineages such as fish. In this issue, Sullam (2012) make an important contribution toward identifying factors determining gut microbiota composition in fishes. The authors conducted a detailed meta-analysis of 25 bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence libraries derived from the intestines of different fish species. To provide a broader context for their analysis, they compared these data sets to a large collection of 16S rRNA gene sequence data sets from diverse free-living and host-associated bacterial communities. Their results suggest that variation in gut microbiota composition in fishes is strongly correlated with species habitat salinity, trophic level and possibly taxonomy. Comparison of data sets from fish intestines and other environments revealed that fish gut microbiota compositions are often similar to those of other animals and contain relatively few free-living environmental bacteria. These results suggest that the gut microbiota composition of fishes is not a simple reflection of the micro-organisms in their local habitat but may result from host-specific selective pressures within the gut (Bevins & Salzman 2011).\"'], ['Do Animals Living in Larger Groups Experience Greater Parasitism? A Meta-Analysis,\"By: Rifkin, Joanna L.; Nunn, Charles L.; Garamszegi, Laszlo Z.\",AMERICAN NATURALIST  Volume: 180   Issue: 1   Pages: 70-82   Published: JUL 2012,\"Parasitism is widely viewed as the primary cost of sociality and a constraint on group size, yet studies report varied associations between group size and parasitism. Using the largest database of its kind, we performed a meta-analysis of 69 studies of the relationship between group size and parasite risk, as measured by parasitism and immune defenses. We predicted a positive correlation between group size and parasitism with organisms that show contagious and environmental transmission and a negative correlation for searching parasites, parasitoids, and possibly vector-borne parasites (on the basis of the encounter-dilution effect). Overall, we found a positive effect of group size (r = 0.187) that varied in magnitude across transmission modes and measures of parasite risk, with only weak indications of publication bias. Among different groups of hosts, we found a stronger relationship between group size and parasite risk in birds than in mammals, which may be driven by ecological and social factors. A metaregression showed that effect sizes increased with maximum group size. Phylogenetic meta-analyses revealed no evidence for phylogenetic signal in the strength of the group size-parasitism relationship. We conclude that group size is a weak predictor of parasite risk except in species that live in large aggregations, such as colonial birds, in which effect sizes are larger.\"'], ['Linking sanitary and ecological requirements in the management of avian scavengers: effectiveness of fencing against mammals in supplementary feeding sites,\"By: Moreno-Opo, Ruben; Margalida, Antoni; Garcia, Francisco; et al.\",BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION  Volume: 21   Issue: 7   Pages: 1673-1685   Published: JUN 2012,\"In order to ensure that the objectives behind the conservation of biodiversity are fulfilled it is essential that policies of all stakeholders are compatible. This is the case of the application of sanitary measures for the management of animal by-products and the negative effects that such restrictions had on the population dynamics and behavioural ecology of the avian scavengers\\' guild. Thus, measures that allow these species to feed and that reduce risks of disease transmission must be put into practice. This study aims to improve the technical implementation of one of the commonest tools employed in the conservation of avian scavengers: supplementary feeding stations. We evaluated the permeability of three types of fences in experimental feeding stations to determine which of the models prevent non-target species from accessing the food provided. We compared results from fenced-off feeding stations with those from random points in unfenced-off sites. The results showed that two of the models ( and ) were the most effective avoiding facultative mammal scavengers from gaining access into the exclosure for over two months and for 7-8 inputs of food. Avian scavengers were able to access food regardless of the type of exclosure, which did not determine the abundance of birds or the species present. The carrion consumption by non-target species can be reduced by affordable and sustainable means. We suggest proposals to optimize the management of supplementary feeding stations for threatened avian scavengers and for the design of fenced exclosures.\"'], ['Primate Disease Ecology in Comparative and Theoretical Perspective,\"By: Nunn, Charles L.\",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY  Volume: 74   Issue: 6   Pages: 497-509   Published: JUN 2012,\"Infectious disease plays a major role in the lives of wild primates, and the past decade has witnessed significant strides in our understanding of primate disease ecology. In this review, I briefly describe some key findings from phylogenetic comparative approaches, focusing on analyses of parasite richness that use the Global Mammal Parasite Database. While these studies have provided new answers to fundamental questions, new questions have arisen, including questions about the underlying epidemiological mechanisms that produce the broader phylogenetic patterns. I discuss two examples in which theoretical models have given us new traction on these comparative questions. First, drawing on findings of a positive association between range use intensity and the richness of helminth parasites, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model to investigate the underlying drivers of this pattern. From this model, we are gaining deeper understanding of how range use intensity results in greater exposure to parasites, thus producing higher prevalence in the simulated populationsand, plausibly, higher parasite richness in comparative analyses. Second, I show how a model of disease spread on social networks provides solid theoretical foundations for understanding the effects of sociality and group size on parasitism across primate species. This study further revealed that larger social groups are more subdivided, which should slow the spread of infectious diseases. This effect could offset the increased disease risk expected in larger social groups, which has yet to receive strong empirical support in our comparative analyses. In addition to these examples, I discuss the need for more meta-analyses of individual-level phenomena documented in the field, and for greater linkage between theoretical modeling and field research.

This is particularly true in breeding colonies, and is especially relevant when attempting to eliminate specific pathogens from a population of primates. Numerous strategies have been used to establish such specific pathogen free (SPF) breeding colonies (primarily of macaques), ranging from nursery rearing of neonates to single housing of socially reared yearlings to the rearing of infants in large social groups. All these strategies attempt to balance the effects of the chosen socialization strategy on parameters related to disease transmission, including the ultimate elimination of the target pathogens. Such strategies may affect the overall disease states of NHP breeding colonies through selective breeding processes. This can occur either by creating subpopulations of animals that do not have target diseases (SPF colonies), but may have other issues; or by creating situations in which the best animals are sold and the breeding colony is stocked with animals that may be more disease susceptible than those that were sold. The disease states of NHP research colonies also may be affected by selective utilization programs, in which animals removed from the breeding colony for health/behavior reasons, are preferentially chosen for use in scientific investigations. Such utilization criteria raise the question of whether ideal subjects are being chosen for use in research. Finally, captive primate colonies, where both socialization and disease states are intensely managed, may provide opportunities for those testing predictions from models of the interactions of socialization and disease transmission in the evolution of wild populations of NHP. This would be especially true for some extreme conditions of these disease ecology models, given the exceedingly high social densities and levels of pathogen control that exist in many captive nonhuman primate colonies.

Eduardo; Polop, Jaime J.; Owen, Robert D.; et al.\",JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES  Volume: 48   Issue: 2   Pages: 267-281   Published: APR 2012,\"Thirteen hantavirus genotypes, associated with at least 12 sigmodontine reservoir rodents, have been recognized in the four countries that represent the Southern Cone of South America. Host-virus relationships are not as well defined as in North America; several Southern Cone hantaviruses appear to share a common host and some viruses do not occur throughout the range of their host. Although hantavirus-host relationships in the Southern Cone are less strictly concordant with the single-host-single-virus pattern reported elsewhere, recent studies suggest that much of the ambiguity may result from an incomplete understanding of host and hantavirus systematics. Although some Southern Cone host species are habitat generalists, some sympatric species are habitat specialists, helping to explain bow some strict host-virus pairings may be maintained. In some cases, host population densities were higher in peridomestic habitats and prevalence of hantavirus infection was higher in host populations in peridomestic habitats. Seasonal and multiyear patterns in climate and human disturbance affect host population densities, prevalence of infection, and disease risk to humans. Unusually high hantavirus antibody prevalence in indigenous human populations may be associated with frequent and close contact with host rodents. Ongoing studies are improving our understanding of hantavirus-host ecology and providing tools that may predict human risk.\"'], ['Synanthropy of Wild Mammals as a Determinant of Emerging Infectious Diseases in the Asian-Australasian Region,\"By: McFarlane, Ro; Sleigh, Adrian; McMichael, Tony\",ECOHEALTH  Volume: 9   Issue: 1   Pages: 24-35   Published: MAR 2012,\"Humans create ecologically simplified landscapes that favour some wildlife species, but not others. Here, we explore the possibility that those species that tolerate or do well in human-modified environments, or \\'synanthropic\\' species, are predominantly the hosts of zoonotic emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). We do this using global wildlife conservation data and wildlife host information extracted from systematically reviewed emerging infectious disease literature. The evidence for this relationship is examined with special emphasis on the Australasian, South East Asian and East Asian regions. We find that synanthropic wildlife hosts are approximately 15 times more likely than other wildlife in this region to be the source of emerging infectious diseases, and this association is essentially independent of the taxonomy of the species. A significant positive association with EIDs is also evident for those wildlife species of low conservation risk. Since the increase and spread of native and introduced species able to adapt to human-induced landscape change is at the expense of those species most vulnerable to habitat loss, our findings suggest a mechanism linking land conversion, global decline in biodiversity and a rise in EIDs of wildlife origin.\"'], ['The Ecology of Fear: Host Foraging Behavior Varies with the Spatio-temporal Abundance of a Dominant Ectoparasite,\"By: Fritzsche, Alexa; Allan, Brian F.\",ECOHEALTH  Volume: 9   Issue: 1   Pages: 70-74   Published: MAR 2012,\"Prey engage in myriad behaviors to avoid predation, and these indirect effects of predators on their prey are often measured by the amount of food abandoned by a forager (the \"\"giving-up density\"\", or GUD) in a given habitat. Recent evidence suggests that hosts may engage in comparable behaviors to avoid exposure to parasites. We investigated changes in local foraging and regional space use by mammal hosts for the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum), using GUDs as an indicator of the perceived risk of parasitism. At eight study sites at the Tyson Research Center (Eureka, MO), we placed two feeding trays, one on the ground and one at 1.5 m height in a tree, in order to assess how the emergence of ground-dwelling ticks affected foraging by several mammal species both locally (between the two GUD stations) and regionally (among the eight sites, mean distance 1064 m apart). Though GUDs did not differ between the ground and tree GUD stations, we did find that greater amounts of food were \"\"given-up\"\" at sites with higher abundances of ticks. This increase in food abandonment suggests that hosts respond to the risk of parasitism and alter their space use accordingly, potentially affecting a cascade of other ecological interactions across large spatial scales.\"'], ['The impact of a utility corridor on terrestrial gastropod biodiversity,\"By: Nekola, Jeffrey C.\",BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION  Volume: 21   Issue: 3   Pages: 781-795   Published: MAR 2012,\"Utility corridors are often thought to be disruptive to biodiversity because they cause habitat fragmentation that may lead to increases in predation, parasitism, disease transmittance and vagrant species while decreasing migration rates, gene flow and genetic diversity for interior species. Species with poor dispersal abilities, sedentary lifestyles, and specialized habitats have been thought to be potentially the most vulnerable to these effects. Terrestrial gastropods thus serve as a valuable system in which to investigate these impacts because they are among the poorest active dispersers in the animal kingdom. To document the impact of corridor formation on land snail biodiversity, a 75-year old powerline right-of-way in the eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan was chosen for analysis. While terrestrial gastropod richness and abundance was significantly reduced for corridor as compared to adjacent control subsamples, with a 2/3 turnover in species composition, the corridor fauna is similar to nearby native grassland sites in terms of species composition, abundance distribution, and numbers and abundance of species of conservation concern. The fauna of control subsamples immediately adjacent to the corridor remained similar to other undisturbed sites in the region, with multiple species of conservation concern persisting at distances of only 30 m from the corridor. Thus, the net impact of corridor generation has been arguably positive: while the surrounding forest fauna has not been degraded, within the corridor the reduction of forest species has been compensated for by establishment of even rarer grassland species.\"'], ['Polarotactic tabanids find striped patterns with brightness and/or polarization modulation least attractive: an advantage of zebra stripes,\"By: Egri, Adam; Blaho, Miklos; Kriska, Gyoergy; et al.\",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY  Volume: 215   Issue: 5   Pages: 736-745   Published: MAR 2012,\"The characteristic striped appearance of zebras has provoked much speculation about its function and why the pattern has evolved, but experimental evidence is scarce. Here, we demonstrate that a zebra-striped horse model attracts far fewer horseflies (tabanids) than either homogeneous black, brown, grey or white equivalents. Such biting flies are prevalent across Africa and have considerable fitness impact on potential mammalian hosts. Besides brightness, one of the likely mechanisms underlying this protection is the polarization of reflected light from the host animal. We show that the attractiveness of striped patterns to tabanids is also reduced if only polarization modulations (parallel stripes with alternating orthogonal directions of polarization) occur in horizontal or vertical homogeneous grey surfaces. Tabanids have been shown to respond strongly to linearly polarized light, and we demonstrate here that the light and dark stripes of a zebra\\'s coat reflect very different polarizations of light in a way that disrupts the attractiveness to tabanids. We show that the attractiveness to tabanids decreases with decreasing stripe width, and that stripes below a certain size are effective in not attracting tabanids. Further, we demonstrate that the stripe widths of zebra coats fall in a range where the striped pattern is most disruptive to tabanids. The striped coat patterns of several other large mammals may also function in reducing exposure to tabanids by similar mechanisms of differential brightness and polarization of reflected light. This work provides an experimentally supported explanation for the underlying mechanism leading to the selective advantage of a black-and-white striped coat pattern.\"'], ['Temporal stability and species specificity in bacteria associated with the bottlenose dolphins respiratory system,\"By: Lima, Nicole; Rogers, Tracey; Acevedo-Whitehouse, Karina; et al.\",ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS  Volume: 4   Issue: 1   Special Issue: SI   Pages: 89-96   Published: FEB 2012,\"We demonstrate that the exhaled breath condensate, or \\'blow\\', from marine mammals can be used to examine respiratory associated microbial communities using non-invasive sampling methods. Blow samples from two species of bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus and T. aduncus, along with hybrid offspring, were examined using molecular microbial ecology methods. A temporal analysis revealed that microbial community structure of each individual remained distinct from other individuals over a two-month period, indicting strong host specificity. The taxonomic composition of samples, based on pyrosequencing of the V1-V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene, from 24 healthy individuals was dominated by the Cardiobacteraceae lineage of Gammaproteobacteria, comprising on average 52% of sequences in all samples. Sequences in this taxa were associated with novel clades that contain only sequences from dolphin respiratory tracts. Other genera that likely form part of the core biota include the Saccharospirillaceae (Gammaproteobacteria), Arcobacter (Epsilonproteobacteria), Hydrogenimonaceae (Epsilonproteobacteria), Halotalea (Gammaproteobacteria), Aquimarina (Flavobacteria) and Helococcus (Clostridia). Significant differences between samples from different species were observed only at the species/strain level, driven by the relative contributions of strains from the most common phylogenetic lineages. Analysis of communities associated with hybrid animals provides tentative evidence for a paternal role in community assembly. Clear overlap was observed with data collected by capture and swabbing of bottlenose dolphins blowholes, indicating this method provides a novel non-invasive alternative to monitoring marine mammal population health.\"'], ['Effects of Host Diversity on Infectious Disease,\"By: Ostfeld, Richard S.; Keesing, Felicia\",\"Edited by: Futuyma, DJ\",\"The dynamics of infectious diseases can be affected by genetic diversity within host populations, species diversity within host communities, and diversity among communities. In principle, diversity can either increase or decrease pathogen transmission and disease risk. Theoretical models and laboratory experiments have demonstrated that a dilution effect (decreased disease risk with increasing diversity) can occur under a wide range of conditions. Field studies of plants, aquatic invertebrates, amphibians, birds, and mammals demonstrate that the phenomenon indeed does occur in many natural systems. A dilution effect is expected when (a) hosts differ in quality for pathogens or vectors; (b) higher quality hosts tend to occur in species-poor communities, whereas lower quality hosts tend to occur in more diverse communities; and (c) lower quality hosts regulate abundance of high-quality hosts or of vectors, or reduce encounter rates between these hosts and pathogens or vectors. Although these conditions characterize many disease systems, our ability to predict when and where the dilution effect occurs remains poor. The life-history traits that cause some hosts to be widespread and resilient might be correlated with those that promote infection and transmission by some pathogens, supporting the notion that the dilution effect might be widespread among disease systems. Criticisms of the dilution effect have focused on whether species richness or species composition (both being metrics of biodiversity) drives disease risk. It is well established, however, that changes in species composition correlate with changes in species richness, and this correlation could explain why the dilution effect appears to be a general phenomenon.\"'], ['A review of the evidence for potential impacts of black rats (Rattus rattus) on wildlife and humans in Australia,\"By: Banks, Peter B.; Hughes, Nelika K.\",WILDLIFE RESEARCH  Volume: 39   Issue: 1   Pages: 78-88   Published: 2012,\"The black rat (Rattus rattus) is among the world\\'s worst invasive species, having spread across the globe in close association with the spread of human settlement.

Age structures, sex ratios and reproductive aspects of these species were measured from October to December 2009 (wet period) and February to April 2010 (dry period) in the rooms and yards of 40 households for three consecutive nights in each month. A total of 379 commensal rodents were captured (322 M. musculus and 57 R. rattus). M. musculus was more abundant during the dry period with a population that consisted mainly of adults and featured a sex ratio differed from 1:1 in both periods. The population of Rattus ratios consisted mainly of subadults. Commensal rodents were captured in the yards as well as within the houses in ovens, cupboards, etc. Elementary data were obtained regarding the biology of the two commensal species, while the potential health risks to the local inhabitants from close contact with these species were highlighted.

A variety of processes, operating across a range of spatial scales, are likely to influence both the probability of parasite encounter and subsequent infection. Here, we explored eight possible determinants of parasite richness, comprising rainfall and temperature at the population level, ranging behavior and home range productivity at the group level, and age, sex, body condition, and social rank at the individual level. We used a unique dataset describing gastrointestinal parasites in a terrestrial subtropical vertebrate (chacma baboons, Papio ursinus), comprising 662 fecal samples from 86 individuals representing all age-sex classes across two groups over two dry seasons in a desert population. Three mixed models were used to identify the most important factor at each of the three spatial scales (population, group, individual); these were then standardized and combined in a single, global, mixed model. Individual age had the strongest influence on parasite richness, in a convex relationship. Parasite richness was also higher in females and animals in poor condition, albeit at a lower order of magnitude than age. Finally, with a further halving of effect size, parasite richness was positively correlated to day range and temperature. These findings indicate that a range of factors influence host parasite richness through both encounter and infection probabilities but that individual-level processes may be more important than those at the group or population level.

The long-term ecological impact of pathogens on group-living, large mammal populations is largely unknown. We evaluated the impact of a pathogenic bacterium, Streptococcus equi ruminatorum, and other key ecological factors on the dynamics of the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta population in the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania.2. We compared key demographic parameters during two years when external signs of bacterial infection were prevalent (\\'outbreak\\') and periods of five years before and after the outbreak when such signs were absent or rare. We also tested for density dependence and calculated the basic reproductive rate R(0) of the bacterium.3. During the five pre-outbreak years, the mean annual hyena mortality rate was 0 088, and annual population growth was relatively high (13.6%). During the outbreak, mortality increased by 78% to a rate of 0.156, resulting in an annual population decline of 4.3%. After the outbreak, population size increased moderately (5.1%) during the first three post- outbreak years before resuming a growth similar to pre- outbreak levels (13.9%). We found no evidence that these demographic changes were driven by density dependence or other ecological factors.4. Most hyenas showed signs of infection when prey abundance in their territory was low. During the outbreak, mortality increased among adult males and yearlings, but not among adult females the socially dominant group members. These results suggest that infection and mortality were modulated by factors linked to low social status and poor nutrition. During the outbreak, we estimated R(0) for the bacterium to be 2.7, indicating relatively fast transmission.5. Our results suggest that the short- term ` top- down\\' impact of S. equi ruminatorum during the outbreak was driven by \\'bottom-up\\' effects on nutritionally disadvantaged age- sex classes, whereas the longer- termpost- outbreak reduction in population growth was caused by poor survival of juveniles during the outbreak and subsequent poor recruitment of breeding females. These results suggest synergistic effects of \\'bottom-up\\' and \\'top-down\\' processes on host population dynamics.\"'], ['What Do We Need to Know About Disease Ecology to Prevent Lyme Disease in the Northeastern United States?,\"By: Eisen, Rebecca J.; Piesman, Joseph; Zielinski-Gutierrez, Emily; et al.\",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY  Volume: 49   Issue: 1   Pages: 11-22   Published: JAN 2012,\"Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in the United States, with the majority of cases occurring in the Northeast. It has now been three decades since the etiological agent of the disease in North America, the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, and its primary North American vectors, the ticks Ixodes scapularis Say and I. pacificus Cooley & Kohls, were identified. Great strides have been made in our understanding of the ecology of the vectors and disease agent, and this knowledge has been used to design a wide range of prevention and control strategies. However, despite these advances, the number of Lyme disease cases have steadily increased. In this article, we assess potential reasons for the continued lack of success in prevention and control of Lyme disease in the northeastern United States, and identify conceptual areas where additional knowledge could be used to improve Lyme disease prevention and control strategies. Some of these areas include: 1) identifying critical host infestation rates required to maintain enzootic transmission of B. burgdorferi, 2) understanding how habitat diversity and forest fragmentation impacts acarological risk of exposure to B. burgdorferi and the ability of interventions to reduce risk, 3) quantifying the epidemiological outcomes of interventions focusing on ticks or vertebrate reservoirs, and 4) refining knowledge of how human behavior influences Lyme disease risk and identifying barriers to the adoption of personal protective measures and environmental tick management.\"'], ['Population genetic structure and natal philopatry in the widespread North American bat Myotis lucifugus,\"By: Dixon, Michael D.\",JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY  Volume: 92   Issue: 6   Pages: 1343-1351   Published: DEC 2011,\"Molecular genetics tools have been used recently to investigate aspects of bat biology, including the degree of male- and female-driven gene flow among populations. However, none of this work has focused on the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), one of the most common bats in North America. Previous work using mark-recapture suggests that like many mammals, including other temperate vespertilionid bats, gene flow in this species is largely driven by males, whereas females return to the roosts in which they were born to rear pups. To determine if this species displays a pattern of population genetic structure that is consistent with this hypothesis I sampled 182 female M. lucifugus at 12 maternity colonies throughout Minnesota. Using a portion of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b and 10 polymorphic nuclear microsatellites, I found significant structure among colonies, and population differentiation was slightly higher for the mitochondrial locus. This supports the hypothesis that female M. lucifugus display some degree of natal philopatry, but the inferred female dispersal rate was high. The pattern of structure was complex and demonstrates that unequal gene flow among maternity colonies is occurring and that the co-occurrence of breeding populations within maternity colonies and/or inbreeding could be confounding estimates of population genetic structure among these colonies. The patterns of population genetic structure and natal philopatry imply that both seasonal migration and dispersal by females should be considered as possible factors in the spread of emerging infectious diseases such as white-nose syndrome.\"'], ['Hantaan virus surveillance targeting small mammals at Dagmar North Training Area, Gyeonggi Province, Republic of Korea, 2001-2005,\"By: Klein, Terry A.; Kang, Hae Ji; Gu, Se Hun; et al.\",JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY  Volume: 36   Issue: 2   Pages: 373-381   Published: DEC 2011,\"In response to a hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome case in November 2000, a seasonal rodent-borne disease surveillance program was initiated at Dagmar North Training Area (DNTA), Gyeonggi Province, Republic of Korea.

Where do they go and what do they do? These basic questions are key not only to understanding a species\\' ecology and evolution, but also for addressing many of the environmental challenges we currently face, including problems posed by invasive species, the spread of zoonotic diseases and declines in wildlife populations due to anthropogenic climate and land-use changes. Monitoring the movements and activities of wild animals can be difficult, especially when the species in question are small, cryptic or move over large areas. In this paper, we describe an Automated Radio-Telemetry System (ARTS) that we designed and built on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama to overcome these challenges. We describe the hardware and software we used to implement the ARTS, and discuss the scientific successes we have had using the system, as well as the logistical challenges we faced in maintaining the system in real-world, rainforest conditions. The ARTS uses automated radio-telemetry receivers mounted on 40-m towers topped with arrays of directional antennas to track the activity and location of radio-collared study animals, 24 h a day, 7 days a week. These receiving units are connected by a wireless network to a server housed in the laboratory on BCI, making these data available in real time to researchers via a web-accessible database. As long as study animals are within the range of the towers, the ARTS system collects data more frequently than typical animal-borne global positioning system collars (similar to 12 locations/h) with lower accuracy (approximately 50 m) but at much reduced cost per tag (similar to 10X less expensive). The geographic range of ARTS, like all VHF telemetry, is affected by the size of the radio-tag as well as its position in the forest (e. g. tags in the canopy transmit farther than those on the forest floor). We present a model of signal propagation based on landscape conditions, which quantifies these effects and identifies sources of interference, including weather events and human activity. ARTS has been used to track 374 individual animals from 38 species, including 17 mammal species, 12 birds, 7 reptiles or amphibians, as well as two species of plant seeds. These data elucidate the spatio-temporal dynamics of animal activity and movement at the site and have produced numerous peer-reviewed publications, student theses, magazine articles, educational programs and film documentaries. These data are also relevant to long-term population monitoring and conservation plans. Both the successes and the failures of the ARTS system are applicable to broader sensor network applications and are valuable for advancing sensor network research.\"'], ['Identifying hotspots of chimpanzee group activity from transect surveys in Tai National Park, Cote d\\'Ivoire,\"By: Kouakou, Celestin Yao; Boesch, Christophe; Kuehl, Hjalmar S.\",JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY  Volume: 27   Pages: 621-630   Part: 6   Published: NOV 2011,\"Locating activity hotspots-areas of higher density, more intense use, or distinct social units-is a prerequisite for answering many questions in animal ecology. However, for many species, carrying out such research from direct observations in tropical habitat is time-consuming and unrealistic for non-habituated animals. This study aimed to locate chimpanzee home ranges from transect nest counts. For validation purposes, 233 line transects were sampled within the home ranges of four habituated social groups of chimpanzees in Tai National Park, Cote d\\'Ivoire. In total, 373 km of transects were surveyed over 188 days and 683 nests of chimpanzee were recorded. First, we characterized heterogeneity of nest distribution patterns, including variation in density and group size within the area. Second, we used scan statistics, a likelihood-based cluster technique to locate chimpanzee social groups and compared them with the known home range boundaries. Chimpanzee nest distribution was characterized by a positive density and group-size gradient away from the range periphery. Furthermore, nest distribution clusters corresponding to the four groups could be successfully identified, although additional clusters for, for example, low-density areas between social groups seem to be an unavoidable by-product. The approach taken can be extended to a wide spectrum of data stemming from direct observations, camera traps, acoustic or genetic sampling to derive information about structure and patchiness of wild animal populations.\"'], ['Human-Related Factors Regulate the Spatial Ecology of Domestic Cats in Sensitive Areas for Conservation,\"By: Ferreira, Joaquim P.; Leitao, Ines; Santos-Reis, Margarida; et al.\",PLOS ONE  Volume: 6   Issue: 10     Article Number: e25970   Published: OCT 17 2011,\"Background: Domestic cats ranging freely in natural areas are a conservation concern due to competition, predation, disease transmission or hybridization with wildcats. In order to improve our ability to design effective control policies, we investigate the factors affecting their numbers and space use in natural areas of continental Europe.Methodology/Principal Findings: We describe the patterns of cat presence, abundance and space use and analyse the associated environmental and human constraints in a well-preserved Mediterranean natural area with small scattered local farms. We failed in detecting cats in areas away from human settlements (trapping effort above 4000 trap-nights), while we captured 30 individuals near inhabited farms. We identified 130 cats, all of them in farms still in use by people (30% of 128 farms). All cats were free-ranging and very wary of people. The main factor explaining the presence of cats was the presence of people, while the number of cats per farm was mostly affected by the occasional food provisioning with human refuse and the presence of people. The home ranges of eight radio tagged cats were centred at inhabited farms. Males went furthest away from the farms during the mating season (3.8 km on average, maximum 6.3 km), using inhabited farms as stepping-stones in their mating displacements (2.2 km of maximum inter-farm distance moved). In their daily movements, cats notably avoided entering in areas with high fox density.Conclusions: The presence, abundance and space use of cats were heavily dependent on human settlements. Any strategy aiming at reducing their impact in areas of conservation concern should aim at the presence of settlements and their spatial spread and avoid any access to human refuse. The movements of domestic cats would be limited in areas with large patches of natural vegetation providing good conditions for other carnivore mammals such as red foxes.\"'], ['Impact of the experimental removal of lizards on Lyme disease risk,\"By: Swei, Andrea; Ostfeld, Richard S.; Lane, Robert S.; et al.\",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES  Volume: 278   Issue: 1720   Pages: 2970-2978   Published: OCT 7 2011,\"The distribution of vector meals in the host community is an important element of understanding and predicting vector-borne disease risk. Lizards (such as the western fence lizard; Sceloporus occidentalis) play a unique role in Lyme disease ecology in the far-western United States. Lizards rather than mammals serve as the blood meal hosts for a large fraction of larval and nymphal western black-legged ticks (Ixodes pacificus-the vector for Lyme disease in that region) but are not competent reservoirs for the pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi. Prior studies have suggested that the net effect of lizards is to reduce risk of human exposure to Lyme disease, a hypothesis that we tested experimentally. Following experimental removal of lizards, we documented incomplete host switching by larval ticks (5.19%) from lizards to other hosts. Larval tick burdens increased on woodrats, a competent reservoir, but not on deer mice, a less competent pathogen reservoir. However, most larvae failed to find an alternate host. This resulted in significantly lower densities of nymphal ticks the following year. Unexpectedly, the removal of reservoir-incompetent lizards did not cause an increase in nymphal tick infection prevalence. The net result of lizard removal was a decrease in the density of infected nymphal ticks, and therefore a decreased risk to humans of Lyme disease. Our results indicate that an incompetent reservoir for a pathogen may, in fact, increase disease risk through the maintenance of higher vector density and therefore, higher density of infected vectors.\"'], ['Bird biting mosquitoes and human disease: A review of the role of Culex pipiens complex mosquitoes in epidemiology,\"By: Farajollahi, Ary; Fonseca, Dina M.; Kramer, Laura D.; et al.\",INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION  Volume: 11   Issue: 7   Pages: 1577-1585   Published: OCT 2011,\"The transmission of vector-borne pathogens is greatly influenced by the ecology of their vector, which is in turn shaped by genetic ancestry, the environment, and the hosts that are fed on. One group of vectors, the mosquitoes in the Culex pipiens complex, play key roles in the transmission of a range of pathogens including several viruses such as West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis viruses, avian malaria (Plasmodium spp.), and filarial worms. The Cx. pipiens complex includes Culex pipiens pipiens with two forms, pipiens and molestus, Culex pipiens pallens, Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex australicus, and Culex globocoxitus. While several members of the complex have limited geographic distributions, Cx. pipiens pipiens and Cx. quinquefasciatus are found in all known urban and sub-urban temperate and tropical regions, respectively, across the world, where they are often principal disease vectors. In addition, hybrids are common in areas of overlap. Although gaps in our knowledge still remain, the advent of genetic tools has greatly enhanced our understanding of the history of speciation, domestication, dispersal, and hybridization. We review the taxonomy, genetics, evolution, behavior, and ecology of members of the Cx. pipiens complex and their role in the transmission of medically important pathogens. The adaptation of Cx. pipiens complex mosquitoes to human-altered environments led to their global distribution through dispersal via humans and, combined with their mixed feeding patterns on birds and mammals (including humans), increased the transmission of several avian pathogens to humans. We highlight several unanswered questions that will increase our ability to control diseases transmitted by these mosquitoes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A.\",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY  Volume: 146   Issue: 2   Pages: 313-318   Published: OCT 2011,\"All great apes build nightly a structure (\"\"nest\"\" or \"\"bed\"\") that is assumed to function primarily as a sleeping-platform. However, several other nest function hypotheses have been proposed: antipredation, antipathogen, and thermoregulation. I tested these simple shelter functions of chimpanzee nests in an experiment for which I was the subject in Fongoli, Senegal. I slept 11 nights in chimpanzee nests and on the bare ground to test for differences in sleep quality, potential exposure to disease through bites from possible vectors, and insulation. No difference was found in the total amount of sleep nor in sleep quality; however, sleep was more disturbed on the ground. Differences in sleep disturbance between arboreal and ground conditions seemed primarily due to causes of anxiety and alertness, e.g., vocalizations of terrestrial mammals. Arboreal nest-sleeping seems to reduce risk of bites from possible disease vectors and provide insulation in cold conditions. This preliminary, but direct, test of chimpanzee nest function has implications for the evolutionary transition from limb-roosting to nest-reclining sleep in the hominoids, and from tree-to-ground sleep in the genus Homo.

The strains isolated from the same vector species or the same Rhodnius evolutionary line presented the same genotypes, even in cases where strains had been isolated from vectors captured in geographically distant regions. The dendrogram constructed from the SL-IR sequences separated all of them into two main groups, one with the genotypes isolated from R. prolixus and the other group containing three well defined sub-groups with the genotypes isolated from R. pallescens, R. colombiensis and R. ecuadoriensis.

Disruptions to ecosystems have been found to increase the risk of several diseases, including Hantavirus, Lyme disease, Ross River virus, malaria and Ciguatera fish poisoning. Leptospirosis is a globally important emerging zoonosis, caused by spirochaete bacteria, borne by many mammalian hosts, and also transmitted environmentally. We propose that leptospirosis incidence in humans is also linked to ecosystem disruption, and that reduced biodiversity (the diversity of species within an ecological community) may be associated with increased leptospirosis incidence. To investigate this hypothesis, the relationship between biodiversity levels of island nations and their annual leptospirosis incidence rates (adjusted for GDP per capita) was examined by linear correlation and regression. Supportive, statistically significant negative associations were obtained between leptospirosis incidence and (a) total number of species (r(2) = 0.69, p  0.001) and (b) number of mammal species (r(2) = 0.80, p  0.001) in univariate analysis. In multivariable analysis only the number of mammal species remained significantly associated (r(2) = 0.81, p = 0.007). An association between biodiversity and reduced leptospirosis risk, if supported by further research, would emphasise the importance of managing the emergence of leptospirosis (and other infectious diseases) at a broader, ecosystem level.

Of 647 blood samples collected from shrews, 121 (18.7%) showed evidence of infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum and 196 (30.3%) with Babesia microti. By comparison, of 1505 blood samples from field voles, 96 (6.4%) were positive for A. phagocytophilum and 458 (30.4%) for Ba. microti. Both species were infested with the ticks Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes trianguliceps, although they had different burdens: on average, shrews carried almost six times as many I. trianguliceps larvae, more than twice as many I. ricinus larvae, and over twice as many nymphs (both tick species combined). The finding that the nymphs collected from shrews were almost exclusively I. trianguliceps highlights that this species is the key vector of these infections in this small mammal community. These findings suggest that common shrews are a reservoir of tick-borne infections and that the role of shrews in the ecology and epidemiology of tick-borne infections elsewhere needs to be comprehensively investigated.\"'], ['The Spread of Fecally Transmitted Parasites in Socially-Structured Populations,\"By: Nunn, Charles L.; Thrall, Peter H.; Leendertz, Fabian H.; et al.\",PLOS ONE  Volume: 6   Issue: 6     Article Number: e21677   Published: JUN 30 2011,\"Mammals are infected by a wide array of gastrointestinal parasites, including parasites that also infect humans and domesticated animals. Many of these parasites are acquired through contact with infectious stages present in soil, feces or vegetation, suggesting that ranging behavior will have a major impact on their spread. We developed an individual-based spatial simulation model to investigate how range use intensity, home range overlap, and defecation rate impact the spread of fecally transmitted parasites in a population composed of social groups (i.e., a socially structured population). We also investigated the effects of epidemiological parameters involving host and parasite mortality rates, transmissibility, disease-related mortality, and group size. The model was spatially explicit and involved the spillover of a gastrointestinal parasite from a reservoir population along the edge of a simulated reserve, which was designed to mimic the introduction pathogens into protected areas. Animals ranged randomly within a \"\"core\"\" area, with biased movement toward the range center when outside the core. We systematically varied model parameters using a Latin hypercube sampling design. Analyses of simulation output revealed a strong positive association between range use intensity and the prevalence of infection. Moreover, the effects of range use intensity were similar in magnitude to effects of group size, mortality rates, and the per-contact probability of transmission. Defecation rate covaried positively with gastrointestinal parasite prevalence. Greater home range overlap had no positive effects on prevalence, with a smaller core resulting in less range overlap yet more intensive use of the home range and higher prevalence. Collectively, our results reveal that parasites with fecal-oral transmission spread effectively in socially structured populations. Future application should focus on parameterizing the model with empirically derived ranging behavior for different species or populations and data on transmission characteristics of different infectious organisms.\"'], ['Host and viral ecology determine bat rabies seasonality and maintenance,\"By: Georgea, Dylan B.; Webb, Colleen T.; Farnsworth, Matthew L.; et al.\",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  Volume: 108   Issue: 25   Pages: 10208-10213   Published: JUN 21 2011,\"Rabies is an acute viral infection that is typically fatal. Most rabies modeling has focused on disease dynamics and control within terrestrial mammals (e. g., raccoons and foxes). As such, rabies in bats has been largely neglected until recently. Because bats have been implicated as natural reservoirs for several emerging zoonotic viruses, including SARS-like corona viruses, henipaviruses, and lyssaviruses, understanding how pathogens are maintained within a population becomes vital. Unfortunately, little is known about maintenance mechanisms for any pathogen in bat populations. We present a mathematical model parameterized with unique data from an extensive study of rabies in a Colorado population of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) to elucidate general maintenance mechanisms. We propose that life history patterns of many species of temperate-zone bats, coupled with sufficiently long incubation periods, allows for rabies virus maintenance. Seasonal variability in bat mortality rates, specifically low mortality during hibernation, allows long-term bat population viability. Within viable bat populations, sufficiently long incubation periods allow enough infected individuals to enter hibernation and survive until the following year, and hence avoid an epizootic fadeout of rabies virus. We hypothesize that the slowing effects of hibernation on metabolic and viral activity maintains infected individuals and their pathogens until susceptibles from the annual birth pulse become infected and continue the cycle. This research provides a context to explore similar host ecology and viral dynamics that may explain seasonal patterns and maintenance of other bat-borne diseases.\"'], ['Ecological surveillance of small mammals at Dagmar North Training Area, Gyeonggi Province, Republic of Korea, 2001-2005,\"By: Kim, Heung Chul; Klein, Terry A.; Kang, Hae Ji; et al.\",JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY  Volume: 36   Issue: 1   Pages: 42-54   Published: JUN 2011,\"A seasonal rodent-borne disease surveillance program was established at Dagmar North Training Area located near the demilitarized zone, Republic of Korea, from 2001 through 2005. Selected habitats surveyed included earthen banks separating rice paddies, fighting positions along a 5 m rock-faced earthen berm, and extensive tall grasses with various degrees of herbaceous and scrub vegetation associated with dirt roads, rice paddies, ditches, ponds, or the Imjin River. Of the nine species of small mammals captured, the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius), the primary reservoir for Hantaan virus, was the most frequently collected, representing 92.5% of the 1,848 small mammals captured. Males were captured similarly to females during the spring and summer seasons but were captured less frequently during the fall and winter seasons. Gravid rates were highest in the fall (25.5-57.3%) with the lowest rates during the summer (0.0-2.2%). Capture rates were the lowest along earthen banks separating rice paddies (5.5%) and highest in unmanaged tall grasses and crawling vegetation (15.3-43.5%). An increased knowledge of ecological factors that impact the abundance and distribution of small mammals and the associated ectoparasites and pathogens they harbor is critical for developing accurate disease risk assessments and mitigation strategies for preventing vector-and rodent-borne diseases among soldiers training in field environments.

We assessed exposure to these disease vectors by extensively sampling both chiggers and ticks and their small mammal hosts in eastern Taiwan during 2007 and 2008. The striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius Pallas (Rodentia: Muridae) was the most common of the small mammals (36.1% of 1393 captures) and presented the highest rate of infestation with both chiggers (47.8% of 110 760) and ticks (78.1% of 1431). Leptotrombidium imphalum Vercammen-Grandjean & Langston (Trombidiformes: Trombiculidae) and immature Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides Supino (Ixodida: Ixodidae) were the most abundant chiggers (84.5%) and ticks ( 99%) identified, respectively. Immunofluorescent antibody assay revealed high seropositive rates of rodents against Orientia tsutsugamushi Hyashi (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae), the aetiological agent of scrub typhus (70.0% of 437 rodents), and tick-borne SFG rickettsiae (91.9% of 418 rodents). The current study represents a first step towards elucidating the potential hosts and vectors in the enzootic transmission of O. tsutsugamushi and tick-borne SFG rickettsiae in Taiwan. Further studies should focus on characterizing pathogens in L. imphalum and R. haemaphysaloides, as well as the proclivity of both vectors to humans.

Both diseases are endemic in Queensland and have similar clinical symptoms and comparable transmission cycles involving a complex inter-relationship between human hosts, various mosquito vectors, and a range of nonhuman vertebrate hosts, including marsupial mammals that are unique to the Australasian region. Although these viruses are thought to share similar vectors and vertebrate hosts, RRV is four times more prevalent than BFV in Queensland.Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of BFV and RRV human disease notification data collected from 1995 to 2007 in Queensland to ascertain whether there were differences in the incidence patterns of RRV and BFV disease. In particular, we compared the temporal incidence and spatial distribution of both diseases and considered the relationship between their disease dynamics. We also investigated whether a peak in BFV incidence during spring was indicative of the following RRV and BFV transmission season incidence levels.Results: Although there were large differences in the notification rates of the two diseases, they had similar annual temporal patterns, but there were regional variations between the length and magnitude of the transmission seasons. During periods of increased disease activity, however, there was no association between the dynamics of the two diseases.Conclusions: The results from this study suggest that while RRV and BFV share similar mosquito vectors, there are significant differences in the ecology of these viruses that result in different epidemic patterns of disease incidence. Further investigation is required into the ecology of each virus to determine which factors are important in promoting RRV and BFV disease outbreaks.\"'], ['The ecology and emergence of diseases in fresh waters,\"By: Johnson, Pieter T. J.; Paull, Sara H.\",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY  Volume: 56   Issue: 4   Pages: 638-657   Published: APR 2011,\"P1. Freshwater ecosystems, including ponds, lakes, streams and rivers, represent an interaction nexus between environmental change and a wide variety of infectious diseases, including human malaria, salmonid whirling disease, amphibian chytridiomycosis, crayfish plague and many others. However, few studies have explicitly examined patterns of disease in fresh waters and how they are changing over time.2. Freshwater environments can function as transmission foci for pathogens because of (i) the importance of fresh water for organism survival, (ii) the aquatic life histories of many vectors and intermediate hosts, (iii) the concentrated aggregations of species - both freshwater and terrestrial - in and around freshwater habitats and (iv) the highly altered condition of freshwater ecosystems, which can affect species interactions and disease pathology.3. To determine whether water-related diseases in wildlife are increasing, we used generalised additive models to quantitatively assess trends in the scientific literature (1970-2009) for major freshwater groups, including amphibians, molluscs, crayfishes, fishes, mammals, reptiles and birds. We further examined what types of pathogens were primarily responsible for observed patterns and whether recurrent groups or transmission modes could be identified.4. After correcting for research effort and temporal autocorrelation, we find that reports of disease varied over time and across freshwater taxa, with significant increases in amphibians, fishes and crayfishes, a significant decrease in molluscs, and no significant change in freshwater reptiles, birds or mammals. The types and diversity of pathogens varied considerably among groups. Reports of infection in amphibians were dominated by helminths and a chytridiomycete, in crayfishes by viruses and fungi, in molluscs by digenetic trematodes, in birds, fishes and mammals by viruses, protists and helminths and in reptiles by helminths and bacteria.5. These results provide some of the first quantitative evidence indicative of a long-term increase in disease-related research for freshwater taxa. Managing freshwater ecosystems to reduce or minimise human and wildlife disease risk - arguably one of the most significant ecosystem services - will require enhanced incorporation of ecological approaches alongside medical and veterinary tools.\"'], ['Amplification of Emerging Viruses in a Bat Colony,\"By: Drexler, Jan Felix; Corman, Victor Max; Wegner, Tom; et al.\",EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES  Volume: 17   Issue: 3   Pages: 449-456   Published: MAR 2011,\"Bats host noteworthy viral pathogens, including coronaviruses, astroviruses, and adenoviruses. Knowledge on the ecology of reservoir-borne viruses is critical for preventive approaches against zoonotic epidemics. We studied a maternity colony of Myotis myotis bats in the attic of a private house in a suburban neighborhood in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, during 2008, 2009, and 2010. One coronavirus, 6 astroviruses, and 1 novel adenovirus were identified and monitored quantitatively. Strong and specific amplification of RNA viruses, but not of DNA viruses, occurred during colony formation and after parturition. The breeding success of the colony was significantly better in 2010 than in 2008, in spite of stronger amplification of coronaviruses and astroviruses in 2010, suggesting that these viruses had little pathogenic influence on bats. However, the general correlation of virus and bat population dynamics suggests that bats control infections similar to other mammals and that they may well experience epidemics of viruses under certain circumstances.\"'], ['Variation within and among host species in engorgement of larval trombiculid mites,\"By: Kuo, C. -C.; Wang, H. -C.; Huang, C. -L.\",PARASITOLOGY  Volume: 138   Issue: 3   Pages: 344-353   Published: MAR 2011,\"We recovered larval trombiculid mites (i.e. chiggers), vectors of scrub typhus, from small mammal hosts in Taiwan, and compared the relative degree of engorgement (RDE) of the dominant chigger (Leptotrombidium imphalum) from different hosts. Naturally occurring chiggers recovered from Rattus losea and Bandicota indica were 1.4x and 1.3x as engorged as those from Apodemus agrarius. Within each host species, RDE was negatively related to chigger loads, but was mostly unrelated to gender or to body or reproductive condition of hosts. We documented significant variation in chigger engorgement both within and among host species; to the extent that RDE is a proxy for fitness, this contradicts predictions of the Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) that the per capita fitness of vectors should be similar among hosts. Failure to meet predictions of the IFD may reflect the limited mobility of chiggers, which consequently must be less selective in the hosts on which they feed. Further disease control efforts should consider vector feeding success in addition to vector abundance and may be able to capitalize on the unsuitability of certain hosts in supporting disease vectors.\"'], ['European hare (Lepus europaeus) invasion ecology: implication for the conservation of the endemic Irish hare (Lepus timidus hibernicus),\"By: Reid, Neil\",BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS  Volume: 13   Issue: 3   Pages: 559-569   Published: MAR 2011,\"European hare Lepus europaeus populations have undergone recent declines but the species has successfully naturalised in many countries outside its native range. It was introduced to Ireland during the mid-late nineteenth century for field sport and is now well established in Northern Ireland. The native Irish hare Lepus timidus hibernicus is an endemic subspecies of mountain hare L. timidus and has attracted major conservation concern following a long-term population decline during the twentieth century and is one of the highest priority species for conservation action in Ireland. Little is known about the European hare in Ireland or whether it poses a significant threat to the native mountain hare subspecies by compromising its ecological security or genetic integrity. We review the invasion ecology of the European hare and examine evidence for interspecific competition with the mountain hare for habitat space and food resources, interspecific hybridisation, disease and parasite transmission and possible impacts of climate change. We also examine the impact that introduced hares can have on native non-lagomorph species. We conclude that the European hare is an emerging and significant threat to the conservation status of the native Irish hare. Invasive mammal species have been successfully eradicated from Ireland before and immediate action is often the only opportunity for cost-effective eradication.

In this context, organisms must elicit and regulate effective immune responses to protect their health while avoiding immunopathology. However, most of our knowledge about the function and dynamics of immune responses comes from laboratory studies performed on inbred mice in highly controlled environments with limited exposure to infection. Natural populations, on the other hand, exhibit wide genetic and environmental diversity. We argue that now is the time for immunology to be taken into the wild. The goal of \\'wild immunology\\' is to link immune phenotype with host fitness in natural environments. To achieve this requires relevant measures of immune responsiveness that are both applicable to the host-parasite interaction under study and robustly associated with measures of host and parasite fitness. Bringing immunology to nonmodel organisms and linking that knowledge host fitness, and ultimately population dynamics, will face difficult challenges, both technical (lack of reagents and annotated genomes) and statistical (variation among individuals and populations). However, the affordability of new genomic technologies will help immunologists, ecologists and evolutionary biologists work together to translate and test our current knowledge of immune mechanisms in natural systems. From this approach, ecologists will gain new insight into mechanisms relevant to host health and fitness, while immunologists will be given a measure of the real-world health impacts of the immune factors they study. Thus, wild immunology can be the missing link between laboratory-based immunology and human, wildlife and domesticated animal health.\"'], ['Rodent Community Structure and Andes Virus Infection in Sylvan and Peridomestic Habitats in Northwestern Patagonia, Argentina,\"By: Piudo, Luciana; Monteverde, Martin J.; Walker, R.

In zoonoses such as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the presence of a diverse community can dilute the impact of the principal reservoir, reducing risk to humans. The goal of this study was to examine rodent community composition, abundance of Andes virus (ANDV) host (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus), ANDV prevalence, and temporal variability associated with rural peridomestic settings in Patagonia, Argentina. We trapped rodents in peridomestic settings and nearby sylvan areas for 2 years. The numerically dominant species differed between peridomestic and sylvan settings. O. longicaudatus was the most abundant species in peridomestic settings (50% of individuals). Diversity and evenness in peridomestic settings fluctuated temporally, with an abrupt decline in evenness coinciding with peaks in ANDV prevalence. The probability of finding an ANDV-positive mouse in peridomestic settings was 2.44 times greater than in sylvan habitats. Changes in rodent communities in peridomestic settings may increase the probability for human exposure to ANDV because those settings promote the presence of O. longicaudatus with high ANDV antibody prevalence. High O. longicaudatus relative abundance in an unstable community associated with peridomestic settings may favor intraspecific contact, leading to a higher probability of virus transmission.\"'], ['Behavioral and spatial analysis of extraterritorial movements in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes),\"By: Soulsbury, Carl D.; Iossa, Graziella; Baker, Philip J.; et al.\",JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY  Volume: 92   Issue: 1   Pages: 190-199   Published: FEB 16 2011,\"Movements away from the natal or home territory are important to many ecological processes, including gene flow, population regulation, and disease epidemiology, yet quantitative data on these behaviors are lacking. Red foxes exhibit 2 periods of extraterritorial movements: when an individual disperses and when males search neighboring territories for extrapair copulations during the breeding season. Using radiotracking data collected at 5-min interfix intervals, we compared movement parameters, including distance moved, speed of movement, and turning angles, of dispersal and reproductive movements to those made during normal territorial movements; the instantaneous separation distances of dispersing and extraterritorial movements to the movements of resident adults; and the frequency of locations of 95%, 60%, and 30% harmonic mean isopleths of adult fox home territories to randomly generated fox movements. Foxes making reproductive movements traveled farther than when undertaking other types of movement, and dispersal movements were straighter. Reproductive and dispersal movements were faster than territorial movements and also differed in intensity of search and thoroughness. Foxes making dispersal movements avoided direct contact with territorial adults and moved through peripheral areas of territories. The converse was true for reproductive movements. Although similar in some basic characteristics, dispersal and reproductive movements are fundamentally different both behaviorally and spatially and are likely to have different ultimate purposes and contrasting effects on spatial processes such as disease transmission.\"'], ['Spleen mass, body condition, and parasite load in male American mink (Neovison vison),\"By: Schulte-Hostedde, Albrecht I.; Elsasser, Sarah C.\",JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY  Volume: 92   Issue: 1   Pages: 221-226   Published: FEB 16 2011,\"One demand to which organisms must allocate energy for maintenance, growth, and reproduction is the immune system. Because the immune system is energetically costly, spleen size is expected to be condition-dependent. Parasites also can influence spleen size. Parasites draw resources from their host, with consequences for host body condition. Male American mink (Neovison vison) were examined for parasite prevalence, intensity, and richness to test several predictions: individuals in good condition have large spleens; heavily parasitized individuals have large spleens; and heavily parasitized individuals are in poorer condition than individuals with few parasites. Spleen mass was related positively to both body condition and parasite richness, but spleen mass was not associated with prevalence or intensity of individual parasites. Body condition was related weakly to the intensity of parasitism by the giant kidney worm and sinus worm, but otherwise parasite prevalence, intensity, or richness were not associated with body condition. These results are similar to those found in studies of birds, suggesting that comparable processes occur in mammals.\"'], ['The potential effect of exotic Pacific rats Rattus exulans on vectors of scrub typhus,\"By: Kuo, Chi-Chien; Wang, Hsi-Chieh; Huang, Ching-Lun\",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY  Volume: 48   Issue: 1   Pages: 192-198   Published: FEB 2011,\"P1. The role and influence of exotic species in indigenous vector-borne diseases are important but remain understudied. Ascertaining whether disease vectors prefer exotic vs. native hosts has important implications for human health. Moreover, evaluating whether exotic hosts are intrinsically less susceptible to vectors, or whether vector loads can vary with environment, is instructive for possible disease dynamics in the face of range expansion of exotic species. Rattus exulans has recently been recorded for the first time in eastern Taiwan, where scrub typhus is prevalent. We assessed the role of R. exulans as a host for chiggers (larval trombiculid mites), and the degree to which vector loads of R. exulans exhibited spatial variation.2. We deployed live traps in two villages in Taiwan that differed in human population density and in the incidence of scrub typhus. We recovered and tallied chiggers from small mammals, and identified over one-fifth of chiggers from each host to species. Chiggers were assayed for Orientia tsutsugamushi (OT) infection with nested-PCR.3. R. exulans was the most common small mammal species captured (31 center dot 4% total captures), and supported about one-fifth of total chiggers recovered. Leptotrombidium imphalum dominated the chigger assemblage of most native species ( 90%), but Gahrliepia spp. was commonly found in R. exulans (39 center dot 1%). We detected OT in the genus Leptotrombidium (39%) but not in the Gahrliepia. Prevalence and loads of chiggers in R. exulans were about 5x and 17x higher, respectively, in the less densely populated village; a similar trend also occurred with native R. losea.4. Synthesis and applications. Currently, R. exulans appears to play a relatively minor role in supporting chiggers. However, the fact that both prevalence and loads of chiggers in R. exulans vary greatly with environment, along with the abundance of most exotic species and the ecological flexibility of R. exulans, implies a potential health risk as this species expands to areas with more chiggers. Our study suggests that a clearer understanding of interactions among native and exotic hosts and native parasite species can facilitate prediction of the impact of exotic hosts on the dynamics of vector-borne diseases.\"'], ['Intraspecific phenotypic variation in deer: the role of genetic and epigenetic processes,\"By: Flueck, Werner T.; Smith-Flueck, Jo Anne M.\",ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE  Volume: 51   Issue: 4   Pages: 365-374   Published: 2011,\"Intraspecific phenotypic variation (PV) in deer is common, at times impressively diverse, and involves morphology, development, physiology, and behaviour. Until recently considered a nuisance in evolutionary and taxonomic studies, PV has become the primary target to study fossil and extant species. Phenotypes are traditionally interpreted to express primarily interactions of inherited genetic variants. PV certainly originates from different genotypes, but additional PV, referred to as phenotypic plasticity (PP), results from gene expression responsive to environmental conditions and other epigenetic factors. Usage of \\'epigenetics\\' for PP has increased exponentially with 20 316 published papers (Web-of-Science 1990 - May 2010), yet it does not include a single paper on cervids (1900 to the present). During the \\'genomic era\\', the focus was on the primary DNA sequences and variability therein. Recently however, several higher order architectural genomic features were detected which all affect PV.(1) Genes: poli-genic traits; pleiotropic genes; poli-allelic genes; gene dosage (copy number variants, CNV); single nucleotide variance in coding and gene regulatory regions; mtDNA recombinations and paternal mtDNA inheritance.(2) Gene products: pleiotropic gene products; multiple protein structures through alternative splicing; variable gene product reactions due to gene dosage.(3) Gene expression: (i) epigenetic regulation at the DNA, nucleosomal and chromosomal levels; (ii) large-scale genomic structural variation (i.e. CNV imbalance); (iii) transcription factor proteins (TF), each regulating up to 500 target genes, with TF activity varying 7.5-25% among individual humans (exceeding variation in coding DNA by 300-1000x); (iv) non-protein-coding RNA (98.5% of genome) constituting maybe hundreds of thousands RNA signals; (v) gene expression responsive to external and internal environmental variation; (vi) transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (e. g. from ubiquitous non-gametic interactions, genomic imprinting, epistasis, transgenerational gene-diet interactions); (vii) epigenetic stochasticity resulting in random PP. A unique example of labile traits in mammals is the yearly regrowth of a complete appendage, the antler in cervids.Highly complex assortments of genotypes lead to a spectrum of phenotypes, yet the same spectrum can result if a single genotype generates highly complex assortments of epigenotypes. Although DNA is the template for the DNA-RNA-protein paradigm of heredity, it is the coordination and regulation of gene expression that results in wide complexity and diversity seen among individual deer, and per-generation variety of phenotypes available for selection are greater than available genotypes. In conclusion, epigenetic processes have fundamental influences on the great intraspecific PV found in deer, which is reflected in broad ranges of environmental conditions under which they can persist. Deer management and conservation of endangered cervids will benefit from appreciating the large inherent PV among individuals and the immense contribution of epigenetics in all aspects of deer biology and ecology.\"'], ['The Global Mammal Parasite Database: integrating data to examine primate ecology, conservation and infectious disease.,\"By: Nunn, Charles L.; Altizer, Sonia\",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY  Volume: 144   Supplement: 52   Pages: 226-227   Published: 2011,No Abstract Found'], ['Temporal patterns of tick-borne granulocytic anaplasmosis in California,\"By: Rejmanek, Daniel; Nieto, Nathan C.; Barash, Nell; et al.\",TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES  Volume: 2   Issue: 2   Pages: 81-87   Published: 2011,\"Granulocytic anaplasmosis (GA) is a tick-borne emerging infectious disease caused by the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum.

The abundance of different life stages of questing Ixodes pacificus ticks fluctuated seasonally with the number of adults peaking December to February, nymphs peaking May to July, and larvae peaking April to June. Numerous Ixodes tick species were found attached to dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes), chimunks (Tamias spp.), and deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus); however, attached tick larvae on all 3 rodent species were primarily I. pacificus, attached nymphs were primarily I. angustus, and adults were either I. ochotonae, I. spinipalpis, or I. woodi. A. phagocytophilum DNA was detected by PCR in 2.2% (n = 275.95% C.I. = 0.09-4.9) of sampled ticks.

Seropositive animals included woodrats, chipmunks, and deer mice, although only woodrats and chipmunks had PCR-detectable infect ions. Seroprevalence varied temporally among species with the majority of exposed deer mice detected in fall 2006 and the majority of exposed woodrats and chipmunks identified in spring 2007.

Its ecology, or what we know of it, has evolved rapidly in recent years. Two novel species, Brucella ceti and B. pinnipedialis, with the potential for causing human disease have been isolated from marine mammals. Another novel species, B. microti, has been isolated from wildlife animals, whilst B. inopinata has been isolated from a human case. An active spillover of Brucella between domestic animals and wildlife is also being recognised, with elk transmitting B. abortus to cattle, and freshwater fish becoming infected with B. melitensis from waste meat. In recent years the global epidemiology of the disease has not altered drastically, apart from increased awareness of brucellosis in sub-Saharan Africa and a rapid expansion of disease endemicity in the Balkan Peninsula. Isolated stories and events underline that Brucella knows no borders.

Given their impact on human and agricultural health, it is critical to understand the mechanisms underlying immunocompetence in this reservoir host. To date, few studies have examined immune function in the Order Chiroptera, particularly among natural colonies of bats. The phytohemagglutinin (PHA) skin test has been widely used to measure delayed-type cellular immune response in a wide variety of vertebrates, and has been routinely employed in immunoecological studies. Although this test is frequently described as a measure of T cell proliferation, recent studies indicate it may represent a combination of immune responses. In mammals, the immune response is differentially, temporally and spatially regulated, therefore, we characterized the infiltrating leukocyte response to the PHA skin test in bats by examining a time-series of histological sections from PHA and saline injection areas in 41 Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis). Results suggest that bats exhibit diverse leukocyte traffic within 6 h, and up to 24 h following subcutaneous PHA injection. There was a significant presence of lymphocytes and neutrophils, as well as eosinophils, basophils, and macrophages observed in the PHA-injected tissues, compared with saline-injected control tissues. We observed a highly significant negative correlation between the number of lymphocytes and neutrophils in PHA-injected tissue, with peak lymphocyte response at 12 h, and peak neutrophil response at 24 h post-injection. These results indicate substantial variation in the immune response of individuals, and may aid our understanding of disease emergence in natural populations of bats.\"'], ['Forest legislative changes and their impacts on mammal ecology and diversity in Brazil,\"By: Galetti, Mauro; Pardini, Renata; Barbanti Duarte, Jose Mauricio; et al.\",BIOTA NEOTROPICA  Volume: 10   Issue: 4   Special Issue: SI   Pages: 47-52   Published: OCT-DEC 2010,\"Forest ecosystems within Brazil host one of the highest levels of mammalian diversity on Earth, much of which within legally required forest set-asides in private landholdings. The Legal Reserves (RLs) and Permanent Protected Areas (APPs) of the Brazilian Forest Code provide an important strategy to maintain this diversity. Yet a proposed amendment to Brazil\\'s 1965 forestry code would reduce protection of Brazil\\'s forests, including the Amazon and the Atlantic forest, and bring irreversible detrimental effects to mammal diversity. Mammals are key components of forest ecosystem, providing important environmental services as pollinators, seed dispersers and ecosystem engineers. The local extinction of some species will negatively affect forest ecosystem service provisioning throughout the country. Another important effect of forest conversion within private properties, should the proposed changes happen, will be the emergence of new diseases, bringing serious public health problems in Brazil.\"'], ['Phylogenetic and Molecular Characterization of H9N2 Influenza Isolates from Chickens in Northern China from 2007-2009,\"By: Bi, Jianmin; Deng, Guangcun; Dong, Jun; et al.\",PLOS ONE  Volume: 5   Issue: 9     Article Number: e13063   Published: SEP 29 2010,\"The repeated transmission to pigs and humans, and the long-term endemicity in terrestrial poultry of H9N2 viruses in China lend urgency to the study of their ecology and pathogenicity. In the present paper, we reported an H9N2 virus sublineage isolated from chickens in northern China from 2007 to 2009 has high lethality for mice. Phylogenetic analysis of the full genome indicated that six representative H9N2 isolates shared high homology to each other, and they clustered in the same sublineage with other H9N2 viruses isolated recently in northern China. The isolates were double-reassortant viruses containing M genes similar to A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (H9N2) and the other seven gene segments from A/Chicken/Shanghai/F/98 (H9N2). These six isolates were capable of replicating in the lungs of infected chickens without producing observable clinical signs of disease or death. However, they were highly lethal to mice with mortality rates as high as 100% (14/14) without prior adaptation. The affected mice exhibited severe respiratory syndromes and diffuse lung injury. The H9N2 viruses could be detected in multiple organs of the infected mice, including hearts, livers, spleens, lungs and kidneys. Our findings demonstrated that H9N2 viruses isolated from the chickens in northern China have established a stable sublineage with enhanced pathogenicity to mice, suggesting that urgent attention will need to be paid to the transmission of H9N2 viruses from chickens to mammals.\"'], ['Ecological factors driving the long-term evolution of influenza\\'s host range,\"By: Cobey, Sarah; Pascual, Mercedes; Dieckmann, Ulf\",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES  Volume: 277   Issue: 1695   Pages: 2803-2810   Published: SEP 22 2010,\"The evolution of a pathogen\\'s host range is shaped by the ecology of its hosts and by the physiological traits that determine host specificity. For many pathogen traits, there is a trade-off: a phenotype suitable for infecting one set of hosts poorly infects another. Introducing and analysing a simple evo-epidemiological model, here we study how such a trade-off is expected to affect evolution of the host ranges of influenza viruses. We examine a quantitative trait underlying host specificity, given by an influenza virus\\'s degree of adaptation to certain conformations of sialic acid receptors, and investigate how this receptor preference evolves in a minimal network of host species, including humans, that differ in life history and receptor physiology. Using adaptive dynamics theory, we establish thresholds in interspecific transmission rates and host population sizes that govern the emergence and persistence of human-adapted viruses. These ecological thresholds turn out to be largely independent of the strength of the evolutionary trade-off, underscoring the importance of ecological conditions in determining a disease\\'s host range.\"'], ['Global drivers of human pathogen richness and prevalence,\"By: Dunn, Robert R.; Davies, T.

The relative contributions of different factors to these patterns, however, have not been fully resolved. We conduct a global analysis of the relative influence of climate, alternative host diversity and spending on disease prevention on modern patterns in the richness and prevalence of human pathogens. Pathogen richness (number of kinds) is largely explained by the number of birds and mammal species in a region. The most diverse countries with respect to birds and mammals are also the most diverse with respect to pathogens. Importantly, for human health, the prevalence of key human pathogens (number of cases) is strongly influenced by disease control efforts. As a consequence, even where disease richness is high, we might still control prevalence, particularly if we spend money in those regions where current spending is low, prevalence is high and populations are large.\"'], ['Absence of domestic triatomine colonies in an area of the coastal region of Ecuador where Chagas disease is endemic,\"By: Grijalva, Mario J.; Palomeque, Francisco S.; Villacis, Anita G.; et al.\",MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ  Volume: 105   Issue: 5   Pages: 677-681   Published: AUG 2010,\"Rhodnius ecuadoriensis is considered the second most important vector of Chagas disease in Ecuador. It is distributed across six of the 24 provinces and occupies intradomiciliary, peridomiciliary and sylvatic habitats. This study was conducted in six communities within the coastal province of Guayas. Triatomine searches were conducted in domestic and peridomestic habitats and bird nests using manual searches, live-bait traps and sensor boxes. Synantrhopic mammals were captured in the domestic and peridomestic habitats. Household searches (n = 429) and randomly placed sensor boxes (n = 360) produced no live triatomine adults or nymphs. In contrast, eight nymphs were found in two out of six searched Campylorhynchus fasciatus (Troglodytidae) nests. Finally, Trypanosoma cruzi DNA was amplified from the blood of 10% of the 115 examined mammals. Environmental changes in land use (intensive rice farming), mosquito control interventions and lack of intradomestic adaptation are suggested among the possible reasons for the lack of domestic triatomine colonies.\"'], ['A Major Role for Mammals in the Ecology of Mycobacterium ulcerans,\"By: Fyfe, Janet A. M.; Lavender, Caroline J.; Handasyde, Kathrine A.; et al.\",PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES  Volume: 4   Issue: 8     Article Number: e791   Published: AUG 2010,\"Background: Mycobacterium ulcerans is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer (BU), a destructive skin disease found predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa and south-eastern Australia. The precise mode(s) of transmission and environmental reservoir(s) remain unknown, but several studies have explored the role of aquatic invertebrate species. The purpose of this study was to investigate the environmental distribution of M. ulcerans in south-eastern Australia.Methodology/Principal Findings: A range of environmental samples was collected from Point Lonsdale (a small coastal town southwest of Melbourne, Australia, endemic for BU) and from areas with fewer or no reported incident cases of BU. Mycobacterium ulcerans DNA was detected at low levels by real-time PCR in soil, sediment, water residue, aquatic plant biofilm and terrestrial vegetation collected in Point Lonsdale. Higher levels of M. ulcerans DNA were detected in the faeces of common ringtail (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) and common brushtail (Trichosurus vulpecula) possums. Systematic testing of possum faeces revealed that M. ulcerans DNA could be detected in 41% of faecal samples collected in Point Lonsdale compared with less than 1% of faecal samples collected from non-endemic areas (p0.0001). Capture and clinical examination of live possums in Point Lonsdale validated the accuracy of the predictive value of the faecal surveys by revealing that 38% of ringtail possums and 24% of brushtail possums had laboratory-confirmed M. ulcerans skin lesions and/or M. ulcerans PCR positive faeces. Whole genome sequencing revealed an extremely close genetic relationship between human and possum M. ulcerans isolates.Conclusions/Significance: The prevailing wisdom is that M. ulcerans is an aquatic pathogen and that BU is acquired by contact with certain aquatic environments (swamps, slow-flowing water). Now, after 70 years of research, we propose a transmission model for BU in which terrestrial mammals are implicated as reservoirs for M. ulcerans.\"'], ['Ecology of Hantaviruses and Their Hosts in North America,\"By: Mills, James N.; Amman, Brian R.; Glass, Gregory E.\",VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES  Volume: 10   Issue: 6   Pages: 563-574   Published: AUG 2010,\"Since the 1993 discovery of a highly pathogenic hantavirus associated with the North American deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), intensive ecological studies have led to many advances in our understanding of the natural history of New World hantaviruses as it relates to human disease.

The marmosets Callithrix penicillata and Callithrix jacchus and hybrids of these two species have been introduced to privately owned forests in the lowland Atlantic forest of the Rio de Janeiro State in Brazil, the region of occurrence of the endangered golden lion tamarin, Leontopithecus rosalia. Because the ecology and biology of the marmosets and tamarins is similar, there is a reasonable risk that the marmosets would transmit pathogens such as endo parasites. The objective of this study was to identify the helminth fauna present in the introduced marmosets through an analysis of fecal samples of wild caught animals, and to evaluate the parasitological profile according to age, sex and geographical location. Eggs belonging to the Acanthocephala and Nematoda were found in the feces. One nematode egg type was identified as being Primasubulura jacchi. The ocurrence of nematodes was higher in males, acanthocephala were found in all age groups and sexes and P. jacchi was found with higher frequency in adult females. The geographic distribution analysis revealed that some of the forests had a higher predominance of parasites. Little is known about the pathology of parasites in free living Neotropical mammals, and this knowledge would be necessary to infer about the risk (form a parasitological standpoint) that the marmoset presence represents for the survival of the endangered golden lion tamarin.

We used a panel of microsatellite DNA markers, radiotelemetry data, and visual observations of marked deer to study fine-scale social and genetic structure in a high-density population of white-tailed deer (12-20 deer/km(2)). We collected genetic data on 229 adult females, 102 of which were assigned to 28 social groups. Our results were consistent with the conceptual model of white-tailed deer social structure, where philopatric females form social groups composed of related individuals. Within-group relatedness values approached the expected value for 1st cousins (R = 0.103, SE = 0.033), but individuals among groups (R = 0.014, SE = 0.003) and overall (R = -0.009, SE = 0.003) were unrelated. Fixation indices revealed a significant departure from equilibrium values among social groups (F(ST) = 0.076, SE = 0.007) and an excess of heterozygotes within groups (F(ls) = 0.050, SE = 0.018), consistent with theoretical expectations for mammal populations characterized by female philopatry and a polygynous mating system. Analyses of spatial autocorrelation indicated genetic structuring occurred at a very fine spatial scale, where pairs of adult females within 1 km were genetically nonindependent. The occurrence of fine-scale genetic and social structure has implications for the ecology and management of white-tailed deer, including habitat use and resource competition, offspring sex allocation theories, disease transmission, and the consideration of social behaviors in management.

Furthermore, in the wild, white horses suffer a larger predation risk than dark individuals because they can more easily be detected. In spite of their greater vulnerability, white horses have been highly appreciated for centuries owing to their natural rarity. Here, we show that blood-sucking tabanid flies, known to transmit disease agents to mammals, are less attracted to white than dark horses. We also demonstrate that tabanids use reflected polarized light from the coat as a signal to find a host. The attraction of tabanids to mainly black and brown fur coats is explained by positive polarotaxis. As the host\\'s colour determines its attractiveness to tabanids, this parameter has a strong influence on the parasite load of the host. Although we have studied only the tabanid horse interaction, our results can probably be extrapolated to other host animals of polarotactic tabanids, as the reflection-polarization characteristics of the host\\'s body surface are physically the same, and thus not species-dependent.\"'], ['Plague studies in California: a review of long-term disease activity, flea-host relationships and plague ecology in the coniferous forests of the Southern Cascades and northern Sierra Nevada mountains,\"By: Smith, Charles R.; Tucker, James R.; Wilson, Barbara A.; et al.\",JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY  Volume: 35   Issue: 1   Pages: 1-12   Published: JUN 2010,\"We review 28 years of long-term surveillance (1970-1997) for plague activity among wild rodents from ten locations within three coniferous forest habitat types in the northern Sierra Nevada and the Southern Cascade mountains of northeastern California. We identify rodent hosts and their fleas and document long-term plague activity in each habitat type. The highest seroprevalence for Yersinia pestis occurred in the chipmunks, Tamias senex and T. quadrimaculatus, and the pine squirrel, Tamiasciurus douglasii. The most commonly infected fleas were Ceratophyllus ciliatus and Eumolpianus eumolpi from chipmunks and Oropsylla montana and O. idahoensis from ground squirrels. Serological surveillance demonstrated that populations of T. senex, T. quadrimaculatus and T. douglasii are moderately resistant to plague, survive infection, and are, therefore, good sentinels for plague activity. Recaptured T. senex and T. quadrimaculatus showed persistence of plague antibodies and evidence of re-infection over a two year period. These rodent species, their fleas, and the ecological factors common to the coniferous forest habitats likely promote the maintenance of plague foci in northeastern California.

C.; Do Linh San, E.; Pope, L. C.; et al.\",HEREDITY  Volume: 104   Issue: 5   Pages: 493-501   Published: MAY 2010,\"Understanding the dispersal behaviour of a species is important for understanding its ecology and evolution. Dispersal in the Eurasian badger (Meles meles) is believed to be very limited, with social groups forming primarily through the retention of offspring. However, most of our knowledge of dispersal in this species comes from studies of high-density populations in the United Kingdom, where badgers are atypical in their behaviour, physiology, ecology and prey specialization. In this study we use genetic methods to compare dispersal patterns in a British and a Swiss population that differ in their ecology and demography. We present well-supported evidence that badgers disperse much further in the low-density continental population, where dispersal may also be female biased. Limited dispersal thus seems not to be an intrinsic behavioural characteristic of the species. Rather, dispersal patterns seem to vary depending on population demography and, ultimately, habitat quality and characteristics. This could have important management consequences, as dispersal can affect the impact of local extinction, and host dispersal has a particularly important role in disease transmission. Even though concentrated studies of a species in a single location may not provide representative data for the species, there are few mammalian studies that compare demography and dispersal patterns across contrasting habitats. Our results provide an example of phenotypic plasticity and suggest that dispersal is determined by the interaction of individual, social and environmental factors that may differ between populations.

It has long been recognized that birds and bats are characterized by lower rates of extrinsic mortality and greater longevities than nonvolant endotherms, presumably because flight reduces exposure to terrestrial predators, disease, and environmental hazards. Like flight, arboreality may act to reduce extrinsic mortality, delay senescence, and increase longevity and has been suggested as an explanation for the long lifespans of primates. However, this hypothesis has yet to be tested in mammals in general. We analyze a large dataset of mammalian longevity records to test whether arboreal mammals are characterized by greater longevities than terrestrial mammals. Here, we show that arboreal mammals are longer lived than terrestrial mammals at common body sizes, independent of phylogeny. Subclade analyses demonstrate that this trend holds true in nearly every mammalian subgroup, with two notable exceptions-metatherians (marsupials) and euarchontans (primates and their close relatives). These subgroups are unique in that each has experienced a long and persistent arboreal evolutionary history, with subsequent transitions to terrestriality occurring multiple times within each group. In all other clades examined, terrestriality appears to be the primitive condition, and species that become arboreal tend to experience increased longevity, often independently in multiple lineages within each clade. Adoption of an arboreal lifestyle may have allowed for increased longevity in these lineages and in primates in general. Overall, these results confirm the fundamental predictions of the evolutionary theory of aging.\"'], ['Avian Influenza Virus Surveillance and Wild Birds: Past and Present,\"By: Krauss, Scott; Webster, Robert G.\",AVIAN DISEASES  Volume: 54   Issue: 1   Supplement: S   Pages: 394-398   Published: MAR 2010,\"Influenza surveillance in wild birds has established that the aquatic birds of the world are the source of influenza A viruses, which occasionally spread to domestic avian species and to mammals, including humans, and cause mild to severe disease.

A 5-year study was undertaken to investigate hypothesized coinvasion of I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi in Lower Michigan. We tracked the spatial and temporal dynamics of the tick and spirochete using mammal, bird, and vegetation drag sampling at eight field sites along coastal and inland transects originating in a zone of recent I. scapularis establishment. We document northward invasion of these ticks along Michigan\\'s west coast during the study period; this pattern was most evident in ticks removed from rodents. B. burgdorferi infection prevalences in I. scapularis sampled from vegetation in the invasion zone were 9.3% and 36.6% in nymphs and adults, respectively, with the majority of infection (95.1%) found at the most endemic site. There was no evidence of I. scapularis invasion along the inland transect; however, low-prevalence B. burgdorferi infection was detected in other tick species and in wildlife at inland sites, and at northern coastal sites in years before the arrival of I. scapularis. These infections suggest that cryptic B. burgdorferi transmission by other vector-competent tick species is occurring in the absence of I. scapularis. Other Borrelia spirochetes, including those that group with B. miyamotoi and B. andersonii, were present at a low prevalence within invading ticks and local wildlife. Reports of Lyme disease have increased significantly in the invasion zone in recent years. This rapid blacklegged tick invasion-measurable within 5 years-in combination with cryptic pathogen maintenance suggests a complex ecology of Lyme disease emergence in which wildlife sentinels can provide an early warning of disease emergence.\"'], ['Mosquito distribution and Japanese encephalitis virus infection in the immigration bird (Asian open-billed stork) nested area in Pathum Thani province, central Thailand,\"By: Tiawsirisup, Sonthaya; Nuchprayoon, Surang\",PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH  Volume: 106   Issue: 4   Pages: 907-910   Published: MAR 2010,\"Japanese encephalitis virus infection is a mosquito-borne emerging or re-emerging infectious disease in several countries.

Genomic studies have shown that the F. tularensis has been undergoing genomic decay with the most virulent strains having the lowest number of functional genes. Entry of F. tularensis into macrophages is mediated by looping phagocytosis and is associated with signalling through Syk tyrosine kinase. Within macrophages and arthropod-derived cells, the Francisella-containing phagosome matures transiently into an acidified late endosome-like phagosome with limited fusion to lysosomes followed by rapid bacterial escape into the cytosol within 30-60 min, and bacterial proliferation within the cytosol. The Francisella pathogenicity island, which potentially encodes a putative type VI secretion system, is essential for phagosome biogenesis and bacterial escape into the cytosol within macrophages and arthropod-derived cells. Initial sensing of F. tularensis in the cytosol triggers IRF-3-dependent IFN-beta secretion, type I IFNR-dependent signalling, activation of the inflammasome mediated by caspase-1, and a pro-inflammatory response, which is suppressed by triggering of SHIP.

The ecology of small mammals inhabiting semiarid Chile is strongly affected by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During La Nina events in this area, dry conditions prevail and species may disappear from the thorn-scrub habitat. Conversely, El Nino events bring high rainfall, and associated pulses of food trigger small-mammal population increases. We used capture-mark-recapture to study responses of the degu (Octodon degus), a dominant small mammal, to variation in rainfall over 18 years. In response to a recent trend toward wetter conditions, degus reached record-high densities and maintained more stable numbers in the area. Underlying mechanisms involved variation in adult survival, juvenile persistence, and fecundity linked to rainfall changes during consecutive years (i.e., rainfall phases). During prolonged droughts, degus had low survival and produced fewer offspring, with low persistence. Following high rainfall, these parameters reversed; consecutive wet years resulted in further increases. Weak declines in fecundity and adult survival and high persistence of juveniles explained delayed responses to deteriorating conditions in initial dry years. If GCC leads to increased frequency of El Nino events, we anticipate greater numerical dominance of degus in semiarid Chile and possible range expansion. Furthermore, degus have strong impacts on other small mammal and some plant species, are important prey species, and are agricultural pests and disease reservoirs. Hence, GCC has the potential to dramatically influence their ecology in northern Chile and to have cascading effects on other components of this system.\"'], ['Blood feeding patterns of mosquitoes: random or structured?,\"By: Chaves, Luis F.; Harrington, Laura C.; Keogh, Carolyn L.; et al.\",FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY  Volume: 7     Article Number: 3   Published: JAN 21 2010,\"Background: The foraging behavior of blood-sucking arthropods is the defining biological event shaping the transmission cycle of vector-borne parasites. It is also a phenomenon that pertains to the realm of community ecology, since blood-feeding patterns of vectors can occur across a community of vertebrate hosts. Although great advances in knowledge of the genetic basis for blood-feeding choices have been reported for selected vector species, little is known about the role of community composition of vertebrate hosts in determining such patterns.Methods & Results: Here, we present an analysis of feeding patterns of vectors across a variety of locations, looking at foraging patterns of communities of mosquitoes, across communities of hosts primarily comprised of mammals and birds. Using null models of species co-occurrence, which do not require ancillary information about host abundance, we found that blood-feeding patterns were aggregated in studies from multiple sites, but random in studies from a single site. This combination of results supports the idea that mosquito species in a community may rely primarily on host availability in a given landscape, and that contacts with specific hosts will be influenced more by the presence/absence of hosts than by innate mosquito choices. This observation stresses the importance of blood-feeding plasticity as a key trait explaining the emergence of many zoonotic mosquito transmitted diseases.Discussion: From an epidemiological perspective our observations support the idea that phenomena promoting synchronization of vectors and hosts can promote the emergence of vector-borne zoonotic diseases, as suggested by observations on the linkages between deforestation and the emergence of several human diseases.\"'], ['Contributions of Francisella tularensis subsp novicida Chitinases and Sec Secretion System to Biofilm Formation on Chitin,\"By: Margolis, Jeffrey J.; El-Etr, Sahar; Joubert, Lydia-Marie; et al.\",APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY  Volume: 76   Issue: 2   Pages: 596-608   Published: JAN 15 2010,\"Francisella tularensis, the zoonotic cause of tularemia, can infect numerous mammals and other eukaryotes. Although studying F. tularensis pathogenesis is essential to comprehending disease, mammalian infection is just one step in the ecology of Francisella species. F. tularensis has been isolated from aquatic environments and arthropod vectors, environments in which chitin could serve as a potential carbon source and as a surface for attachment and growth. We show that F. tularensis subsp. novicida forms biofilms during the colonization of chitin surfaces. The ability of F. tularensis to persist using chitin as a sole carbon source is dependent on chitinases, since mutants lacking chiA or chiB are attenuated for chitin colonization and biofilm formation in the absence of exogenous sugar. A genetic screen for biofilm mutants identified the Sec translocon export pathway and 14 secreted proteins. We show that these genes are important for initial attachment during biofilm formation. We generated defined deletion mutants by targeting two chaperone genes (secB1 and secB2) involved in Sec-dependent secretion and four genes that encode putative secreted proteins. All of the mutants were deficient in attachment to polystyrene and chitin surfaces and for biofilm formation compared to wild-type F. novicida. In contrast, mutations in the Sec translocon and secreted factors did not affect virulence. Our data suggest that biofilm formation by F. tularensis promotes persistence on chitin surfaces. Further study of the interaction of F. tularensis with the chitin microenvironment may provide insight into the environmental survival and transmission mechanisms of this pathogen.\"'], ['Update on Powassan Virus: Emergence of a North American Tick-Borne Flavivirus,\"By: Ebel, Gregory D.\",ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENTOMOLOGY  Book Series: Annual Review of Entomology   Volume: 55   Pages: 95-110   Published: 2010,\"Powassan virus (POW (Flaviviridae: Flavivirus) is the cause of rare but severe neuroinvasive disease in North America and Russia.

Previously studied mammalian astroviruses have been associated with diarrhoeal disease. Knowledge of astrovirus diversity is very limited, with only six officially recognized astrovirus species from mammalian hosts and, in addition, one human and some bat astroviruses were recently described. We used consensus PCR techniques for initial identification of five astroviruses of marine mammals: three from California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), one from a Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) and one from a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). Bayesian and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic; analysis found that these viruses showed significant diversity at a level consistent with novel species. Astroviruses that we identified from marine mammals were found across the mamastrovirus tree and did not form a monophyletic group. Recombination analysis found that a recombination event may have occurred between a human and a California sea lion astrovirus, suggesting that both lineages may have been capable of infecting the same host at one point. The diversity found amongst marine mammal astroviruses and their similarity to terrestrial astroviruses suggests that the marine environment plays an important role in astrovirus ecology.\"'], ['Survival and fidelity of an enclosed white-tailed deer population using capture-recapture-reporting data,\"By: Webb, Stephen L.; Gee, Kenneth L.; Wang, Guiming\",POPULATION ECOLOGY  Volume: 52   Issue: 1   Pages: 81-88   Published: JAN 2010,\"The number of animal populations enclosed by impermeable fences has increased, which poses issues related to the behavior of individuals and populations. Despite the increased number of fenced enclosures, there is a paucity of survival and fidelity data on white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from fenced enclosures. Therefore, we examined marked deer recaptures and resightings over 13 years for an enclosed population of white-tailed deer in Oklahoma, USA, to estimate survival and fidelity parameters. We found that a step model was the best model of survival for both sexes. Survival of females and males was greater after hunting was suspended. Average female survival was 77% before hunting was suspended but increased to 98% after. Male survival was also greater after (99%) hunting was suspended compared to before (58%). Females exhibited greater site fidelity (84-94%) than males for all age groups except old individuals, which showed similar site fidelities for males and females. Fidelity was highest for old males (85%), followed by adult (74%), fawn (61%), and yearling males (56%). Our high-tensile electric fence allowed management goals to be achieved through increased survival while potentially maintaining genetic diversity through the exchange of limited numbers of individuals from surrounding areas. However, if the goal is to confine deer to limit disease spread or protect sensitive areas (e.g., airports) from deer encroachment, then other fence designs may be necessary, because our fence was not completely effective at controlling deer movements for these purposes.\"'], ['The effects of parasitism on recapture rates of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus),\"By: Coltherd, Jennifer C.; Morgan, Carys; Judge, Johanna; et al.\",WILDLIFE RESEARCH  Volume: 37   Issue: 5   Pages: 413-417   Published: 2010,\"Context. In studies of population dynamics, disease ecology and prevalence, point-sampling of data is a widely used sampling technique and capture-mark-recapture (CMR) is the most popular method of point sampling. Population estimates based on CMR are sensitive to deviations from the assumptions of the models such as equal catchability of all animals. Although consistent deviations from these assumptions can be accounted for in a robust statistical framework (e. g. identification of trap-shy animals), transient effects cannot be adequately incorporated in the statistical models and thus are expected to affect the accuracy of model predictions. In natural animal populations, parasitism is often transient but inevitable and studies showing behavioural changes, e. g. foraging strategies, as a result of infection are numerous. Thus, parasitism may represent a transient source of heterogeneity of trapping probability in small mammal populations and may affect accuracy of wildlife sampling techniques.Aims. The aim of the present study was to quantify the effect of parasitic status on capture rates of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus), and thus the potential for parasitism to act as a source of bias in wildlife sampling techniques such as CMR.Methods. In total, 41 wood mice were successfully captured, marked and released from two study sites in two different years, with weight, sex and faecal egg counts (FEC; used as a measure of the level of parasitism) recorded at every capture.Key results. In both studies, FEC was positively correlated with the capture rate of mice and the number of different traps in which an individual was caught.Conclusions. We conclude that parasitism affects the rate of capture of wood mice and has the potential to represent a significant source of heterogeneity in trapping probability.Implications. The consistent results of these two small studies suggest that wildlife point-sampling techniques may be biased by the parasitic status of the animals, which has potentially significant and far-reaching implications for wildlife population studies and disease-prevalence studies.\"'], ['Ecology of hantavirus in a changing world,\"By: Dearing, M. Denise; Dizney, Laurie\",\"Edited by: Ostfeld, RS; Schlesinger, WH\",\"Hantavirus is a genus of virus represented by 45 different species and is hosted by small mammals, predominantly rats and mice. Roughly, half of all hantaviruses cause diseases in humans that vary in morbidity from mild to severe. The natural and anthropogenic changes occurring in the environment appear to be impacting the ecology of hantaviruses and their natural hosts as well as the incidence of hantaviral diseases in humans. Although such studies are limited at this time, there is evidence that natural climate cycles such as El Nino as well as anthropogenic climate change enhance hantavirus prevalence when host population dynamics are driven by food availability. Climate appears to have less of an effect on hantavirus when host populations are controlled by predators. Human alteration to the landscape also appears to enhance hantavirus prevalence when the disturbance regime enriches the environment for the host, for example, agriculture. More long-term studies on multiple species of hantavirus are needed to accurately predict the outcome of changing environmental conditions on prevalence in hosts as well as disease incidence in humans.\"'], ['Micro-scale distribution of rabbits on Fuerteventura Island,\"By: Lopez-Darias, Marta; Miguel Lobo, Jorge\",BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION  Volume: 18   Issue: 14   Pages: 3687-3704   Published: DEC 2009,\"The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a conservation and social dilemma in the Canary Islands. It is the main prey of endangered species, it causes severe impacts on vegetation, as well as has a considerable hunting economic value but damages agriculture. We assessed drivers of European rabbit habitat selection on Fuerteventura Island (Canary Islands, Spain) in order to understand the ecology and to contribute with data for managing this introduced species. To measure rabbit abundance, we counted the total number of fresh pellets and latrines. We used Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to analyze the relationship between rabbit abundance and four groups of variables that represented the biological requirements of the species (environmental, food resources, refuges/shelters, and biological interactions). Hierarchical partitioning techniques were used to estimate the explanatory capacity of these different groups of variables. Our model better explained fresh pellet abundance (89% of total deviance) than latrine abundance (57%). Variables related to food resources best explained the abundance of both latrines and pellets. We identified a set of plant species highly correlated with rabbit abundance, which probably makes up the species\\' diet. Variables relating to refuge/shelter and the environmental were also relevant. Interactions with other mammals did not strongly affect rabbit abundance on Fuerteventura Island. Mean annual precipitation and temperature were variables that individually best explained abundance, although half of their relevance is shared with others non-environmental variables. Our results provide policy makers and land-managers with applied information on the relationship between rabbit populations and micro-scale components of Fuerteventura.\"'], ['Correlates of Viral Richness in Bats (Order Chiroptera),\"By: Turmelle, Amy S.; Olival, Kevin J.\",ECOHEALTH  Volume: 6   Issue: 4   Pages: 522-539   Published: DEC 2009,\"Historic and contemporary host ecology and evolutionary dynamics have profound impacts on viral diversity, virulence, and associated disease emergence. Bats have been recognized as reservoirs for several emerging viral pathogens, and are unique among mammals in their vagility, potential for long-distance dispersal, and often very large, colonial populations. We investigate the relative influences of host ecology and population genetic structure for predictions of viral richness in relevant reservoir species. We test the hypothesis that host geographic range area, distribution, population genetic structure, migratory behavior, International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) threat status, body mass, and colony size, are associated with known viral richness in bats. We analyze host traits and viral richness in a generalized linear regression model framework, and include a correction for sampling effort and phylogeny. We find evidence that sampling effort, IUCN status, and population genetic structure correlate with observed viral species richness in bats, and that these associations are independent of phylogeny. This study is an important first step in understanding the mechanisms that promote viral richness in reservoir species, and may aid in predicting the emergence of viral zoonoses from bats.\"'], ['Coevolution between multiple helminth infestations and basal immune investment in mammals: cumulative effects of polyparasitism?,\"By: Bordes, Frederic; Morand, Serge\",PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH  Volume: 106   Issue: 1   Pages: 33-37   Published: DEC 2009,\"Animals often suffer from multiple parasite attacks in natural conditions (i.e., polyparasitism). The community of these parasites, which simultaneously or sequentially infest given host species, has rarely been investigated as a parasitic pressure per se. From this perspective, and despite the impressive number of immunoecological or comparative studies, the impacts of polyparasitism on immune responses are far from being appreciated. Focusing on helminths across a wide range of mammalian species and using a phylogenetic comparative method, we show, for the first time, that an increase in the number of helminth parasite species is positively correlated with an increase in basal immune investment (estimated by the counts of white blood cells) across mammal species. After discussing inherent limits of this comparative approach, we put this result in the evolutionary perspective of multiple parasitic infestations.\"'], ['Dryland Salinity and the Ecology of Ross River Virus: The Ecological Underpinnings of the Potential for Transmission,\"By: Carver, Scott; Spafford, Helen; Storey, Andrew; et al.\",VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES  Volume: 9   Issue: 6   Pages: 611-622   Published: DEC 2009,\"Alterations in transmission of vector-borne zoonoses are often linked to environmental change. However, ecological processes that determine variability in potential for transmission are generally not well understood. Ross River virus (RRV, Togoviridae: Alphavirus) is a mosquito-borne zoonosis in Australia with a significant human disease burden. The inland southwest (Wheatbelt) of Western Australia (WA) is substantially affected by an anthropogenic salinization of agricultural land (dryland salinity). Aedes camptorhynchus Thomson (Diptera: Culicidae) is the dominant vector of RRV in southwest WA and is halophilic. As such, dryland salinity may influence potential for RRV transmission by influencing interactions between Ae. camptorhynchus and mammalian hosts. We surveyed areas of the Wheatbelt with varying salinity impacts and found Ae. camptorhynchus was more abundant in saline areas, whereas sheep Ovis aries (Linnaeus 1758, Bovidae) declined with increasing salinity. We used a deterministic model to examine interactions between Ae. camptorhynchus and mammals, and we assessed potential for RRV transmission. We found variation in potential for RRV transmission was positively related to increasing salinity and abundance of Ae. camptorhynchus and negatively associated with increasing abundance of Macropus fuliginosus (Desmarest 1817, Macropodidae). Abundance of Ae. camptorhynchus determined more variation in potential for RRV transmission than other variables. Accordingly, dryland salinity increases the zoonotic potential for RRV transmission primarily by facilitating abundance of Ae. camptorhynchus. Human RRV notifications do not currently reflect the salinity-RRV transmission potential in the Wheatbelt but appear to be associated with RRV activity in the enzootic coastal zone. We speculate dryland salinity is a determinant of potential for RRV transmission but not activity. Dryland salinity is predicted to expand two-to four-fold by 2050. Preservation and restoration of freshwater ecosystems may ameliorate the potential for transmission of RRV and possibly incidence of human disease.\"'], ['Cryptic diversity and cryptic ecology: bats are special within the class Mammalia,\"By: Voigt, Christian C.\",BERLINER UND MUNCHENER TIERARZTLICHE WOCHENSCHRIFT  Volume: 122   Issue: 11-12   Pages: 479-480   Published: NOV-DEC 2009,\"Research of the past decades has brought to light the fundamental importance of bats as a reservoir for many zoonotic diseases (e. g. Field et al., 2001; Fooks et al., 2003). Since then numerous studies have dealt with the factors that make bat transmitted pathogens so infectious. By contrast, almost nothing is known about why bats in particular are predisposed to carry pathogens relevant for human health. The most obvious reason for this lack of knowledge is the cryptic lifestyle of bats. In my talk I will present the most recent discoveries regarding the diversity taxonomy and ecology of this important, but less studied order of mammals.Bats include approximately 1,200 species and therefore represent the second largest order within Mammalia, only outnumbered by rodents (Nowak, 1994). Molecular studies of the past two decades have revealed a very high degree of cryptic diversity among Chiroptera, i.e. morphologically almost identical species appear to have species status based on genetic data. For example, several species of bats have been discovered in Europe within the last few years (Mayer und von Helversen, 2002). Considering that bat assemblages of the tropics harbor many more species than those of the temperate zone, one can only imagine that the true species richness of Chiroptera is yet to be discovered.Previous phylogenies separate two major clades within the Chiroptera: megabats (all flying foxes of the Old World) and microbats (all bats excluding flying foxes). However, more recent genetic studies have highlighted that some bat species previously considered to be microbats, e. g. rhinolophids, are more related to flying foxes than to true microbats (Teeling et aL, 2000). The most advanced phylogenies group bats into two clades: Yinpterochiroptera including for example flying foxes, rhinolophids, hippposiderids and some minor groups, and Yangochiroptera (all others) (Teeling et al., 2005).Some bats form colonies of more than 30 million individuals. These are the largest and most dense aggregations of all mammals. The complex social interactions of bats within these large colonies are virtually unknown. However, it is very likely that the risk of disease transmission is affected by colony size and the type of social system bats exhibit. The longevity of bats - some bat species live for more than 40 years (Wilkinson und South, 2002) - in conjunction with the manifold social interactions in bat colonies could add to the high probability of disease transmission among bats.Recent studies about the dietary preference of bats revealed fascinating facts. It was widely accepted that all bats of the temperate zone are insect-feeding. But recently a bat species of the Mediterranean area has been found to be a specialist hunter of migrating birds (Popa-Lisseanu et al., 2007). Until recently, carnivorous bats have only been described for tropical regions, where bats feed on a diversity of food items, such as fruits nectar, frogs, fishes, reptiles, insects, or mammals. Blood-feeding vampire bats are particularly interesting, since their feeding habit predisposes them as very efficient vectors of rabies.Changes in the way how humans exploit global resources in combination with climate changes have already influenced the pattern how bats utilize natural resources and also their geographical distribution (e. g. Voigt and Kelm, 2006). The exponential increase of human populations in developing countries has brought humans in close contact with bats and their diseased. A thorough study of bats as vectors for zoonotic pathogens could be helpful for installing important measures of prevention, but this requires a partial change in policies from a re-active to a more pro-active research approach.\"'], ['Inferring host-parasite relationships using stable isotopes: implications for disease transmission and host specificity,\"By: Stapp, Paul; Salkeld, Daniel J.\",ECOLOGY  Volume: 90   Issue: 11   Pages: 3268-3273   Published: NOV 2009,\"Identifying the roles of different hosts and vectors is a major challenge in the study of the ecology of diseases caused by multi-host pathogens. Intensive field studies suggested that grasshopper mice (Onychomys leucogaster) help spread the bacterium that causes plague (Yersinia pestis) in prairie dog colonies by sharing fleas with prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus); yet conclusive evidence that prairie dog fleas (Oropsylla hirsuta) feed on grasshopper mice is lacking. Using stable nitrogen isotope analysis, we determined that many blood-engorged O. hirsuta collected from wild grasshopper mice apparently contained blood meals of prairie dogs. These results suggest that grasshopper mice may be infected with Y. pestis via mechanisms other than. ea feeding, e. g., early phase or mechanical transmission or scavenging carcasses, and raise questions about the ability of grasshopper mice to maintain Y. pestis in prairie dog colonies during years between plague outbreaks. They also indicate that caution may be warranted when inferring feeding relationships based purely on the occurrence of fleas or other haematophagous ectoparasites on hosts. Stable-isotope analysis may complement or provide a useful alternative to immunological or molecular techniques for identifying hosts of cryptically feeding ectoparasites, and for clarifying feeding relationships in studies of host-parasite interactions.\"'], ['The ecology of the Trypanosoma cruzi transmission cycle: Dispersion of zymodeme 3 (Z3) in wild hosts from Brazilian biomes,\"By: Lisboa, Cristiane Varella; Chagas Xavier, Sarnanta Cristina das; Herrera, Heitor Miraglia; et al.\",VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY  Volume: 165   Issue: 1-2   Pages: 19-24   Published: OCT 28 2009,\"Two main genotypes in Trypanosoma cruzi subpopulations can be distinguished by PCR amplification of sequences from the mini-exon gene non-transcribed spacer, respectively, T. cruzi I (TCI) and T. cruzi II (TCII). This technique is also capable of distinguishing a third assemblage of subpopulations that do not fit in these genotypes and that remain known as zymodeme Z3 (D). The distribution pattern as well as the mammalian host range of this latter T. cruzi sublineage still remains unclear. Thus, the intention of our study was to increase the information regarding these aspects. The mini-exon analysis of T cruzi isolates obtained from sylvatic animals in the Amazon Forest, Atlantic Rainforest, Caatinga and Pantanal showed that prevalence of the Z3 subpopulation in nature was low (15 out of 225 isolates, corresponding to 7%). A higher prevalence of Z3 was observed in the Caatinga (15%) and the Pantanal (12%). Infection by Z3 was observed in mammalian hosts included in Carnivora. Chiroptera, Didelphimorphia, Rodentia and Xernathra. The T cruzi Z3 subpopulation was observed also in mixed infections (33%) with TCI (n = 2) and TO (n = 3). These results demonstrate that T cruzi Z3 displays a wider distribution and host range than formerly understood as it has been demonstrated to be able infect species included in five orders of mammalian host species dispersed through all forest strata of the four Brazilian biomes evaluated.

Jory; Collinge, Sharon K.; Bai, Ying; et al.\",VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES  Volume: 9   Issue: 5   Pages: 491-497   Published: OCT 2009,\"Sylvatic plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, is a flea-borne disease that primarily affects rodents but has been detected in over 200 mammal species worldwide. Mammalian carnivores are routinely surveyed as sentinels of local plague activity, since they can present antibodies to Y. pestis infection but show few clinical signs. In Boulder County, Colorado, USA, plague epizootic events are episodic and occur in black-tailed prairie dogs. Enzootic hosts are unidentified as are plague foci. For three years, we systematically sampled carnivores in two distinct habitat types to determine whether carnivores may play a role in maintenance or transmission of Y. pestis and to identify habitats associated with increased plague prevalence. We sampled 83 individuals representing six carnivore species and found only two that had been exposed to Y. pestis. The low overall rate of plague exposure in carnivores suggests that plague may be ephemeral in this study system, and thus we cannot draw any conclusions regarding habitat-associated plague foci or temporal changes in plague activity. Plague epizootics involving prairie dogs were confirmed in this study system during two of the three years of this study, and we therefore suggest that the targeting carnivores to survey for plague may not be appropriate in all ecological systems.\"'], ['Large-scale spatio-temporal shifts in the diet of a predator mediated by an emerging infectious disease of its main prey,\"By: Moleon, Marcos; Antonio Sanchez-Zapata, Jose; Real, Joan; et al.\",JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY  Volume: 36   Issue: 8   Pages: 1502-1515   Published: AUG 2009,\"AimTo explore the influence of an emerging infectious disease (EID) affecting a prey species on the spatial patterns and temporal shifts in the diet of a predator over a large geographical scale. We reviewed studies on the diet of Bonelli\\'s eagles (Hieraaetus fasciatus) in order to determine the repercussions of the reduction in the density of its main prey, the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), caused by outbreaks of rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) since 1988.LocationWestern continental Europe.MethodsWe compiled published and unpublished information on the diet of breeding Bonelli\\'s eagles from Portugal, Spain and France for a 39-year study period (1968-2006). Nonparametric tests were used in order to analyse temporal shifts in diet composition and trophic diversity (H\\') between the periods of \\'high\\' (before outbreak of RHD) and \\'low\\' rabbit density (after outbreak of RHD). A combination of hierarchical agglomerative clustering and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analyses were used to test for the existence of geographical patterns in the diet of Bonelli\\'s eagles in each period.ResultsThe diet of the Bonelli\\'s eagle consisted of rabbit (28.5%), pigeons (24.0%), partridges (15.3%), \\'other birds\\' (11.6%), \\'other mammals\\' (7.1%), corvids (7.0%), and herptiles (6.4%). However, RHD had large consequences for its feeding ecology: the consumption of rabbits decreased by one-third after the outbreak of RHD. Conversely, trophic diversity (H\\') increased after outbreak of RHD. At the same time, the analyses showed clear geographical patterns in the diet of the Bonelli\\'s eagle before, but not after, RHD outbreak.Main conclusionsGeographical patterns in the diet of the Bonelli\\'s eagle in western Europe seem to be driven mainly by spatio-temporal variation in the abundance of rabbits and, to a lesser extent, by the local (territorial) environmental features conditioning the presence and density of alternative prey species. We show that an EID can disrupt predator-prey relationships at large spatial and temporal scales through a severe decline in the population of the main prey species. Hence we argue that strict guidelines should be drawn up to prevent human-aided dissemination of \\'pathogen pollution\\', which can threaten wildlife not only at the population and species level but also at the community and ecosystem scale.\"'], ['Morphology and Occurrence of Species of Toxocara in Wild Mammal Populations from Egypt,\"By: Radwan, Nahla A.; Khalil, Amal I.; El Mahi, Rasha A.\",COMPARATIVE PARASITOLOGY  Volume: 76   Issue: 2   Pages: 273-282   Published: JUL 2009,\"Toxocara spp. are zoonotic helminths of domestic and wild mammals and have been implicated ill Serious human disease.

Several duck species are naturally resistant to HP Asian H5N1 influenza viruses. These duck species can shed and spread virus from both the respiratory and intestinal tracts while showing few or no disease signs. While the HP Asian H5N1 viruses are 100% lethal for chickens and other gallinaceous poultry, the absence of disease signs in some duck species has led to the concept that ducks are the \"\"Trojan horses\"\" of H5N1 in their surreptitious spread of virus.

We attribute this to the enforcement of Vietnam\\'s Law 169/2005/QD UBND, introduced in 2005, which prohibits the movement and sale of wild and ornamental birds in cities. Nevertheless, 91.3% (21/23) of bird vendors perceived no risk of H5N1 infection from their birds, and the trade continues, albeit at reduced levels, in open market shops. These findings highlight the importance of continued law enforcement to maintain this trade reduction and the associated benefits to human and animal health and biodiversity conservation.\"'], ['A reassessment of the epidemiology of Rice yellow mottle virus following recent advances in field and molecular studies,\"By: Traore, O.; Pinel-Galzi, A.; Sorho, F.; et al.\",VIRUS RESEARCH  Volume: 141   Issue: 2   Pages: 258-267   Published: MAY 2009,\"The available knowledge on the epidemiology of Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) is reassessed in the light of major advances in field and molecular studies of the disease it causes in rice. Previously undescribed means of transmission by mammals and through leaf contact have been discovered recently. Several agricultural practices, including the use of seedbed nurseries, have also contributed to a massive build-up of RYMV inoculum. Phytosanitation is now known to be critical to reduce disease incidence in rice. A new model of the ecology of RYMV in which man plays a central role has emerged. Furthermore, estimates of the evolutionary rate of change of RYMV provided a time-frame for its epidemiology, the first attempt for a plant virus. Earlier interpretations of the patterns of virus diversity which assumed a long-term evolution, and assigned a major role to adaptive events had to be discarded. In contrast, a wave-like model of dispersal of RYMV, which postulates its initial diversification in East Africa, followed by westward spread across the continent, was developed, refined and dated. The most salient - and largely unexpected - finding is that RYMV emerged recently and subsequently spread rapidly throughout Africa in the last two centuries, Diversification and Spread of RYMV has been concomitant with an extension of rice cultivation in Africa since the 19th century. This major agro-ecological change increased the encounters between primary hosts of RYMV and Cultivated rice. It also modified the landscape ecology in ways that facilitated virus spread.

Travassos; et al.\",EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES  Volume: 15   Issue: 4   Pages: 519-525   Published: APR 2009,\"In 1993, an outbreak of encephalitis among 125 affected equids in coastal Chiapas, Mexico, resulted in a 50% case-fatality rate. The outbreak was attributed to Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) subtype IE, not previously associated with equine disease and death. To better understand the ecology of this VEEV strain in Chiapas, we experimentally infected 5 species of wild rodents and evaluated their competence as reservoir and amplifying hosts. Rodents from 1 species (Baiomys musculus) showed signs of disease and died by day 8 postinoculation. Rodents from the 4 other species (Liomys salvini, Oligoryzomys fulvescens, Oryzomys couesi, and Sigmodon hispidus) became viremic but survived and developed neutralizing antibodies, indicating that multiple species may contribute to VEEV maintenance. By infecting numerous rodent species and producing adequate viremia, VEEV may increase its chances of long-term persistence in nature and could increase risk for establishment in disease-endemic areas and amplification outside the disease-endemic range.\"'], ['Demography and Life Histories of Sympatric Patas Monkeys, Erythrocebus patas, and Vervets, Cercopithecus aethiops, in Laikipia, Kenya,\"By: Isbell, Lynne A.; Young, Truman P.; Jaffe, Karin Enstam; et al.\",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY  Volume: 30   Issue: 1   Pages: 103-124   Published: FEB 2009,\"Mortality patterns are thought to be strong selective forces on life history traits, with high adult mortality and low immature mortality favoring early and rapid reproduction. Patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas) have the highest potential rates of population increase for their body size of any haplorhine primate because they reproduce both earlier and more often. We report here 10 yr of comparative demographic data on a population of patas monkeys and a sympatric population of vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops), a closely related species differing in aspects of social system, ecology, and life history. The data reveal that 1) adult female patas monkeys have significantly higher mortality than adult female vervets; 2) infant mortality in patas monkeys is relatively low compared to the norm for mammals because it is not significantly different from that of adult female patas monkeys; and 3) infant mortality is significantly higher than adult female mortality in vervets. For both species, much of the mortality could be attributed to predation. An epidemic illness was also a major contributor to the mortality of adult female patas monkeys whereas chronic exposure to pathogens in a cold and damp microenvironment may have contributed to the mortality of infant vervets. Both populations experienced large fluctuations during the study period. Our results support the prediction from demographic models of life history evolution that high adult mortality relative to immature mortality selects for early maturation.\"'], ['PREVALENCE OF ANTIBODIES AGAINST TOXOPLASMA GONDII IN POLAR BEARS (URSUS MARITIMUS) FROM SVALBARD AND EAST GREENLAND,\"By: Oksanen, A.; Asbakk, K.; Prestrud, K.

Antibody prevalences were 3.6% among cubs dependent on their mothers and 21.4% among subadults and adults. Among subadults and adults there was tin interaction between population and sex, with similar prevalences among females (Svalbard = 19.5%, Greenland = 18.0%), but a high frequency among Svalbard males (28.7%) as compared to Greenland males (5.8%). The pattern was also significant after correcting for differences in age distribution. The sex-population interaction term is believed to be connected to area- and sex-specific feeding ecology.

Rhiannon; et al.\",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES  Volume: 364   Issue: 1513   Pages: 61-69   Published: JAN 12 2009,\"Sexual dimorphism in immune function is a common pattern in vertebrates and also in a number of invertebrates. Most often, females are more \\'immunocompetent\\' than males. The underlying causes are explained by either the role of immunosuppressive substances, such as testosterone, or by fundamental differences in male and female life histories. Here, we investigate some of the main predictions of the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis (ICHH) in a comparative framework using mammals. We focus specifically on the prediction that measures of sexual competition across species explain the observed patterns of variation in sex-specific immunocompetence within species. Our results are not consistent with the ICHH, but we do find that female mammals tend to have higher white blood cell counts (WBC), with some further associations between cell counts and longevity in females. We also document positive covariance between sexual dimorphism in immunity, as measured by a subset of WBC, and dimorphism in the duration of effective breeding. This is consistent with the application of \\'Bateman\\'s principle\\' to immunity, with females maximizing fitness by lengthening lifespan through greater investment in immune defences. Moreover, we present a meta-analysis of insect immunity, as the lack of testosterone in insects provides a means to investigate Bateman\\'s principle for immunity independently of the ICHH. Here, we also find a systematic female bias in the expression of one of the two components of insect immune function that we investigated ( phenoloxidase). From these analyses, we conclude that the mechanistic explanations of the ICHH lack empirical support. Instead, fitness-related differences between the sexes are potentially sufficient to explain many natural patterns in immunocompetence.\"'], ['Mammalia fauna associated to foci of neotropical leishmaniasis. Situation in Venezuela.,\"By: Reyes, Adriana; Arrivillaga, Jazzmin\",BOLETIN DE MALARIOLOGIA Y SALUD AMBIENTAL  Volume: 49   Issue: 1   Pages: 35-52   Published: JAN-JUL 2009,\"The potential host-reservoir fauna for Leishmania in Venezuela is not well known. The infected mammals checklist for the neotropical region, can be useful as base of design of distribution maps for potential hosts in Venezuela. Rodents are the most important hosts for Leishmania in the neotropics, which is a biological evidence for the use of murine models for in vivo studies in leishmaniasis. The animal surveys in leishmaniasis studies have shown that the families Echimyidae, Cricetidae and Muridae are the most representative hosts. In Venezuela, species belonging to Oryzomys, Heteromys, Proechimys and Rattus genera have been reported as infected by Leishmania. However, species of Xenarthra, Didelphydae and wild carnivores have not been reported infected, and these are potentially epidemiological important, based on their susceptible host capacity, their ecology and the congruent geographical distribution with leishmaniasis foci. The association of these mammals as potential hosts-reservoirs with the occurrence of Leishmania and also with the infected vectors must be explained based on the population dynamics and ecology of these links and the disease. Nevertheless, the parasitological studies on reservoirs are supported in the search of natural infection only, without finding their role in the transmission cycle. Population ecology studies in mammals must be mandatory in leishmaniasis areas, in order to understand the epidemiological dynamic and especially to design more effectives multidisciplinary strategies for the disease management.\"'], ['ON THE INTERFERENCE OF CLINICAL OUTCOME ON RABIES TRANSMISSION AND PERPETUATION,\"By: Brandao, P. E.\",JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES  Volume: 15   Issue: 2   Pages: 190-203   Published: 2009,\"Rabies is a viral zoonotic infectious disease that affects mammals and is caused by genotypes/species of the Lyssavirus genus (Rhabdoviridae, Mononegavirales), with the genotype 1 (classic rabies virus - RABV) being the most prevalent. Despite continuous efforts, rabies is still an incurable disease that causes thousands of deaths amongst humans worldwide. Due to a wide range of hosts and the different evolutionary paths of RABV in each host, several host-specific variants have arisen in an ongoing process. The result of RABV replication in nervous tissues may lead to two opposite clinical outcomes, i.e., paralytic/dumb form and encephalitic/furious one. The paralytic form creates dead-end hosts mainly amongst herbivores, while the furious form of the disease allows for augmented transmission when manifested in gregarious carnivores, as their natural aggressive behavior is accentuated by the disease itself. The aim of this article is to propose a theoretical model intended to explore how the rabies virus intrinsically modulates the immune system of different host classes, the pathological changes that the virus causes in these animals and how these elements favor its own perpetuation in nature, thus providing a basis for better prediction of the patterns this disease may present.\"'], ['Biology, ecology and pathogenicity of rods of the Bartonella genus,\"By: Guz, Katarzyna; Doroszkiewicz, Wlodzimierz\",POSTEPY MIKROBIOLOGII  Volume: 48   Issue: 1   Pages: 43-54   Published: 2009,\"The investigation of Bartonella rods began in the second half of the XX century. During the last 15 years several new species of bacteria belonging to the genus Bartonella have been discovered and all the infections caused by these microorganisms have been rated as,emerging and re-emerging diseases\"\". At present, over 20 species of the genus Bartonella are known. Recently, fourteen of them have been associated with an increasing spectrum of clinical syndromes in humans including bacillary angiomatosis, peliosis hepatis, bacteremia, endocarditis, myocarditis, neuritidis, chronic lymphadenopathy, and cat scratch disease. Bartonellosis is widespread while the Carrion\\'s disease appears only in endemic regions of South America. Some of Bartonella species can also cause veterinary problems. They are responsible for illnesses of domestic animals. Mammals, particularly rodents, are the natural reservoirs of Bartonella spp. They often cause an intraerythrocytic asymptomatic bacteremia in the host. Bartonellos is are vector-borne diseases that are transmitted by blood-sucking arthropods such as: fleas, lice or ticks. A recent research has proved that these bacteria can be transmitted directly as a zoonosis by cats\\'. or rats\\' scratches or bites. Bartonella sp. are fastidious, aerobic, pleomorphic gramnegative rods, which grow slowly in the enriched culture medium. Diagnosis of Bartonella sp. infections is a rapidly expanding field. Useful methods in the identification of Bartonella species comprise the techniques employed in microbiology, histology, genetics and serology. The most universal method to identify Bartonella infection is still serology testing. At present, the investigations of Bartonellaceae family are carried out in many research centres. It is evident that the growing knowledge about the biology and ecology of these microorganisms is reflected in the constant improvement of the methods of diagnosis, treatment and prevention.\"'], ['Public Health and Epidemiological Considerations For Avian Influenza Risk Mapping and Risk Assessment,\"By: Dudley, Joseph P.\",ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY  Volume: 13   Issue: 2     Article Number: 21   Published: DEC 2008,\"Avian influenza viruses are now widely recognized as important threats to agricultural biosecurity and public health, and as the potential source for pandemic human influenza viruses. Human infections with avian influenza viruses have been reported from Asia (H5N1, H5N2, H9N2), Africa (H5N1, H10N7), Europe (H7N7, H7N3, H7N2), and North America (H7N3, H7N2, H11N9). Direct and indirect public health risks from avian influenzas are not restricted to the highly pathogenic H5N1 \"\"bird flu\"\" virus, and include low pathogenic as well as high pathogenic strains of other avian influenza virus subtypes, e. g., H1N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7, and H9N2. Research has shown that the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic was caused by an H1N1 influenza virus of avian origins, and during the past decade, fatal human disease and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed among persons infected with H5N1 and H7N7 avian influenza viruses. Our ability to accurately assess and map the potential economic and public health risks associated with avian influenza outbreaks is currently constrained by uncertainties regarding key aspects of the ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza viruses in birds and humans, and the mechanisms by which highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are transmitted between and among wild birds, domestic poultry, mammals, and humans. Key factors needing further investigation from a risk management perspective include identification of the driving forces behind the emergence and persistence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses within poultry populations, and a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms regulating transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses between industrial poultry farms and backyard poultry flocks. More information is needed regarding the extent to which migratory bird populations to contribute to the transnational and transcontinental spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, and the potential for wild bird populations to serve as reservoirs for highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. There are still uncertainties regarding the epidemiological and ecological mechanisms that regulate \"\"spill-over\"\" and \"\"spill-back\"\" transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses between poultry and wild bird populations, and the interspecies transmission of avian influenza from infected birds to humans and other species of mammals. Further investigations are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of poultry vaccination programs for the control and eradication of avian influenza in poultry populations at the national and regional level, and the effect of long term poultry vaccination programs on human public health risks from avian influenza viruses. There is a need to determine risk factors associated with the extent of direct human involvement in the spread and proliferation of avian influenza viruses through commercial supply chain and transportation networks, and specific risk factors associated with domestic and international trade in live poultry, captive wild birds, poultry food products, (meat, eggs), poultry by-products ( feathers, poultry meal), poultry manure, and poultry litter. Addressing these issues will greatly enhance our ability to implement economically and ecologically sustainable programs for the control of avian influenza outbreaks in wild and domesticated birds, increase our capability for promoting the protection of wild bird populations from disease and disruption, and help improve food security and public health in countries worldwide.\"'], ['Influenza Infection in Wild Raccoons,\"By: Hall, Jeffrey S.; Bentler, Kevin T.; Landolt, Gabrielle; et al.\",EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES  Volume: 14   Issue: 12   Pages: 1842-1848   Published: DEC 2008,\"Raccoons (Procyon lotor) are common, widely distributed animals that frequently come into contact with wild waterfowl, agricultural operations, and humans.

We found antibodies to a variety of influenza virus subtypes (H10N7, H4N6, H4N2, H3, and H1) with wide geographic variation in seroprevalence. Experimental infection studies showed that raccoons become infected with avian and human influenza A viruses, shed and transmit virus to virus-free animals, and seroconvert. Analyses of cellular receptors showed that raccoons have avian and human type receptors with a similar distribution as found in human respiratory tracts. The potential exists for co-infection of multiple subtypes of influenza virus with genetic reassortment and creation of novel strains of influenza virus. Experimental and field data indicate that raccoons may play an important role in influenza disease ecology and pose risks to agriculture and human health.\"'], ['Effects of the removal of large herbivores on fleas of small mammals,\"By: McCauley, Douglas J.; Keesing, Felicia; Young, Truman; et al.\",JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY  Volume: 33   Issue: 2   Pages: 263-268   Published: DEC 2008,\"The removal of large herbivorous mammals can cause dramatic increases in the densities of small mammals. These small mammals are hosts for a variety of ectoparasites, many of which are important pathogens of human diseases such as plague and murine typhus. It is thus valuable from a human health perspective to understand if large herbivore removals can indirectly affect ectoparasite numbers and thus potentially alter disease risk. To make this determination, we experimentally excluded large herbivores and measured the number of fleas present on the numerically dominant small mammal, the pouched mouse, Saccostomus mearnsi. Removing large herbivores nearly doubled S. mearnsi density, while the percentage of mice infested with fleas (prevalence) and the average number of fleas per sampled mouse (intensity) remained constant. The net effect of doubling the number of mice via the removal of large herbivores was a near doubling in the number of fleas present in the study habitat. Because these fleas also parasitize humans and can serve as disease vectors, this work empirically demonstrates a potential mechanism by which ecosystem alterations could affect human risk for zoonotic diseases.

Gray squirrels, Sciurus carolinensis, also feed on the corn bait in the feeding troughs of 4-posters, but in doing so, leave abundant corn fragments and meal that impede the flow of uneaten corn into the troughs. Large accumulations of fragments and meal adversely affect the operation of 4-posters and their use by deer. A battery-operated closure mechanism controlled by a photo sensor was developed to block the flow of corn into the troughs during the day when squirrels are active and deer infrequently visit 4-posters. The effectiveness of the diurnal corn restriction (DCR) concept and restriction mechanism was tested in a field trial at a tick-infested site in Maryland. DCR effectively eliminated accumulation of whole corn, partially eaten corn and corn meal in corn troughs associated with squirrel feeding. At the same time, deer usage of 4-posters was not diminished.

In total, 798 were not blood-fed and 223 bloodmeals could be gathered on filter paper. The identification of the origin of these meals was made by amplification of mitochondrial Cytb gene, then heteroduplex technique by using the Gambian rat (Cricetomys gambianus) as driver. Samples of fauna, collected on the local market, consisted of 24 mammal and two reptile blood and muscle samples, to which it is necessary to add human samples (27 potential hosts). 19 meals could not be amplified for technical reasons, 65 were amplified, but the acquired patterns corresponded to none of the tested potential hosts. On the 139 identified meals, 55 % were taken on the block-fronted duiker (Cephalophus nigrifrons) and 19 % on pig. Stomoxys transvittatus, the most abundant species in Makokou, is very opportunistic: 68 % of meals were taken on six different hosts, among whom 48 % on the block-fronted duiker and 32 % were not identified using the panel of tested hosts. S. xanthomelas took 50 % of its meals on the moustached monkey (Cercopithecus cephus) and 7 % on human beings. S. calcitrans, species of anthropised areas, took 33 % of its meals on human beings. These three species can therefore take bloodmeals on wild fauna and human beings. They could potentially play an important role in the emergence of zoonotic diseases. The four other species took their bloodmeals only on wild fauna and pig, the only example of domestic fauna in this study. This preliminary study must be followed up using a larger number of specimens and by increasing the diversity of the tested potential hosts.\"'], ['Prairie dog presence affects occurrence patterns of disease vectors on small mammals,\"By: Brinkerhoff, R.

The black-tailed prairie dog is a species of conservation concern that is highly susceptible to plague, a flea-transmitted disease. Prairie dogs (Cynomys) alter the grassland communities in which they exist and have been shown to affect populations of small rodents, which are purported disease reservoirs. To explore potential ecological effects of black-tailed prairie dogs on plague dynamics, we quantified flea occurrence patterns on small mammals in the presence and absence of prairie dogs at 8 study areas across their geographic range. Small mammals sampled from prairie dog colonies showed significantly higher flea prevalence, flea abundance, and relative flea species richness than those sampled from off-colony sites. Successful plague transmission likely is dependent on high prevalence and abundance of fleas that can serve as competent vectors. Prairie dogs may therefore facilitate the maintenance of plague by increasing flea occurrence on potential plague reservoir species. Our data demonstrate the previously unreported ecological influence of prairie dogs on vector species assemblages, which could influence disease dynamics.\"'], ['MODELING EVOLUTION AND PERSISTENCE OF NEUROLOGICAL VIRAL DISEASES IN WILD POPULATIONS,\"By: Dimitrov, Dobromir T.; King, Aaron A.\",MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES AND ENGINEERING  Volume: 5   Issue: 4   Pages: 729-741   Published: OCT 2008,\"Viral infections are one of the leading source of mortality world-wide.

We present a novel, multilevel theoretical approach that integrates information on bat biology collected at a lower level of organization, the individual with its physiological characteristics, into a modeling framework at a higher level, the population. Our individual component describes the growth of an individual female bat by modeling the dynamics of the main body compartments (lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates). A structured population model based on extended McKendrick-von Foerster partial differential equations integrates those individual dynamics and provides insight into possible regulatory mechanisms of population size as well as conditions of population survival and extinction. Though parameterized for a specific bat species, all modeling components can be modified to investigate other bats with similar life histories.

Spatial epidemiology is the study of the spatial variation in disease risk or incidence and explicitly addresses spatial structures and functions that factor into disease. The GIS consists of input, management, analysis, and presentation of spatial disease data and can act as an integrative tool so that a range of varied data sources can be combined to describe different environmental aspects of wild animals and their diseases. The use of modern spatial analyses and GIS is becoming well developed in the field of marine mammal ecology and biology, but has just recently started to gain more use in disease research. The use of GIS methodology and spatial analysis in nondisease marine mammal studies is briefly discussed, while examples of the specific uses of these tools in mapping, surveillance and monitoring, disease cluster detection, identification of environmental predictors of disease in wildlife populations, risk assessment, and modeling of diseases, is presented. Marine mammal disease investigations present challenges, such as less consistent access to animals for sampling, fewer baseline data on diseases in wild populations, and less robust epidemiologic study designs, but several recommendations for future research are suggested. Since location is an integral part of investigating disease, spatial epidemiology and GIS should be incorporated as a data management and analysis tool in the study of marine mammal diseases and conservation medicine.\"'], ['Phylogeny and geography predict pathogen community similarity in wild primates and humans,\"By: Davies, T. Jonathan; Pedersen, Amy B.\",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES  Volume: 275   Issue: 1643   Pages: 1695-1701   Published: JUL 22 2008,\"In natural systems, host species are often co-infected by multiple pathogen species, and recent work has suggested that many pathogens can infect a wide range of host species. An important question therefore is what determines the host range of a pathogen and the community of pathogens found within a given host species. Using primates as a model, we show that infectious diseases are more often shared between species that are closely related and inhabit the same geographical region. We find that host relatedness is the best overall predictor of whether two host species share the same pathogens. A higher frequency of pathogen host shifts between close relatives or inheritance of pathogens from a common ancestor may explain this result. For viruses, geographical overlap among neighbouring primate hosts is more important in determining host range. We suggest this is because rapid evolution within viral lineages allows host jumps across larger evolutionary distances. We also show that the phylogenetic pattern of pathogen sharing with humans is the same as that between wild primates. For humans, this means we share a higher proportion of pathogens with the great apes, including chimpanzees and gorillas, because these species are our closest relatives.\"'], ['Extinction of the autochthonous small mammals of Mallorca (Gymnesic Islands, Western Mediterranean) and its ecological consequences,\"By: Bover, Pere; Alcover, Josep Antoni\",JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY  Volume: 35   Issue: 6   Pages: 1112-1122   Published: JUN 2008,\"Aim To investigate the chronology, causes and consequences of the extinction of the autochthonous Pleistocene small mammals of Mallorca.Location Mallorca (Gymnesic Islands, Balearics, Western Mediterranean).Methods We have obtained the first direct (14)C ages from the bone collagen of selected samples of two extinct endemic small mammals from Mallorca: the Balearic dormouse, Eliomys morpheus (Rodentia: Myoxidae) and the Balearic shrew, Asoriculus hidalgoi (Soricomorpha: Soricidae). We also present evidence for the absence of both endemics from the earliest Mallorcan archaeological sites and for the introduction of the garden dormouse, Eliomys quercinus, and the wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus. Combined information from direct dating of bone collagen of E. quercinus and A. sylvaticus and from cultural associations provides an adequate framework to establish the chronology of the faunal change and to compare it with the chronological information available on climatic change and the first arrival of humans on the islands.Results The chronological record includes the latest evidence available for the survival of endemic species and the earliest introduction of small mammals into Mallorca. We present \\'uncertainty periods for extinction\\' (UPEs) of both endemic mammals based on the chronology of their last occurrence and on the inferred timing of their extinction (restricted UPEs).Main conclusions Possible causes for the extinction of autochthonous small mammals on Mallorca are discussed. Once we have discarded climatic causes, predation by invasive species, competition with newcomers and habitat deterioration, the introduction of diseases emerges as the most reasonable explanation for these extinctions. Based on the identification of changes in keystone species in Mallorcan ecosystems, we propose a tentative schedule of key ecological changes that have taken place over the past 5 millennia.\"'], ['A novel approach for assessing density and range-wide abundance of prairie dogs,\"By: Facka, Aaron N.; Ford, Paulette L.; Roemer, Gary W.\",JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY  Volume: 89   Issue: 2   Pages: 356-364   Published: APR 2008,\"Habitat loss, introduced disease, and government-sponsored eradication programs have caused population declines in all 5 species of prairie dogs. Black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) currently occupy only about 2% of an extensive geographic range (160 million hectares) and were recently considered for listing under the United States Endangered Species Act. Accurate estimates of density for populations of prairie dogs would be valuable for estimating range-wide abundance and for determining threats to species persistence, yet estimates of density using robust approaches (e.g., complete enumeration or mark-recapture) are rarely undertaken. We introduce a novel approach to estimating density of prairie dogs using mark-resight methods. Using mark-resight, mark-recapture, and 3 other indices, we estimated the abundance of prairie dogs on 3 reintroduced colonies over a 3-year period (2003-2005). We show that mark-resight is a superior approach to estimating abundance of prairie dogs, that average density estimates from the southern extremity of the species\\' range are considerably lower (11.3 prairie dogs/ha) than estimates from more northerly climes ((X) over bar = 18.3-90.3 prairie dogs/ha), and that population densities can fluctuate widely in accordance with local environmental conditions. We propose that resource agencies use mark-resight methods to obtain density estimates of prairie dog populations within diverse ecoregions, and couple these estimates with an assessment of the area occupied by prairie dog colonies to determine range-wide abundance.\"'], ['First detection of mycobacteria in African rodents and insectivores, using stratified pool screening,\"By: Durnez, Lies; Eddyani, Miriam; Mgode, Georgies F.; et al.\",APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY  Volume: 74   Issue: 3   Pages: 768-773   Published: FEB 2008,\"With the rising number of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS in developing countries, the control of mycobacteria is of growing importance. Previous studies have shown that rodents and insectivores are carriers of mycobacteria. However, it is not clear how widespread mycobacteria are in these animals and what their role is in spreading them. Therefore, the prevalence of mycobacteria in rodents and insectivores was studied in and around Morogoro, Tanzania. Live rodents were trapped, with three types of live traps, in three habitats. Pieces of organs were pooled per habitat, species, and organ type (stratified pooling); these sample pools were examined for the presence of mycobacteria by PCR, microscopy, and culture methods. The mycobacterial isolates were identified using phenotypic techniques and sequencing. In total, 708 small mammals were collected, 31 of which were shrews. By pool prevalence estimation, 2.65% of the animals were carriers of mycobacteria, with a higher prevalence in the urban areas and in Cricetomys gambianus and the insectivore Crocidura hirta. Nontuberculous mycobacteria (Mycobacterium chimaera, M. intracellulare, M. arupense, M. parascrofulaceum, and Mycobacterium spp.) were isolated from C gambianus, Mastomys natalensis, and C hirta. This study is the first to report findings of mycobacteria in African rodents and insectivores and the first in mycobacterial ecology to estimate the prevalence of mycobacteria after stratified pool screening. The fact that small mammals in urban areas carry more mycobacteria than those in the fields and that potentially pathogenic mycobacteria were isolated identifies a risk for other animals and humans, especially HIV/AIDS patients, that have a weakened immune system.\"'], ['The Effect of Habitat Fragmentation and Species Diversity Loss on Hantavirus Prevalence in Panama,\"By: Suzan, Gerardo; Marce, Erika; Giermakowski, J. Tomasz; et al.\",\"Edited by: Sparagano, OAE; Maillard, JC; Figueroa, JV\",\"Habitat fragmentation and diversity loss due to increased conversion of natural habitats to agricultural uses influence the distribution and abundance of wildlife species and thus may change the ecology of pathogen transmission. We used hantaviruses in Panama as a research model to determine whether anthropogenic environmental change is associated with changes in the dynamics of viral transmission. Specifically, we wanted to determine whether hantavirus infection was correlated with spatial attributes of the landscape at both large and small scales or whether these changes are mediated by changes in community composition. When analyzed at coarse spatial scales, hantavirus reservoirs were more commonly found in disturbed habitats and edge habitats than in forested areas. At local scales, reservoir species dominance was significantly correlated with the slope of the terrain. To evaluate the effect of small-mammal diversity loss on infection dynamics, we implemented an experiment with selective species removal at experimental sites. Seroprevalence of hantavirus was higher in the community of small mammals and increased through time in the experimental sites. The higher seroprevalence in experimental plots suggests that greater diversity likely reduces encounter rates between infected and susceptible hosts. Our studies suggest that habitat loss and fragmentation and species diversity loss are altering hantavirus infection dynamics in Panama. Our work represents a multidisciplinary approach toward disease research that includes biodiversity concerns such as environmental change and degradation, human settlement patterns, and the ecology of host and nonhost species, work that may be especially important in tropical countries.\"'], ['Unpacking beta: Within-Host Dynamics and the Evolutionary Ecology of Pathogen Transmission,\"By: Antolin, Michael F.\",ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS  Book Series: Annual Review of Ecology Evolution and Systematics   Volume: 39   Pages: 415-437   Published: 2008,\"Rather than being fixed, pathogen transmission varies and is thus an object of natural selection. I examine how opportunities for selection oil pathogen transmission depend on (a) pathogen fitness, (b) genetic variability, and (c) forces acting at within- and between-host levels. The transmission rate, beta, influences processes such as epidemic spread, postepidemic fade-outs,and low-level persistence. Complexity of infection processes within hosts leads to different transmission rates among hosts and between types of pathogens (viruses, bacteria, eukaryotic Protozoa). Generality emerges, however, by \"\"unpacking\"\" beta into within- and between-host opportunities for selection. This is illustrated by evolutionary biology of the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which causes plague in mammals, remains highly virulent and is transmitted by multiple routes, including fleas and direct contacts with infected hosts. The strength of with in-host selection is manifested through infectivity, replication, pathogenicity, and dissemination from hosts. At the between-host level, responses to selection are less predictable because of environmental variation, whereas vector-borne transmission (usually by arthropods) provides additional opportunities for selection and trade-offs between vectors and hosts. In subdivided host populations, selection favors transmission before local pathogen extinction occurs, but key components (e.g. infectious periods of hosts) are determined by within-host dynamics. Pathogen transmission is often viewed in the context of transmission-virulence trade-offs, but within-host dynamics may cause host damage unrelated to transmission, and thus transmission-virulence trade-offs are not universal.\"'], ['Roadside ecology and epidemiology of tick-borne diseases,\"By: Haemig, Paul D.; Waldenstrom, Jonas; Olsen, Bjorn\",SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES  Volume: 40   Issue: 11-12   Pages: 853-858   Article Number: PII 794904621   Published: 2008,\"When humans, pets and livestock walk along roads, they may encounter questing ticks and tick-borne pathogens. A new field of environmental science called road ecology can help researchers study the complex epidemiology of tick-borne diseases in the unique roadside environment. This paper reviews some of the important ways that roads alter the distribution, abundance and behaviour of wildlife species that are involved in the enzootic cycles of tick-borne diseases. Compared to the surrounding landscape, roadways often constitute a different environment and hence there is no assurance that disease risk along roads will be the same as in the adjacent landscape, or that disease control measures taken in the surrounding landscape will work in the adjacent roadway. Since roadways have their own special ecological conditions, are used extensively by the human populace and play strategic roles in community security, we believe that roadways should be one of the habitats where tick-borne diseases are studied. It is amazing that at this late period of human history, epidemiological research along such important corridors has been almost completely ignored.\"'], ['Spatial distribution model of a Hantavirus reservoir, the long-tailed colilargo,\"By: Carbajo, Anibal E.; Pardinas, Ulyses F.

This distribution can be modeled as a function of environmental variables. We georeferenced an extensive database of records of the hantavirus reservoir Oligoryzomys longicaudatus (Cricetidae: Sigmodontinae) in Argentina and used generalized linear models to model the probability of the presence of this reservoir as a function of environmental variables. The variables used in the multiple logistic regression were temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, altitude, tree cover, grass cover, bare soil cover, and distance to rivers, to water bodies, and to roads; 2 phytogeographic classifications also were included. Spatial autocorrelation was considered in the model by including a spatial dependence covariate. The best model included temperature and precipitation as explanatory variables. External validation showed that the model without the space covariate correctly classified 95% of the sites with the rodent and 70% of the sites without it; the model including the spatial term correctly classified 100% of the sites with the rodent and 70% of the sites without it. A secondary model included days with frost and percent cover by bare soil as explanatory variables. O. longicaudatus was recorded in 97% of sites in the High Andean-Subantarctic regions, 65% of sites in the Monte-Espinal-Patagonian regions, and 0% of sites in the Pampean region.\"'], ['Effects of habitat fragmentation on wild mammal infection by Trypanosoma cruzi,\"By: Vaz, V.

The transformation of a continuous forest into a fragmented area results ina hyper-dynamic landscape with unpredictable consequences to overall ecosystem health. The effct of the fragmentation process on Trypanosoma cruzi infection amonmg small wild mammals was studied in an Atlantic Rain Forest lanscspe. Comapring continuous forest to fragmented habitat, marsupials were less abundant than rodents in the continuous lanscape. An overall decrease in small wild mamal richness was observed in the smaller fragments. An anti T-cruzi seroprevalence of 18%(82/440) was detected by immonuflourescense assay. Moreover, this seroprevalence was higher in the fragmented habitat in the continuous forest. According to the collected data, 3 main factors seem to modulate infection by T. cruzi in small wild mammals; (i) habitat fragmentation; (ii) biodiversity loss; (iii) increase of marsupial abudance in mammal communities. Furthermore, an extremely mild controlled infection by T. cruzi was detected since no patent parasitaemia could be detected in fresh blood samples, and no parasites were isolated by haemoculture.\"'], ['Molecular characterization of major histocompatibility complex class II DQB and DRB genes in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus and T-aduncus) from the western Pacific,\"By: Yang, Wei-Cheng; Chou, Lien-Siang; Hu, Jer-Ming\",ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES  Volume: 46   Issue: 6   Pages: 664-679   Published: NOV 2007,\"Variability of the major histocompatibility complex is very suitable for investigating a wide range of open questions in evolutionary ecology and conservation because it reflects evolutionarily relevant and adaptive processes within and between populations. Herein, we present the first full-length expressed DQB and DRB gene products in the order Cetacea from 2 species of bottlenose dolphins (genus Tursiops, family Delphinidae) of the western Pacific that differ in their diet, microflora, and habitat. These species might represent a natural model through which we can examine the immunogenetic consequences of different pathogenic and environmental influences on the MHC of mammals. Blood samples from 2 T. aduncus (from Taiwan and Indonesia) and 2 T. truncatus (from Taiwan and Japan) were used for RACE-PCR. The presence of 1 DQB locus and 2 DRB loci in this genus was revealed, The presence of Tutr-DQB, Tuad-DRB, and Tutr-DRB suggests a functional role for these molecules in pathogen-specific immune responses. However, several features do not support a traditional role for Tuad-DQB molecules in peptide binding, and further study is needed. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sequence divergence of these 2 species might reflect different selective pressures between pathogens in oceanic (T. truncatus) and coastal (T. aduncus) waters. This study provides an essential foundation for analyzing variations in MHC genes and studying infectious disease ecology in bottlenose dolphins.\"'], ['The specific identification of anisakid larvae from fishes from the Yellow Sea, China, using mutation scanning-coupled sequence analysis of nuclear ribosomal DNA,\"By: Zhang, Luping; Hu, Min; Shamsi, Shokoofeh; et al.\",MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR PROBES  Volume: 21   Issue: 5-6   Pages: 386-390   Published: OCT-DEC 2007,\"Nematodes of the family Anisakidae parasitize fish, mammals, birds and reptiles, with the larval stages of some species causing severe clinical disease in humans. Therefore, the accurate identification of anisakid nematodes is a key component of disease surveillance and control. An epidemiological survey of 123 fishes comprising eight different species from the Yellow Sea in China revealed that more than 25% of fish were infected with the larvae of anisakids, 200 third-stage larvae (L3s) were collected from fish and then subjected to morphological and molecular study. Larvae identified as Anisakis type I (n = 197) and Hysterothylacium sp. (n = 3), based on morphological criteria were characterized genetically by mutation scanning, followed by targeted sequencing of the first and second internal transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Comparison of the sequences obtained from a subset of 27 specimens with those available in public gene databases showed that all samples identified morphologically as Anisakis type I (n = 197) were Anisakis pegreffii, whereas those identified as Hysterothylacium sp. (n = 3) were Hysterothylacium aduncum. The approach used herein was an effective means of matching incompletely identifiable larval nematodes with identifiable reference sequences, and provides a basis for exploring the composition of populations of anisakid larvae in fish as well as their ecology, particularly their life cycles and transmission patterns.

The disease causes high mortality and extirpations in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), which is of conservation concern because prairie dogs provide habitat for the critically endangered black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes). Our goal was to help elucidate the mechanism Y. pestis uses to persist in prairie ecosystems during enzootic and epizootic phases. We used a nested PCR protocol to assay for plague genomes in fleas collected from prairie dog burrows potentially exposed to plague in 1999 and 2000. No active plague epizootic was apparent in the 55 prairie dog colonies sampled in 2002 and 2003. However, 63% of the colonies contained plague-positive burrows in 2002, and 57% contained plague-positive burrows in 2003. Within plague-positive colonies, 23% of sampled burrows contained plague-positive fleas in 2002, and 26% contained plague-positive fleas in 2003. Of 15 intensively sampled colonies, there was no relationship between change in colony area and percentage of plague-positive burrows over the two years of the study. Some seasonality in plague prevalence was apparent because the highest percentages of plague-positive colonies were recorded in May and June. The surprisingly high prevalence of plague on study area colonies without any obvious epizootic suggested that the pathogen existed in an enzootic state in black-tailed prairie dogs. These findings have important implications for the management of prairie dogs and other species that are purported to be enzootic reservoir species.\"'], ['Northerly range extensions of mammalian species in Minnesota,\"By: Jannett, Frederick J., Jr.; Broschart, Michael R.; Grim, Leland H.; et al.\",AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST  Volume: 158   Issue: 1   Pages: 168-176   Published: JUL 2007,\"An inventory and monitoring program for species of non-volant small mammals was undertaken in Voyageurs National Park on the Minnesota-Canadian border.

We genotyped 192 Ethiopian wolves (n = 29 packs) in the Bale Mountains for 17 microsatellite loci to 1) elucidate kinship within and between packs, 2) assess parentage of pups, and 3) evaluate whether inbreeding is avoided by dispersal and/or mating behavior. Mean pairwise relatedness within packs (R = 0.39) was significantly greater than that estimated from random assignment of individuals to packs. However, breeding pairs were most often unrelated, suggesting that female-biased dispersal reduces inbreeding. We assigned maternity to 49 pups and paternity to 47 pups (n = 12 litters) rising a combination of exclusion, likelihood analyses (using CERVUS software), and sibship reconstruction. Multiple paternity occurred in 33% of litters; extrapack paternity accounted for 28% of all resolved paternities, occurring in 50% of litters. We found no evidence that extrapack copulations reduce inbreeding; however, more detailed analyses may elucidate the effect of recent population declines and demographic disturbances due to recurring disease outbreaks. The adaptive advantages of female-biased dispersal and the observed mating system are discussed in relation to Ethiopian wolf sociobiology and ecology.\"'], ['Avian influenza virus (H5N1): a threat to human health,\"By: Peiris, J.

The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 is already panzootic in poultry, with attendant economic consequences. It continues to cross species barriers to infect humans and other mammals, often with fatal outcomes. Therefore, H5N1 virus has lightly received attention as a potential pandemic threat. However, it is noted that the pandemics of 1957 and 1968 did not arise from highly pathogenic influenza viruses, and the next pandemic may well arise from a low-pathogenicity virus. The rationale for particular concern about an H5N1 pandemic is not its inevitability but its potential severity. An H5N1 pandemic is an event of low probability but one of high human health impact and poses a predicament for public health. Here, we review the ecology and evolution of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses, assess the pandemic risk, and address aspects of human H5N1 disease in relation to its epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management.\"'], ['Ecology and control of ticks as disease vectors in wildlife of the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania,\"By: Fyumagwa, Robert D.; Runyoro, Victor; Horak, Ivan G.; et al.\",SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH  Volume: 37   Issue: 1   Pages: 79-90   Published: APR 2007,\"Wild mammals in Africa mostly have high levels of innate resistance to haemoparasites and the tick vectors that transmit them. Occasionally though, biotic and abiotic factors combine to alter this relationship and tick-borne disease is diagnosed in wildlife. We postulate an inter-relationship between anthropogenic and natural factors that resulted in wildlife mortality, attributable to disease transmission associated with a gradual build-up of large numbers of ticks. Suppression of grassland fire for 27 years in a distinct ecological unit promoted a gradual expansion of areas covered by tall grass. Changes in composition of the pasture led to improved tick survival, which was further boosted by the availability of increasing numbers of a coarse-grazing species and preferred tick host, African buffalo. Alternating climatic cycles then appeared to precipitate an outbreak of tick-borne haemolytic disease by subjecting ticks and their herbivore hosts to ideal conditions ( in wet years) followed by starvation and immune suppression ( in dry years). Evidence supporting the hypothesis was gathered retrospectively in the present study through systematic sampling of tick density and correlating life stages of ticks to season, grass species and height of the grass sward. Tick host preference was noted by collection from immobilized wild animals and sympatric livestock. A long series of census data confirmed the changing composition of resident wild herbivores in the Ngorongoro Crater. To reduce the tick challenge, prescribed burning of the crater grassland was reintroduced; tick numbers fell rapidly and three years of subsequent monitoring confirmed the success of this strategy.\"'], ['Going wild: what a global small-animal tracking system could do for experimental biologists,\"By: Wikelski, Martin; Kays, Roland W.; Kasdin, N. Jeremy; et al.\",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY  Volume: 210   Issue: 2   Pages: 181-186   Published: JAN 15 2007,\"Tracking animals over large temporal and spatial scales has revealed invaluable and spectacular biological information, particularly when the paths and fates of individuals can be monitored on a global scale. However, only large animals (greater than similar to 300 g) currently can be followed globally because of power and size constraints on the tracking devices. And yet the vast majority of animals is small. Tracking small animals is important because they are often part of evolutionary and ecological experiments, they provide important ecosystem services and they are of conservation concern or pose harm to human health. Here, we propose a small-animal satellite tracking system that would enable the global monitoring of animals down to the size of the smallest birds, mammals (bats), marine life and eventually large insects. To create the scientific framework necessary for such a global project, we formed the ICARUS initiative (www.IcarusInitiative.org), the International Cooperation for Animal Research Using Space. ICARUS also highlights how small-animal tracking could address some of the \\'Grand Challenges in Environmental Sciences\\' identified by the US National Academy of Sciences, such as the spread of infectious diseases or the relationship between biological diversity and ecosystem functioning. Small-animal tracking would allow the quantitative assessment of dispersal and migration in natural populations and thus help solve enigmas regarding population dynamics, extinctions and invasions. Experimental biologists may find a global small-animal tracking system helpful in testing, validating and expanding laboratory-derived discoveries in wild, natural populations. We suggest that the relatively modest investment into a global small-animal tracking system will pay off by providing unprecedented insights into both basic and applied nature.Tracking small animals over large spatial and temporal scales could prove to be one of the most powerful techniques of the early 21st century, offering potential solutions to a wide range of biological and societal questions that date back two millennia to the Greek philosopher Aristotle\\'s enigma about songbird migration. Several of the more recent Grand Challenges in Environmental Sciences, such as the regulation and functional consequences of biological diversity or the surveillance of the population ecology of zoonotic hosts, pathogens or vectors, could also be addressed by a global small-animal tracking system.Our discussion is intended to contribute to an emerging groundswell of scientific support to make such a new technological system happen.\"'], ['Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida Trypanosomatidae): Ecology of the transmission cycle in the wild environment of the Andean valley of Cochabamba, Bolivia,\"By: Cortez, Mirko Rojas; Pinho, Ana Paula; Cuervo, Patricia; et al.\",EXPERIMENTAL PARASITOLOGY  Volume: 114   Issue: 4   Pages: 305-313   Published: DEC 2006,\"An active Trypanosoma cruzi transmission cycle maintained by wild rodents in the Andean valleys of Cochabamba Bolivia is described.

Phyllotis ocilae and the marsupial species Thylamys elegans, are the most important reservoirs followed by Bolomys lactens and Akodon boliviensis. In spite of both genotypes (TCI and TCII) being prevalent in Bolivia, in our study area only T. cruzi I is being transmitted. Our data suggest that wild T. infestans and wild small mammals play an important role in the maintenance of the transmission cycle of T. cruzi. Furthermore, the finding of high prevalence of T. cruzi infection in wild T. infestans point to the risk of the dispersion of Chagas\\' disease. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

More scientists are calling for a connection between medical and field research due to recent disease outbreaks in great apes, including Ebola, and indications of cross-transmission of Ebola and other viruses between primates and humans. A major limitation to progress is the lack of information on infectious diseases and their transmission in wild primates. Here, we present examples of successful pathogen detection in wild great apes and describe approaches and techniques that can be used in the field, focusing in particular on investigation of deaths and non-invasive sample collection. This interdisciplinary approach is providing new insights to infectious diseases of great apes and is helping to protect the health of great ape populations. This framework can also be applied to other mammals under threat from infectious diseases, including African wild dogs, seals and Tasmanian devils. In addition to providing benefits for great ape conservation, research that integrates infectious disease with primate ecology provides insights to emerging diseases in humans and the role of disease in primate evolution.

We used satellite imagery to produce several spatial variables that described landscape; however, only slope was consistently related to abundances of the two most dominant rodent species. Using regression, we constructed a spatial model of areas of Z. brevicauda dominance, which in turn relates to higher infection rates. The model predicts highest abundances of Z. brevicauda in flat areas, where humans also dominate.

Not surprisingly, then, the species diversity of ecological communities can potentially affect the prevalence of infectious diseases. Although a number of studies have now identified effects of diversity on disease prevalence, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear in many cases. Starting with simple epidemiological models, we describe a suite of mechanisms through which diversity could increase or decrease disease risk, and illustrate the potential applicability of these mechanisms for both vector-borne and non-vector-borne diseases, and for both specialist and generalist pathogens. We review examples of how these mechanisms may operate in specific disease systems. Because the effects of diversity on multi-host disease systems have been the subject of much recent research and controversy, we describe several recent efforts to delineate under what general conditions host diversity should increase or decrease disease prevalence, and illustrate these with examples. Both models and literature reviews suggest that high host diversity is more likely to decrease than increase disease risk. Reduced disease risk with increasing host diversity is especially likely when pathogen transmission is frequency-dependent, and when pathogen transmission is greater within species than between species, particularly when the most competent hosts are also relatively abundant and widespread. We conclude by identifying focal areas for future research, including (1) describing patterns of change in disease risk with changing diversity; (2) identifying the mechanisms responsible for observed changes in risk; (3) clarifying additional mechanisms in a wider range of epidemiological models; and (4) experimentally manipulating disease systems to assess the impact of proposed mechanisms.\"'], ['Habitat structure associated with Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence in small mammals in New York State,\"By: Prusinski, MA; Chen, HY; Drobnack, JM; et al.\",ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY  Volume: 35   Issue: 2   Pages: 308-319   Published: APR 2006,\"The relationship between habitat structural composition, presence of Ixodes scapularis Say (I. dammini Spielman, Clifford, Piesman, and Corwin), and the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi infection in small mammal populations was studied at 12 4-ba study sites selected within two perpendicular transects spanning New York State. Species-adjusted small mammal infection rates (SARs) were calculated to enable comparison of B. burgdorferi infection rates among sites with differing small mammal species composition and were used as the outcome variable in a predictive model. Sites with high SARs were characterized by lower overstory tree canopy height and basal area, increased understory coverage, substantial understory shrub coverage, decreased presence of surface water or saturated soil, high dominance values for I. scapularis, and higher tick burdens on small mammals, These differences were statistically significant from sites with moderate or low SAR values. Understory foliage height profiles were created for each study site, and significant differences in vegetation structural composition between high SAR sites and those with low or moderate SAR were documented. High SAR sites had increased density of herbaceous foliage at 0 and 25 cm, and higher shrub density at 0, 25, and 50 cm measurements above the ground, associated with I.scapularis questing success, and lower densities of sapling trees at 25, 50, and 75 cm.

The aim of this paper is to review alternative biogeographic approaches in the context of spatial analysis. Biogeography can be used to set priorities for conservation of biological diversity, but also to design strategies to control biological invasions and vectors of human diseases, to provide information about the former distribution of species, and to guide development of ecological restoration initiatives, among other applications. But no one of these applications could be fully carried out until an integrative framework on biogeography, which bridges biogeographical historical and ecological paths of thinking, has been developed. Although we do not propose a new biogeographic method, we highlight the causes and consequences of the lack of a conceptual framework integrating ecology and history in biogeography, and how this required framework would allow biogeography to be fully utilised in fields such as conservation.\"'], ['Chemical ecology in wheat plant-pest interactions.

The project was financed by the European Commission in the 5th Framework Programme and involved agronomists, biologists, analytical chemists, organic chemists, environmental chemists, ecotoxicologists, and modelers. Benzoxazinones from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were the main group of compounds studied in the project. The project showed that future assessments of an extensive use of allelopathic crops must include the development of validated analytical methods, considerations of relevant concentrations, studies on soil transformation, ecotoxicological studies on individual compounds and mixtures, evaluation on human and mammal toxicity, and joint effect studies on weeds, insects, and pathogens. The project results clearly showed the relevance of optimizing the exploitation of cereal benzoxazinones. Crop rotation is a very traditional practice, which was given less importance for decades but is now regaining its importance in agricultural practice as a means of controlling weed seed banks and soilborne diseases and pests. When using cereals as catch crops and green manure, the allelopathic properties of the cereals could now be much more extensively exploited, choosing varieties with optimal production of benzoxazinones and optimizing the time of sowing in relation to the formation of bioactive metabolites.\"'], ['Short report: Absence of Leishmania in Guianan bats,\"By: Rotureau, B; Catzeflis, F; Carme, B\",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE  Volume: 74   Issue: 2   Pages: 318-321   Published: FEB 2006,\"Studying the ecology of Leishmania parasites is essential for understanding and controlling the epidemiology of the diseases they cause.

Thus, 216 bats representing 29 species were sampled in the field in different primary and secondary forests of French Guiana where human cutaneous leishmaniases have been reported, together with 62 non-volant mammals. A series of 411 tissue samples representing 47 mammalian species were cultured and screened for the presence of Leishmania spp. by a genus-specific polymerase chain reaction.

Urgent and considerable efforts must be made from now on to cataloge, understand, preserve, and enhance the value of biodiversity while ensuring food safety and human and animal health. Ambitious integrated and multifield research programs must be implemented in order to understand the causes and anticipate the consequences of loss of biodiversity. Such losses are a serious threat to sustainable development and to the quality of life of future generations. They have an influence on the natural balance of global biodiversity in particularly in reducing the capability of species to adapt rapidly by genetic mutations to survive in modified ecosystems. Usually, the natural immune systems of mammals (both human and animal), are highly polymorphic and able to adapt rapidly to new situations. We more specifically discuss the fact that if the genetic diversity of the affected populations is low the invading microorganisms, will suddenly expand and create epidemic outbreaks with risks of pandemic. So biodiversity appears to function as an important barrier (buffer), especially against disease-causing organisms, which can function in different ways. Finally, we discuss the importance of preserving biodiversity mainly in the wildlife ecosystems as an integrated and sustainable approach among others in order to prevent and control the emergence or reemergence of diseases in animals and humans (zoonosis). Although plants are also part of this paradigm, they fall outside our field of study.\"'], ['An ecological field study of the water-rat Nectomys squamipes as a wild reservoir indicator of Schistosoma mansoni transmission in an endemic area,\"By: Gentile, Rosana; Costa-Neto, Socrates F.; Goncalves, Margareth M.

The aims of this study were: to investigate the infection rates by S. mansoni on the water-rat Nectomys squamipes during four years in endemic areas of Sumidouro, state of Rio de Janeiro, using mark-recapture technique; to compare two diagnostic methods for schistosomiasis; and to evaluate the effects of the chemotherapy in the human infected population on the rodent infection rates. The rodent infection rates of S. mansoni increased when rodent population sizes were lower Coprology and serology results presented the same trends along time and were correlated Serology could detect recent infection, including the false negatives in the coprology. The chemotherapy in the humans could not interrupt the rodent infection. Rodents can increase the schistosomiaisis transmission where it already exists, they probably maintain the transmission cycle in the nature and can be considered as biological indicators of the transmission sites of this parasite since they are highly susceptible to infection. The water-rats may present different levels of importance in the transmission dynamics of S. mansoni infection cycle for each area, and can be considered important wild-reservoirs of this human disease.\"'], ['Transmission ecology of Echinococcus multilocularis: What are the ranges of parasite stability among various host communities in China?,\"By: Giraudoux, P; Pleydell, D; Raoul, F; et al.\",PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL  Volume: 55   Supplement: S   Pages: S237-S246   Published: 2006,\"A striking feature of the transmission ecology of Echinococcus multilocularis in China is the diversity of hosts that contribute to the parasite cycle. Considering the population dynamics of key reservoir intermediate hosts and the ratio of their preferred habitat in a landscape (ROMPA) is essential to understanding transmission, but the numerous communities in which the parasite cycles and the extent of those communities is currently far from being fully documented. On the Tibetan plateau grassland management influences intermediate host species populations and the sheer size of the area could be a major contributing factor to sustaining transmission in the region. In Southern Gansu and Southern Ningxia the processes of deforestation have temporarily provided optimal habitat for key reservoir intermediate hosts of E. multilocularis, resulting in high transmission and human disease, however currently the parasite may be extinct locally. Faced with this pattern of potentially transient transmission in a diversity of communities the question of the dispersal potential of the parasite arises. The reforestation program currently active across much of Western China has the potential to give rise to a massive increase in habitat favourable to suitable intermediate hosts and emergence or re-emergence of the zoonosis alveolar echinococcosis in many areas. This potential epidemic could be mitigated by both natural and human induced parasite dispersal mechanisms including fox migration and the sale of infected dogs originating from stable endemic foci on the Tibetan plateau. However, currently the degree of genetic exchange between discrete transmission foci is unknown and it is expected that genetic techniques could provide crucial information regarding this important question.

Ten countries in Asia and several other countries in Eastern Europe suffer high losses from the lethal effects of these viruses of the H5N1 subtype. AIV of other subtypes cause in additional countries severe losses. The threat to health and well-being of the avifauna, domestic poultry and possibly mammals including humans are worldwide of major concern. The European Union reacted with a complete import ban on untreated meat, eggs, poultry products as well as free-living and pet birds. Extensive surveillance of free-living birds and domestic poultry that is maintained in free-range and close to open waters were initiated in an attempt to gather information on the current status of infection with these viruses and to target appropriate countermeasures for the protection of domestic poultry (in-house keeping) and to safeguard food production for humans. Since the monitoring of free-living birds is labour-intensive, costly, and time-consuming, only birds should be included in the monitoring programme that harboured in the past most if not all influenza A viruses. The birds of the order Anatiformes, family Anatidae, subfamilies Ansennae and Anatinae, provided 65.9% of all avian AIV isolates. The cosmopolitan Common Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is the dominant species with the highest rate of isolations among all bird species. Second in frequency is the North-American Blue-winged Teal (Spatula discors). Consequently, free-living anatiform birds of the genera Anas and Spatula should comprise the main focus for the collection of cloacal and pharyngeal swabs. With the likely exception of the most recent H5N1 viruses, signs of disease were not recorded in AIV infected anatiform birds. AIV isolations were definitely less frequently obtained from birds of the orders Phasianiformes (including domestic chickens and turkeys), Charadriformes (plovers and lapwings), Lariformes (gulls), Columbiformes (pigeons) and Psittaciformes (psittacines) and need less attention in sampling efforts. This review presents also data on taxonomy and most suitable means for isolation and typing of haemagglutinating viruses. The different frequencies of the detection of 16 haemagglutinin (HA) subtypes and 9 subtypes of neuraminidase (NA) surface antigens are composed on the basis of extensive literature retrievals. Both antigens occure in isolates at different frequencies. Only 103 of all 144 possible HA x NA combinations were described so far. The AIV that contain the HA subtypes H3, H4, H6 are most frequently isolated whereas the AIV of the subtypes H5 and H7 were less frequently encountered. All other HAs are rather rare. AIV that possess the NA of the subtypes N2, N1, N8 and N3 are frequent and all other NAs are rarely detected.\"'], ['Hidden effects of chronic tuberculosis in African buffalo,\"By: Jolles, AE; Cooper, DV; Levin, SA\",ECOLOGY  Volume: 86   Issue: 9   Pages: 2358-2364   Published: SEP 2005,\"Infectious diseases can bring, about population declines and local host extinctions, contributing significantly to the global biodiversity crisis. Nonetheless, studies measuring population-level effects of pathogens in wild host populations are rare, and taxonomically biased toward avian hosts and macroparasitic infections. We investigated the effects of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by the bacterial pathogen. Mycobacterium bovis, on African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) at Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa. We tested 1180 buffalo for bTB infection between May 2000 and November 2001. Most infections were mild, confirming the chronic nature of the disease in buffalo. However, our data indicate that bTB affects both adult survival and fecundity. Using an age-structured population model, we demonstrate that the pathogen can reduce population growth rate drastically; yet its effects appear difficult to detect at the population level: bTB causes no conspicuous mass mortalities or fast population declines, nor does it alter host-population age structure significantly. Our models suggest that this syndrome-low detectability coupled with severe impacts on population growth rate and, therefore, resilience-may be characteristic of chronic diseases in large mammals.\"'], ['The role of feral mammals on wildlife infectious disease prevalence in two nature reserves within Mexico City limits,\"By: Suzan, G; Ceballos, G\",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE  Volume: 36   Issue: 3   Pages: 479-484   Published: SEP 2005,\"Wild and feral medium-sized mammals were live trapped at two natural protected areas within the Mexico City limits to determine antibody prevalence for the most common infectious diseases (rabies, toxoplasmosis, and canine parvovirus) in dogs and cats. Mammals were trapped during the dry (March-April) and rainy seasons (July-August) of 1996 and 1997. A total of 68 individuals were captured, representing 8 species: opossums (Didelphis virginiana), ringtails (Bassariscus astutus), spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis), weasels (Mustela frenata), rock squirrels (Spermophilus variegatus), Mexican gray squirrels (Sciurus aureogaster), feral cats (Felis catus), and feral dogs (Canis familiaris). There was marked seroprevalence for parvovirus (86.6%) and lower seroprevalences for both toxoplasma (23.9%) and rabies (17.9%). There were no significant prevalence differences among mammals in both protected areas, which were of contrasting size and isolation (i.e., small and isolated versus large and nonisolated). We suggest that high seroprevalence of these three infectious agents in wild mammals is a result of the high densities of feral dogs and cats in the two areas sampled. Feral dogs are able to maintain the infectious agents in these localities regardless of the protected area size and isolation. However, the native mammals of the small and isolated reserve are more vulnerable to infectious diseases because of small population size and genetic bottlenecks. Our results indicate that natural areas in and around Mexico City are a refugium for latent infectious agents, several of which are zoonotic. These findings suggest that conservation measures, such as eradication of feral mammals and vaccination programs, in the protected areas and surrounding areas could be beneficial.\"'], ['Origins of Chagas disease: Didelphis species are natural hosts of Trypanosoma cruzi I and armadillos hosts of Trypanosoma cruzi II, including hybrids,\"By: Yeo, M; Acosta, N; Llewellyn, M; et al.\",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY  Volume: 35   Issue: 2   Pages: 225-233   Published: FEB 2005,\"Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, has at least two principal intraspecific subdivisions, T. cruzi I (TCI) and T cruzi II (TCII), the latter containing up to five subgroups (a-e).

Here, we present compelling evidence of an association between TO and opossums (Didelphis), and TCII and armadillos, on the basis of key new findings from the Paraguayan Chaco region, together with a comprehensive analysis of historical data. We suggest that the distinct arboreal and terrestrial ecologies, respectively, of these mammal hosts provide a persuasive explanation for the extant T cruzi intraspecific diversity in South America, and for separate origins of Chagas disease in northern South America and in the southern cone countries.

When the initial number of potentially invasive or infectious individuals is small, demographic stochasticity can lead to rapid extinction, Suggesting that the transient dynamics of establishment for invasive species and epidemics should be modeled as a stochastic process. Quantitative risk assessment can exploit this conceptualization to calculate risk metrics such as the chance of invasion or epidemic and to study the potential effectiveness of rapid response interventions. Here I review some simple establishment models and demonstrate how understanding the underlying stochastic processes can lead to more effective policies for risk management. As examples, I study the dynamics of feral nutria (Myocastor coypus) in East Anglia, UK, and infection by bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium, bovis) in various species. Nutria are fur-bearing aquatic mammals that have been introduced around the world intentionally and through escape front farms and cause severe damage to marsh vegetation. Bovine tubers culosis is a chronic wasting disease of diverse mammal species and results in long term emaciation and decline in animal fitness. I find that both nutria and bovine tuberculosis exhibit high intrinsic rates of increase as measured by their increase in abundance when the may affect the chance of establishment population or epidemic is small. While Allee effects for nutria, analysis of additional data will be required to reject the hypothesis that nutria dynamics follow the simple Ricker growth model. The distinction is important, however, as the estimated chance of establishment under the Allee effect model is considerably less than under the Ricker model for introduced populations less than about 850 individuals. The chance of bovine tuberculosis epidemic for introductions of small numbers of individuals infectious with bovine tuberculosis in populations of brush tail possums (Trichosarus vulpecula) or badgers (Meles meles) is high. Thus, if surveillance programs are not almost completely effective at preventing introductions of infectious individuals, periodic outbreaks are likely to Occur.

P. clarkii lacks efficient dispersal mechanisms but is very well adapted to the ecological conditions of Mediterranean wetlands (fluctuating hydroperiods with regular intervals of drought). As an opportunistic, omnivorous species, which adapts its ecology and life history characteristics, such as timing and size at reproduction to changing environmental conditions, it became readily established in most of the Mediterranean wetland environments. High reproductive output, short development time and a flexible feeding strategy are responsible for its success as an invader. Like most crayfish, it occupies a keystone position in the trophic web of the invaded system and interacts strongly with various trophic levels. It efficiently grazes on macrophytes and is one of the main factors, besides the impact of flamingos, cattle and introduced fish, of the change of many water bodies from a macrophyte dominated, clear water equilibrium to a phytoplankton driven turbid water balance. Juveniles feed on protein rich animal food with the corresponding impact on the macroinvertebrate community in competition with other crayfish or fish species. At the same time, it serves as a prey for mammals, birds and fish. Due to its predatory and grazing activity, it efficiently canalises energy pathways reducing food web complexity and structure. Feeding also on detritus it opens, especially in marshlands, the detritic food chain to higher trophic levels which results in an increase of crayfish predators. As a vector of diseases, it has a severe impact on the preservation and reintroduction of native crayfish. P. clarkii accumulates heavy metals and other pollutants in its organs and body tissues and transmits them to higher trophic levels. Due to the long history of its presence, the complex interactions it established within the invaded ecosystems and the socio-economic benefits it provides to humans, prevention and control seem the most promising management measures to reduce the negative impact of this crayfish species.\"'], ['Ecological epidemiology: the role of landscape structure in the transmission risk of the fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis (Leukart 1863) (Cestoda : Cyclophyllidea : Taeniidae),\"By: Graham, AJ; Danson, FM; Craig, PS\",PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY  Volume: 29   Issue: 1   Pages: 77-91   Published: JAN 2005,\"The larval form of the fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis causes a fatal liver infection in humans and has high prevalence in western China.

Densities of nymphal ticks were greater in deciduous than coniferous woods in 3 of 7 yr. Only engorged ticks survived the winter, and overwintering survival of engorged larvae in experimental enclosures did not differ between deciduous and coniferous woods. Nymphs were not always most abundant in the same forest type as they had been as larvae, and the habitat shift between life stages differed in direction in different years. Therefore, forest type by itself did not account for tick distribution patterns. Nymphal densities were lower where deer had been excluded compared with areas with deer present for 3 yr after exclusion, suggesting that movement patterns of vertebrate hosts influenced tick distribution, but nymphal densities increased dramatically in one of the enclosures in the fourth year. Therefore, movements of ticks on animal hosts apparently contribute substantially to tick spatial distribution among woodland types, but the factor(s) that determine spatial distribution of nymphal I. scapularis shift from year to year.\"'], ['West Nile: worldwide current situation in animals and humans,\"By: Dauphin, G; Zientara, S; Zeller, H; et al.\",COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES  Volume: 27   Issue: 5   Pages: 343-355   Published: SEP 2004,\"West Nile (WN) virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is native to Africa, Europe, and Western Asia.

First Naegleria fowleri, then Acanthamoeba spp. and Balamuthia mandrillaris, and finally Sappinia diploidea have been recognised as etiologic agents of encephalitis; Acanthamoeba spp. are also responsible for amoebic keratitis. Some of the infections are opportunistic, occurring mainly in immunocompromised hosts (Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia encephalitides), while others are non-opportunistic (Acanthamoeba keratitis, Naegleria meningoencephalitis, and cases of Balamuthia encephalitis occurring in immunocompetent humans). The amoebae have a cosmopolitan distribution in soil and water, providing multiple opportunities for contacts with humans and animals, as evidenced by antibody titers in surveyed human populations. Although, the numbers of infections caused by these amoebae are low in comparison to other protozoal parasitoses (trypanosomiasis, toxoplasmosis, malaria, etc.), the difficulty in diagnosing them, the challenge of finding optimal antimicrobial treatments and the morbidity and relatively high mortality associated with, in particular, the encephalitides have been a cause for concern for clinical and laboratory personnel and parasitologists. This review presents information about the individual amoebae: their morphologies and life-cycles, laboratory cultivation, ecology, epidemiology, nature of the infections and appropriate antimicrobial therapies, the immune response, and molecular diagnostic procedures that have been developed for identification of the amoebae in the environment and in clinical specimens.

Previous studies suggest a recent increase in marine disease. However, lack of baseline data in most communities prevents a direct test of this hypothesis. We developed a proxy to evaluate a prediction of the increasing disease hypothesis: the proportion of scientific publications reporting disease increased in recent decades. This represents, to our knowledge, the first quantitative use of normalized trends in the literature to investigate an ecological hypothesis. We searched a literature database for reports of parasites and disease (hereafter \"\"disease\"\") in nine marine taxonomic groups from 1970 to 2001. Reports, normalized for research effort, increased in turtles, corals, mammals, urchins, and molluscs. No significant trends were detected for seagrasses, decapods, or sharks/rays (though disease occurred in these groups). Counter to the prediction, disease reports decreased in fishes. Formulating effective resource management policy requires understanding the basis and timing of marine disease events. Why disease outbreaks increased in some groups but not in others should be a priority for future investigation. The increase in several groups lends urgency to understanding disease dynamics, particularly since few viable options currently exist to mitigate disease in the oceans.\"'], ['High MHC diversity maintained by balancing selection in an otherwise genetically monomorphic mammal,\"By: Aguilar, A; Roemer, G; Debenham, S; et al.\",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  Volume: 101   Issue: 10   Pages: 3490-3494   Published: MAR 9 2004,\"The San Nicolas Island fox (Urocyon littoralis dickeyi) is genetically the most monomorphic sexually reproducing animal population yet reported and has no variation in hypervariable genetic markers. Such low levels of variation imply lower resistance to pathogens, reduced fitness, and problems in distinguishing kin from non-kin. In vertebrates, the MHC contains genes that influence disease resistance and kin recognition and may be under intense balancing selection in some populations. Hence, genetic variation at the MHC might persist despite the extreme monomorphism shown by neutral markers. We examine variation of five loci within the MHC of San Nicolas Island foxes and find remarkably high levels of variation. Further, we show by simulation that genetic monomorphism at neutral loci and high MHC variation could arise only through an extreme population bottleneck of 10 individuals, approximate to10-20 generations ago, accompanied by unprecedented selection coefficients of 0.5 on MHC loci. These results support the importance of balancing selection as a mechanism to maintain variation in natural populations and expose the difficulty of using neutral markers as surrogates for variation in fitness-related loci.\"'], ['The status of dwarf carnivores on Cozumel Island, Mexico,\"By: Cuaron, AD; Martinez-Morales, MA; McFadden, KW; et al.\",BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION  Volume: 13   Issue: 2   Pages: 317-331   Published: FEB 2004,\"Cozumel Island in the Mexican Caribbean is inhabited by four carnivores, of which two, the Cozumel coati Nasua nelsoni and pygmy raccoon Procyon pygmaeus, are endemic species. The taxonomic status of a third carnivore, a dwarf gray fox Urocyon cinereoargenteus, is undetermined, but may deserve subspecific or species- level recognition. The fourth species, the kinkajou ( Potos flavus), may be a recent introduction. We review the status of these carnivores, report our field observations and results of line transect and trapping efforts, discuss current threats to these taxa, and make recommendations for their conservation. A population density of 0.43 +/- 0.27 coatis / km(2), and a total island population size of 150 +/- 95 individuals, was estimated from 386 km of line transects in 1994 - 1995. Intensive trapping efforts ( 1479 trap- nights) in 2001 at multiple localities were unsuccessful. Pygmy raccoons were observed in the mangrove and coastal wetland areas of the island and in 2001 we captured 11 individuals with the same sampling efforts as for coatis ( 8.8 raccoons/ 1000 trap- nights). The gray fox is also apparently very rare on the island. While a few observations of the animals have been made ( 1984, 1994 and 2001), no animals were seen along transects and none were trapped. The primary threats to the persistence of these taxa include introduced congeners, introduced predators, parasite and disease spill- over from exotic animals, habitat fragmentation, hunting and collection as pets, and hurricanes. We suggest that the Cozumel coati, pygmy raccoon, and the Cozumel population of the gray fox be considered as Critically Endangered according to the IUCN classification system. Current conservation actions focusing on Cozumel carnivores are extremely limited. We recommend eradication of introduced species, maintenance of habitat connectivity, ex situ conservation programs, explicit public policies on land- use and sustainable development, public awareness campaigns, and continuous scientific research and monitoring.\"'], ['Anti-Borrelia antibodies in rodents: Important hosts in ecology of Lyme disease,\"By: Stefancikova, A; Bhide, M; Pet\\'ko, B; et al.\",ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE  Volume: 11   Issue: 2   Pages: 209-213   Published: 2004,\"Data presented in this study focuses on the presence of anti-Borrelia antibodies in small mammals from Eastern Slovakia during 2000-2003.

The notion that ratadas are associated with bamboo flowering and subsequent mast seeding at cycles of 30 years has appeared in the literature since the late 1800s. Based on 63 well-documented cases, we show that not only are ratadas associated with bamboo blooming, but also many are associated with rainfall peaks, and that these two outbreak types are geographically interspersed over South America. In addition, we dispel the notion that South American bamboo blooms occur every 30 years, which may only be the case for Merostachys fistulosa . For other species the modal cycles occur every 14 (Merostachys spp.), 12 (Chusquea quila and/or valdiviensis) or 14 years (Chusquea coleou). We also propose the hypothesis that rainfall-associated ratadas are ultimately caused by the occurrence of El Nino, and discuss the possible population dynamic mechanisms underlying rodent outbreaks in South America. Aiming at setting a standardized framework for spatial and temporal comparisons, we propose a trapping protocol and a threshold density for assigning the \\'ratada\\' label. Several of the mice implicated in ratadas are reservoirs of emerging diseases, thus emphasizing the need for predictive power to forecast disease epidemics that affect human populations. Further, ratadas may be viewed as pulsed resources, thus enabling us to learn more of the ways communities respond to such intermittent inputs.\"'], ['The fin whale Balaenoptera physalus (L. 1758) in the Mediterranean Sea,\"By: Notarbartolo-di-Sciara, G; Zanardelli, M; Jahoda, M; et al.\",MAMMAL REVIEW  Volume: 33   Issue: 2   Pages: 105-150   Published: JUN 2003,\"1. The ecology and status of fin whales Balaenoptera physalus in the Mediterranean Sea is reviewed. The species\\' presence, morphology, distribution, movements, population structure, ecology and behaviour in this semi-enclosed marine region are summarized, and the review is complemented with original, previously unpublished data.2. Although the total size of the fin whale population in the Mediterranean is unknown, an estimate for a portion of the western basin, where most of the whales are known to live, was approximately 3500 individuals. High whale densities, comparable to those found in rich oceanic habitats, were found in well-defined areas of high productivity. Most whales concentrate in the Ligurian-Corsican-Provencal Basin, where their presence is particularly noticeable during summer; however, neither their movement patterns throughout the region nor their seasonal cycle are clear.3. Based on genetic studies, fin whales from the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from North Atlantic conspecifics, and may constitute a resident population, separate from those of the North Atlantic, despite the species\\' historical presence in the Strait of Gibraltar. Fin whales are known to calve in the Mediterranean, with births peaking in November but occurring at lower rates throughout the year. They feed primarily on krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica which they capture by diving to depths in excess of 470 m. It is suggested that the extensive vertical migratory behaviour of its main prey may have influenced the social ecology of this population.4. Known causes of mortality and threats, including collisions with vessels, entanglement in fishing gear, deliberate killing, disturbance, pollution and disease, are listed and discussed in view of the implementation of appropriate conservation measures to ensure the species\\' survival in the region.\"'], ['Canine distemper virus in river otters in British Columbia as an emergent risk for coastal pinnipeds,\"By: Mos, L; Ross, PS; McIntosh, D; et al.\",VETERINARY RECORD  Volume: 152   Issue: 8   Pages: 237-239   Published: FEB 22 2003,No Abstract Found'], ['Songbird populations in fluctuating environments: Predator responses to pulsed resources,\"By: Schmidt, KA; Ostfeld, RS\",ECOLOGY  Volume: 84   Issue: 2   Pages: 406-415   Published: FEB 2003,\"In response to mast production of acorns, populations of small mammals, such as the white-footed mouse and eastern chipmunk, greatly increase and, in turn, initiate cascades of direct and indirect effects that permeate throughout forest communities. To examine the strength of the effects stemming from acorn crops, we conducted studies in oak-dominated deciduous forest of the Hudson Valley, New York, documenting the connections between predator abundance (small mammals,and raptors) and the abundance and reproductive success of five woodland songbirds. Nest predation rates increased at high rodent densities for Veeries, Red-eyed Vireos, and Wood Thrushes. Analysis of Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data from surrounding counties demonstrated a unimodal relationship between rodent density (year t) and songbird abundance (year t + 1), rather than a monotonic decline. Regional Christmas Bird Count data for Sharp-shinned and Cooper\\'s Hawks showed a positive correlation between rodent density and accipiter abundance the following winter, suggesting that hawks exhibit A numerical response to rodents. Taken together, we suggest that predation by accipiters when rodents are scarce, in combination with high nest predation when rodents are abundant, may explain the unimodal relationship between rodents and Songbirds. Nonlinear relationships between predator and prey abundance and indirect interactions appear to characterize this system.\"'], ['Bartonella infection in sylvatic small mammals of central Sweden,\"By: Holmberg, M; Mills, JN; McGill, S; et al.\",EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION  Volume: 130   Issue: 1   Pages: 149-157   Published: FEB 2003,\"Sylvatic small mammals were captured in rural habitats near Uppsala, Sweden, to measure the prevalence of bartonella infections, characterize bacterial isolates and identify their host range, and increase our understanding of host-pathogen ecology.

Five of the 6 genotypes were most similar to other known bartonella isolated from Old World small-mammal hosts. The most frequent genotype (83 %) was isolated from A. flavicollis and M. musculus and was identical to Bartonella grahamii, a recently demonstrated human pathogen. These two hosts were most frequently captured in and around human structures and work places, thus providing conditions that could potentially lead to frequent human infections.\"'], ['Echinococcosis: disease, detection and transmission,\"By: Craig, PS; Rogan, MT; Campos-Ponce, M\",PARASITOLOGY  Volume: 127   Supplement: S   Pages: S5-S20   Published: 2003,\"Echinococcosis is one of the world\\'s most geographically widespread parasitic zoonoses, with transmission occurring in tropical, temperate and arctic biomes. Most human infections are due to Echinococcus granulosus transmitted between domestic dogs and livestock, but this cosmopolitan species also cycles between wild carnivores (principally canids) and wild ungulates. The other species with significant zoonotic potential is E. multilocularis that occurs naturally in fox definitive hosts and small mammal intermediate hosts. These two species cause human cystic or alveolar echinococcosis respectively, which may be considered serious public health problems in several regions including developed countries.

This suggests that at the regional scale landscape can affect human disease distribution through interaction with small mammal communities and their population dynamics.

Here we review published and unpublished information on its distribution, ecology, impact, and control. Wasmannia auropunctata occurs throughout most of the warmer parts of the New World, from subtropical Argentina to subtropical Mexico and through much of the Caribbean, though it is not clear whether this species is native to this entire region. During the past century, exotic populations of W. auropunctata have become established in numerous other places, including the Galapagos Islands, West Africa (Gabon, Cameroon, and possibly the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo), Melanesia (New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and possibly Tuvalu), Polynesia (Wallis and Futuna and Hawaii), the mainland US (Florida and possibly California), and on subtropical Atlantic islands (the Bahamas and Bennuda). The latitudinal range of known outdoors populations of W. auropunctata is from 32degrees40\\'S in Argentina to 32degrees20\\'N in Bermuda. Wasmannia auropunctata is also a greenhouse pest in more temperate regions, such as England and Canada. In many areas, W. auropunctata can be a significant agricultural pest, not only stinging agricultural workers, but also enhancing populations of Homoptera. Homoptera cause damage both through sapping plants of nutrients and by increasing the occurrence of diseases, including viral and fungal infections. In addition, W. auropunctata has negative impacts on many animals, both invertebrates and vertebrates, though most reports on such impact have been anecdotal. The impacts of W. auropunctata populations seem to be most severe on tropical islands where it is not native, such as the Galapagos, New Caledonia, and the Solomon Islands. Reports of widespread blindness in both domestic and native mammals caused by W. auropunctata stings deserve serious attention. Chemical control of W auropunctata may be possible for small exotic populations spread over a few dozen hectares or less. For large exotic infestations, the only hope for long-term control appears to be classical biocontrol.\"'], ['An Mhc component to kin recognition and mate choice in birds: Predictions, progress, and prospects,\"By: Zelano, B; Edwards, SV\",AMERICAN NATURALIST  Volume: 160   Supplement: S   Pages: S225-S237   Published: DEC 2002,\"The major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) has been identified as a locus influencing disease resistance, mate choice, and kin recognition in mammals and fish. However, it is unclear whether the mechanisms by which Mhc genes influence behavior in mammals are applicable to other nonmammalian vertebrates such as birds. We review the biology of Mhc genes with particular reference to their relevance to avian mating and social systems. New genomics approaches recently have been applied to the Mhcs of chickens, quail, and several icons of avian behavioral ecology, including red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus). The predominance of concerted evolution at avian Mhc loci makes such methods attractive for providing access to this complicated multigene family. Although some biological processes influenced by Mhc in mammals are physiologically implausible for birds, Mhc could influence cues that form well-known bases for mate choice in birds by influencing the health and vigor of individuals. The tight associations of Mhc variation and disease resistance in chickens raise hope that finding associations of Mhc genes, disease, and mate choice in natural populations of birds will be as fruitful as in mammalian systems.\"'], ['Availability of food resources, distribution of invasive species, and conservation of a Hawaiian bird along a gradient of elevation,\"By: Banko, PC; Oboyski, PT; Slotterback, JW; et al.\",JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY  Volume: 29   Issue: 5-6   Pages: 789-808   Published: MAY-JUN 2002,\"Aim We evaluated how an elevation gradient affects: (1) the availability of food required by a specialist seed-eater, Loxioides bailleui Oustalet (Drepanidinae), or palila, and hence the distribution of this endangered Hawaiian bird, and (2) the distribution of alien threats to Loxioides populations, their primary foods, and their dry-forest habitat, and hence strategies for their conservation.Location We worked throughout the subalpine forest that encircles Mauna Kea Volcano, Hawaii Island, but we focused our studies mainly on the western slope between 2000 and 3000 m elevation, where the gradient of elevation was greatest and palila were most abundant.Methods We determined phenology and productivity patterns of the endemic dry-forest tree species, Sophora chrysophylla (Salisb.) Seem. (Fabaceae), or mamane, which provides Loxioides with most of their food, and another common endemic tree, Myoporum sandwicense A. Gray (Myoporaceae), or naio, which provides some resources, along a 786-m elevation gradient at monthly intervals for 10 years (Sophora only). We also determined the availability each month of moth larvae (Lepidoptera) for that were important in the diet of nestling and adult palila. In addition, we documented the incidence of parasitism on moth larvae by several wasp (Hymenoptera) and fly (Diptera) species, and we determined the distribution of predatory wasps and ants (Hymenoptera), which potentially threaten insect prey of birds. Percentage cover of alien grass species that pose fire threats in palila habitat and other weeds were assessed during one survey. Small mammal abundance and distribution were determined by trapping during three (rodent) or five (carnivore) surveys.Results Sophora flower and seed (pod) availability varied predictably along the elevation gradient, with about 4 months separating peaks in reproduction at high and low elevations. This, together with highly variable production of flowers and pods within elevation strata, resulted in Sophora resources being available to Loxioides throughout the year on the western slope of Mauna Kea. Sophora produced flowers and pods more seasonally where gradients of elevation were short; thus, resources were available less consistently. In contrast, Myoporum produced flowers and fruits with little variation with respect to season or elevation. The availability of important insect prey of Loxioides was also related to elevation, in part because threats to Lepidoptera larvae from parasitic wasps were generally less at higher elevations. Threats to insect prey from predatory ants was also less at higher elevations but the abundance of predatory wasps was not related to elevation. Several weeds that pose the most serious threats to Loxioides habitat were more abundant at mid and low elevations, and alien grass cover was somewhat greater at mid elevation, thereby increasing fire risks in the centre of Loxioides habitat. Predatory mammals, in particular Felis catus Linnaeus, were common throughout the subalpine forest of Mauna Kea. However, Rattus rattus Linnaeus was rare, especially at higher elevations, whereas Mus musculus Linnaeus was more abundant at lower elevations.Main conclusions Loxioides are concentrated in habitat that is distributed along a substantial gradient of elevation at least in part because food is available throughout the year and threats to food resources are less concentrated. To recover Loxioides elsewhere in its former range, habitats must be restored and alien threats reduced along extensive elevation gradients. Conservation along environmental gradients will likely benefit other Hawaiian birds that track the availability of food across landscapes or that have been stranded in the higher portions of their original ranges because of the greater impacts of alien diseases, predators, food competitors, and habitat stressors at lower elevations.\"'], ['Use of home ranges by resident bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in a South Carolina estuary,\"By: Gubbins, C\",JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY  Volume: 83   Issue: 1   Pages: 178-187   Published: FEB 2002,\"Abundance, distribution, and ranging patterns of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the western Atlantic Ocean are not well understood.

Originally classified as waste products, these compounds more recently have been investigated extensively by ecologists and pharmacologists, and many complex biological functions have been discovered. Secondary metabolites occur nearly in all living organisms, within bacteria as well as in mammals, and are especially prominent in those organisms lacking an immune system. Functions of plant secondary metabolites comprise attractants, such as color pigments and scents, repellents such as antifeedants against insects and mammals, or toxins that affect growth and development of animal and microbial predators. Conversely, insects can employ plant-synthesized compounds to their own advantage, such as signals for feeding and oviposition and location of prey. Microbes also use secondary metabolites as carbon sources, and bacteria utilize them for quorum-sensing, an aspect recently discovered. Despite the diversity of recognized functions, the biochemical processes underlying these interactions are few. Primarily, they relate to the ability of these small molecules to bind to receptor regions of various proteins such as keys into locks. This review attempts a summary of current knowledge of secondary plant metabolism with focus on history of discovery, development of analytical techniques, theories of origin and function, signal pathways, biosynthesis, and assessment of biological activities. Outlined is current utilization by, and future perspectives in. different disciplines, such as chemo systematics, chemical ecology, and agricultural biotechnology.

Plague epizootics frequently kill  99% of prairie dogs in infected colonies. Although epizootics of sylvatic plague occur throughout most of the range of prairie dogs in the United States and are well described, long-term maintenance of plague in enzootic rodent species is not well documented or understood. We review dynamics of plague in white-tailed (Cynomys leucurus), Gunnison\\'s (C gunnisoni), and black-tailed (C ludovicianus) prairie dogs, and their rodent and flea associates. We use epidemiologic concepts to support an enzootic hypothesis in which the disease is maintained in a dynamic state, which requires transmission of Y. pestis to be slower than recruitment of new susceptible mammal hosts. Major effects of plague are to reduce colony size of black-tailed prairie dogs and increase intercolony distances within colony complexes. In the presence of plague, black-tailed prairie dogs will probably survive in complexes of small colonies that are usually 3 km from their nearest neighbor colonies.\"'], ['Influences of introduced plague on North American mammals: Implications from ecology of plague in Asia,\"By: Biggins, DE; Kosoy, MY\",JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY  Volume: 82   Issue: 4   Pages: 906-916   Published: NOV 2001,\"Intercontinental movements of invasive species continue to modify the world\\'s ecosystems. The plague bacterium (Yersinia pestis) has colonized and altered animal communities worldwide but has received much more attention as a human pathogen. We reviewed studies on the ecology of Y. pestis in ancient foci of central Asia and in western North America, where the bacterium apparently has become established much more recently. Although rodent populations on both continents are affected dramatically by epizootics of plague, the epidemiologically important species of Asia demonstrate resistance in portions of their populations, whereas those of North America are highly susceptible. Individual variation in resistance, which is widespread in Asian rodents and allows a microevolutionary response, has been documented in few North American species of rodents. Plague increases costs of sociality and coloniality in susceptible hosts, increases benefits of disease resistance in general, and increases benefits of adaptability to variable environments for species at higher trophic levels. Prairie dogs (Cynomys) epitomize taxa with high risk to plague because prairie dogs have uniformly low resistance to plague and are highly social. Relationships to plague are poorly understood for many North American rodents, but more than one-half of the species of conservation concern occur within the geographic range of plague.\"'], ['Putting theory into practice: Wildlife health in conservation,\"By: Deem, SL; Karesh, WB; Weisman, W\",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY  Volume: 15   Issue: 5   Pages: 1224-1233   Published: OCT 2001,\"Infectious and noninfectious diseases are being recognized by conservation biologists as an increasing challenge to the conservation of wildlife. Tbe amplified role of diseases as a factor limiting species\\' survival can be traced to anthropogenic changes on a global scale that have direct and indirect influences on the health of wildlife species. These changes include human population growth, habitat fragmentation and degradation, the isolation of populations of species, and an increased proximity of humans (and their domestic animals) to wildlife. Further, some conservation projects have caused more barm than good by unwittingly introducing diseases to wildlife populations, whereas others have failed to meet their objectives because they did not take disease factors into consideration. Conservation biologists need to move quickly past the decades-old debate on the relative importance of wildlife health to conservation and begin using all the tools available to ensure the effectiveness of their efforts. We briefly review the literature on wildlife diseases, place wildlife health in the context of global changes affecting wild animal populations, and offer concrete suggestions for ways to integrate wildlife health sciences into conservation, such as including health assessment or monitoring programs and research on interspecies disease transmission in field biology projects, training wildlife professionals in the design and implementation of wildlife studies that incorporate health components, and encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration. Our goal is to raise awareness that conservation biologists working in disciplines ranging from field biology to policy making have an important role to play in facilitating a transition toward a new conservation paradigm that includes wildlife health. This paradigm shaft will take an academic understanding of the importance of wildlife disease and turn it into practical actions that will help conserve wildlife more effectively.\"'], ['Diseases of humans and their domestic mammals: pathogen characteristics, host range and the risk of emergence,\"By: Cleaveland, S; Laurenson, MK; Taylor, LH\",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES  Volume: 356   Issue: 1411   Pages: 991-999   Published: JUL 29 2001,\"Pathogens that can be transmitted between different host species are of fundamental interest and importance front public health, conservation and economic perspectives yet systematic quantification of these pathogens is lacking.

The database consisted of 1415 pathogens causing disease in humans, 616 in livestock and 374 in domestic carnivores. Multihost pathogens were very prevalent among human pathogens (61.6%) and even more so among domestic mammal pathogens (livestock 77.3%, carnivores 90.0%). Pathogens able to infect human, domestic and wildlife hosts contained a similar proportion of disease-causing pathogens for all three host groups. One hundred and ninety-six pathogens were associated with emerging diseases, 175 in humans, 29 in livestock and 12 in domestic carnivores. Across all these groups, helminths and fungi were relatively unlikely to emerge whereas viruses, particularly RNA viruses, were highly likely to emerge. The ability of a pathogen to infect multiple hosts, particularly hosts in other taxonomic orders or wildlife, were also risk factors for emergence in human and livestock pathogens. There is clearly a need to understand the dynamics of infectious diseases in complex multihost communities in order to mitigate disease threats to public health, livestock economies and wildlife.\"'], ['Climate variability and change in the United States: Potential impacts on vector- and rodent-borne diseases,\"By: Gubler, DJ; Reiter, P; Ebi, KL; et al.\",ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES  Volume: 109   Supplement: 2   Pages: 223-233   Published: MAY 2001,\"Diseases such as plague, typhus, malaria, yellow fever, and dengue fever, transmitted between humans by blood-feeding arthropods, were once common in the United States. Many of these diseases are no longer present, mainly because of changes in land use, agricultural methods, residential patterns, human behavior, and vector control. However, diseases that may be transmitted to humans from wild birds or mammals (zoonoses) continue to circulate in nature in many parts of the country. Most vector-borne diseases exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern, which clearly suggests that they are weather sensitive. Rainfall, temperature, and other weather variables affect in many ways both the vectors and the pathogens they transmit. For example, high temperatures can increase or reduce survival rate, depending on the vector, its behavior, ecology, and many other factors. Thus, the probability of transmission may or may not be increased by higher temperatures. The tremendous growth in international travel increases the risk of importation of vector-borne diseases, some of which can be transmitted locally under suitable circumstances at the right time of the year. But demographic and sociologic factors also play a critical role in determining disease incidence, and it is unlikely that these diseases will cause major epidemics in the United States if the public health infrastructure is maintained and improved.\"'], ['Ilheus arbovirus in wild birds (Sporophila caerulescens and Molothrus bonariensis),\"By: Pereira, LE; Suzuki, A; Lisieux, T; et al.\",REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA  Volume: 35   Issue: 2   Pages: 119-123   Published: APR 2001,\"ObjectiveTo report the first Ilheus arboviruses isolated from wild birds and analyze its public health impact.MethodsWild birds and mammals were captured using mist nets and Tomahawk traps respectively. blood samples were drawn from these animals inoculatedintracerebrally in Swiss suckling mice found in the Parque Ecologico do Tiete, Brazil.

Besides virus isolation, serum samples were also rested for the presence of hemagglutination inhibition antibodies.ResultsTwo strains of Ilheus virus were isolated from the bird species Sporophila caerulescens and Molothrus bonariensis. Specific antibodies to Ilheus virus were detected in serum samples of some birds (Columbina talpacoti, Geopelia cuneata, Sicalis flaveola and Molothrus bonariensis), marmosets (Callithrix jacchus and Callithrix penicillata) and coati (Nasua nasua).ConclusionsVirus isolation and detection of specific antibodies in serum samples of local, migratory and captive birds, captive marmosets and wild c nari corroborate the circulation of Ilheus virus in the Parque Ecologico do Tiete. The migrating behavior of some species of wild birds, like Sporophila caerulescens, enables the virus spread to other regions.

The European badger (Meles meles) and the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) are implicated as significant sources of infection for domestic cattle in the UK and New Zealand respectively. The risk of transmission of infection between a wildlife population and domestic animals will be determined by both the epidemiology of the disease and the ecology of the host. In the UK, surveys by the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) have identified M, bovis infection in deer (Cervus sp., Capreolus sp., Dama sp.), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), mink (Mustela vison), feral ferret (Mustela furo), mole (Talpa europaea), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and feral cat (Felis catus). However, the potential contribution to cattle herd breakdowns, of reservoirs of M, bovis infection in mammals other than the badger is poorly understood and is the subject of current research. In contrast, M, bovis infection in the badger has been the subject of a long term ecological and epidemiological study at Woodchester Park in South-West England, where the prevalence and distribution of infection in a wild population has been intensively monitored. The pattern of infection in the population and potential risks to cattle, are profoundly influenced by badger social organization and behaviour. The pattern of land use and cattle farming practices in the UK brings badgers into close contact with domestic animals and provides conditions that may enhance the likelihood of disease transfer.

Babesia divergens, a parasite of cattle, has been implicated as the most common agent of human babesiosis in Europe, causing severe disease in splenectomized individuals. In the US, Babesia microti, a babesial parasite of small mammals, has been the cause of over 300 cases of human babesiosis since 1969, resulting in mild to severe disease, even in non-splenectomised patients. Changing ecology has contributed greatly to the increase and expansion of human babesiosis in the US. A relatively recently described babesial parasite, the WA1-type, has been shown to be the causative agent in seven human cases in the western US. This parasite is closely related to babesial parasites isolated from large wild ungulates in California. Like B. microti, WA1-type parasites cause mild to severe disease and the immunopathogenesis of these parasites is distinctly different from each other in experimental infections of hamsters and mice. A B. divergens-like parasite was also identified as the cause of a fatal human babesiosis case in Missouri. Isolated cases of human babesisosis have been described in Africa and Mexico, but the causative parasites were not well characterized. Standard diagnostic techniques for human infection, such as examination of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears and serology, have been complemented with molecular techniques, such as PCR. Current treatment for babesiosis is focused on a regimen of clindamycin and quinine, although new drugs have shown promise. Prevention of infection relies on self-monitoring for the presence of ticks and, in some locations, targeted application of pesticides to decrease tick abundance. Identification of human infection with Babesia spp. will probably increase as physicians and the public become more aware of the disease, as people live and recreate in rural tick-infested areas, and as the numbers of immunocompromised individuals increase.

It is now clear that the HIV group of retroviruses came from primates and that the origin of HIV1 is the chimpanzee subspecies of Central Africa, Pan troglodytes troglodytes. Many African primates are natural hosts of retroviruses and details of the natural history of both hosts and viruses are essential to understand the evolution of the latter Data on the demography ecology and behaviour of three species of primates (gorillas, chimpanzees and mandrills), studied in the Lope Reserve in Central Gabon since 1983, are analysed to identify the factors that allow, or favour disease transmission within each species, between different species and between primates and humans. The comparison of the relative degree of risk suggests that of the three species, chimpanzees are the most susceptible to exposure to infection both from conspecifics and from other species. With respect to humans, the comparative analysis suggests greater exposure to viruses of mandrills and gorillas than to those of chimpanzees. For primates, major risk factors are: large social groups; bites inflicted in fights; social grooming; and predation on mammals. However given that contacts between social groups of the same species are rare, the spread of a virus through a population will be slow and uncertain. Hunting wild animals is the behaviour most likely to provide transmission routes for primate viruses into human populations because of the high probability of blood-blood contact. Not only the hunters themselves, but also women who prepare bush meat for cooking and people involved in trade of carcasses are at high risk of transmission of pathogens. Hunting of bush meat is increasing in Central Africa due to the economic recession and the spread of logging into the forests of the interior of the region. To counter the significant risk of transmission of known, as well as new, diseases from primates to humans, urgent measures are needed to attack the root causes of commercial hunting which is not only risk to public health but also a serious threat to biodiversity in the region.\"'], ['The wild hidden face of Lyme borreliosis in Europe,\"By: Humair, PF; Gern, L\",MICROBES AND INFECTION  Volume: 2   Issue: 8   Pages: 915-922   Published: JUL 2000,\"Lyme borreliosis is a zoonosis affecting humans in the Northern hemisphere. The pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu late (sl), persists in endemic areas through a maintenance cycle involving ticks and wild animals. The description of different genospecies associated with Lyme borreliosis in Europe has generated the question concerning the maintenance of these pathogens in nature: how do closely related bacterial species like B. burgdorferi sl circulate between one main tick species, Ixodes ricinus, and several vertebrate host species? Recent studies have provided evidence that specific associations exist in some areas between Borrelia species and vertebrate hosts. The present paper based on this recent knowledge discusses various aspects of the ecology of the disease in Western Europe, in particular the maintenance and dispersal of the pathogens, and brings up some interesting questions.

The impetus for the evaluation of polar bear populations for morbillivirus infections was prompted by epidemics of canine distemper-like disease in seal populations in the north Atlantic regions of Greenland, Europe, and Russia. Since marine morbilliviruses have been further characterized into three major species, phocine distemper virus (PDV), dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) and porpoise morbillivirus (PMV), it was of value to determine the origin of the polar bear infection. One hundred serum samples were selected from a group of sera collected from regions of Alaska and Russia and tested by differential serum neutralization assay against the three major marine morbilliviruses and CDV, to determine the predominant virus infecting the polar bear. Polar bears had higher serum antibody titers to CDV than they did to PDV, DMV, and PMV. These data suggest that polar bears are being infected with a morbillivirus of terrestrial origin. Furthermore, based on the high serum antibody prevalence in the population, the virus may be indigenous to the polar bear and not necessarily the result of interspecies transmission from other arctic mammals susceptible to CDV and/or marine morbilliviruses.\"'], ['Lyme disease,\"By: Gern, L; Falco, RC\",REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE DE L OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES  Volume: 19   Issue: 1   Pages: 121-135   Published: APR 2000,\"Lyme borreliosis, the most common vector-borne disease in the northern hemisphere, is caused by bacteria belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi complex.

We found that H9N2 viruses from North America differ from those of Asia. The North American viruses, which infect primarily domestic turkeys, replicated poorly in inoculated chickens. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein genes indicated that the Asian H9N2 influenza viruses could he divided into three sublineages. Initial biological characterization of at least one virus from each lineage was done in animals. Early isolates of one lineage (A/Chicken/Beijing/1/94, H9N2) caused as high as 80% mortality rates in inoculated chickens, whereas all other strains were nonpathogenic. Sequence analysis showed that some isolates, including the pathogenic isolate, had one additional basic amino acid (A-R/K-S-S-R-) at the hemagglutinin cleavage site. Later isolates of the same lineage (A/Chicken/Hong Kong/G9/97, H9N2) that contains the PB1 and PB2 genes similar to Hong Kong/97 H5N1 viruses replicated in chickens, ducks, mice, and pigs but were pathogenic only in mice. A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (H9N2), from a second lineage that possesses the replicative complex similar to Hong Kong/97 H5N1 virus, replicated in chickens and ducks without producing disease signs, was pathogenic in mice, and spread to the brain without adaptation. Examples of the third Asian H9N2 sublineage (A/Chicken/Korea/323/96, Duck/Hong Kong/Y439/97) replicated in chickens, ducks, and mice without producing disease signs. The available evidence supports the notion of differences in pathogenicity of H9N2 viruses in the different lineages and suggests that viruses possessing genome segments similar to 1997 H5N1-like viruses are potentially pathogenic in mammals.

The relative numbers of nymphal and larval ticks feeding on rodents are crucial variables in determining the probability of rodent infection and the degree of amplification of infection prevalence in the tick population. Manipulation of the microclimate within quasinatural experimental arenas revealed that under increasingly dry conditions the numbers of unfed nymphal Ixodes ricinus L. questing in upper layers of the herbage decreased, whereas the rate of fat use and the numbers of nymphs feeding on small rodents, both increased. This is consistent with nymphs descending to the moist lower vegetation layers for water replenishment, where they would come into contact with small hosts. Very few larvae quested or fed on rodents under the dry conditions, but many more did so once the humidity increased, suggesting that larvae escape desiccation by becoming quiescent. The ratio of larvae to nymphs feeding on rodents thus increases with increasing humidity, contributing to the seasonal and geographical variation in disease transmission dynamics.\"'], ['Review: Marine ecology - Emerging marine diseases - Climate links and anthropogenic factors,\"By: Harvell, CD; Kim, K; Burkholder, JM; et al.\",SCIENCE  Volume: 285   Issue: 5433   Pages: 1505-1510   Published: SEP 3 1999,\"Mass mortalities due to disease outbreaks have recently affected major taxa in the oceans.

These zoonotic viruses circulate in nature either in an Aedes-mammal, Anopheles-mammal, or Culex-bird transmission cycle. Infected humans normally do not contribute to the virus circulation. West Nile virus (Flavivirus) caused an outbreak of fever, malaise, pain in eyes and muscles, and headache and encephalitis in southern France during 1962-1965, and an outbreak of encephalitis with a high case-fatality rate in Romania during 1996. West Nile virus has been isolated from birds, horses, and mosquitoes in Portugal, France, the former Czechoslovakia, and Romania. These data, together with reports of antibodies to West Nile virus in birds, domestic mammals, and humans in several other countries, show virus activity in southern and central Europe. Sindbis virus (Alphavirus) caused outbreaks of fever, rash, and arthralgia in northern Europe during 1981-1982, 1988, and 1995. Two California group viruses (Bunyavirus), Tahyna virus and Inkoo virus, have been identified in western Europe. Tahyna virus causes fever and respiratory symptoms and sometimes also central nervous system involvement. It occurs in most countries of central and southern Europe, and is most common in central Europe. Inkoo virus has not been associated with disease in humans in western Europe although Russian studies indicated that it can cause encephalitis. Inkoo virus occurs in northern Europe, especially in the far north. Batai virus of the Bunyamwera-group (Bunyavirus) occurs in southern, central, and northern Europe, most frequently in central Europe. The antibody prevalence in humans generally is very low, indicating that the potential of this virus as a human pathogen is probably low in Europe. The Lednice virus (Bunyavirus) has been reported only from the former Czechoslovakia and Romania, and apparently is not transmitted to humans. In addition to the six mosquito-borne viruses documented in western Europe, there is serological evidence of infection with a Semliki Forest complex virus (Alphavirus) in central and southern Europe. Although mosquito-borne viruses presently are not considered to be the cause of major health problems in western Europe, the morbidity caused by Sindbis virus, and the morbidity and mortality caused by West Nile virus, merit further studies on the ecology, epidemiology, and medical importance of these viruses. The California group of viruses and a virus of the Semliki Forest complex may be the cause of unrecognized health problems in western Europe. Specific sampling of potential vectors for virus isolation, detailed characterization of virus strains, and the use of fully characterized strains for serological diagnosis will help to elucidate the present and future potential of mosquito-borne viruses as human pathogens in Europe.\"'], ['Incidence from coincidence: patterns of tick infestations on rodents facilitate transmission of tick-borne encephalitis virus,\"By: Randolph, SE; Miklisova, D; Lysy, J; et al.\",PARASITOLOGY  Volume: 118   Pages: 177-186   Part: 2   Published: FEB 1999,\"Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus has a highly focal distribution through Eurasia. Endemic cycles appear to depend on the transmission of non-systemic infections between ticks co-feeding on the same rodent hosts. The particular features of seasonal dynamics and infestation patterns of larval and nymphal Ixodes ricinus, but not Dermacentor reticulatus, from 4 regions within TBE foci in Slovakia, are such as to promote TBE virus transmission. The distributions of larvae and nymphs on their principal rodent hosts are highly aggregated and, rather than being independent, the distributions of each stage are coincident so that the same ca. 20 % of hosts feed about three-quarters of both larvae and nymphs. This results in twice the number of infectible larvae feeding alongside potentially infected nymphs compared with the null hypothesis of independent distributions. Overall, co-feeding transmission under these circumstances brings the reproductive number (R-0) for TBE virus to a level that accounts quantitatively for maintained endemic cycles. Essential for coincident aggregated distributions of larvae and nymphs is their synchronous seasonal activity. Preliminary comparisons support the prediction of a greater degree of coincident seasonality within recorded TBE foci than outside. This identifies the particular climatic factors that permit such patterns of tick seasonal dynamics as the primary predictors for the focal distribution of TBE.\"'], ['Feeding ecology and population dynamics of the feral cat (Felis catus) in relation to the availability of prey in central-eastern New South Wales,\"By: Molsher, R; Newsome, A; Dickman, C\",WILDLIFE RESEARCH  Volume: 26   Issue: 5   Pages: 593-607   Published: 1999,\"The diet of feral cats (Felis catus) was studied at Lake Burrendong, central-eastern New South Wales, from July 1994 to June 1997.

Grey and red squirrels, hedgehogs as well as hares and rabbits can develop an infection and transmit B. burgdorferi sensu late to feeding ticks.In Eurasian endemic areas, many different Borrelia species circulate between ticks and vertebrate hosts. Studies have shown that European and Asian genospecies are associated with specific groups of vertebrate hosts, such as B. valaisiana and B. garinii with birds, B. afzelii with small mammals and B. burgdorferi ss and B. afzelii with red squirrels.

Many groups of wild vertebrates (birds and mammals) act as usual reservoirs for arboviruses. Domestic or commensal mammals as well as human beings, are rarely involved as reservoirs.Invertebrate reservoirs: arthropods are involved in the maintenance of many arboviruses for two main reasons: their longevity and the possibility of vertical transmission of the virus. An infected arthropod remains infected throughout its life, in spite of successive moultings. This lifetime can be long, especially for ticks. Vertical transmission is known in some virus-vector systems, but its frequency appears to be very variable. The epidemiological importance of the phenomenon is specially high in the case of cold- resistant or dry-resistant eggs.These facts lead to a large variety of epidemiological situations according to virus and region. Studying epidemiological situations also shows up the evolution of these systems, as a response to environmental modifications, often resulting from human activities.Furthermore, the repeated passages of an arbovirus in reservoir hosts could induce modifications of the viral genome, for example by facilitating the emergence of reassortants during coinfections. Finally for many different reasons, it seems difficult, for the moment, to imagine efficient preventive measures levelled at any kind of natural reservoirs.\"'], ['Ecologic studies of rodent reservoirs: Their relevance for human health,\"By: Mills, JN; Childs, JE\",EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES  Volume: 4   Issue: 4   Pages: 529-537   Published: OCT-DEC 1998,\"Within the past few years, the number of \"\"new\"\" human diseases associated with small-mammal reservoirs has increased dramatically, stimulating renewed interest in reservoir ecology research.

These ticks, which occur throughout the northern temperate zone, have very similar life cycles and ecological requirements. All are three-host ticks, with the immature stages mainly parasitizing small to medium-sized mammals and birds and the adult females parasitizing large mammals such as deer, cattle, sheep and hares. The host-seeking stages show a distinct seasonality, which is regulated by diapause mechanisms and there appear to be major differences in this respect between the Old World and New World species. Most cases of human borreliosis are transmitted in the summer by the nymphal stages, with the exception of the Eurasian species, I. persulcatus, in which the adult females are mainly responsible. The ticks acquire the spirochaetes from a wide variety of mammals and birds but large mammals do not seem to be infective, so that ticks that feed almost exclusively on large mammals, for example in some agricultural habitats, are rarely infected. The greatest tick infection prevalences occur in deciduous woodland harbouring a diverse mix of host species and the diversity of the different genospecies of B. burgdorferi s.l. is also greatest in such habitats. There is evidence that these genospecies have different host predilections but, apart from the fact that I. persulcatus does not seem to be infected by B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, they do not seem to be adapted to different tick strains or species.

Mammals were collected monthly from September through to April. Following tick removal, the animals were tested for B. burgdorferi by culture of ear-punch biopsies. Larvae and nymphs that were intermediate in morphology between Ixodes spinipalpis and Ixodes neotomae occurred on several species of rodents (Peromyscus truei, Peromyscus californicus, Microtus californicus, Rattus rattus and Reithrodontomys megalotis) and the brush rabbit (Sylvilagus bachmani). Morphometric analyses of these I. spinipalpis-like ticks and the offspring from two I. neotomae females from this site suggest that I. neotomae may be conspecific with I. spinipalpis. Borrelia burgdorferi was isolated from eight out of 109 (7.3%), three out of 16 (18.8%), two out of 38 (5.3%) and two out of six (33.3%) P. truei, P. maniculatus, M. californicus and R. rattus, respectively. One brush rabbit yielded the first isolate of B. burgdorferi from a lagomorph in western North America. This isolate and three others derived from unfed I. spinipalpis-like nymphs failed to produce infection when inoculated intradermally into 11-12 P. maniculatus each. Likewise, no spirochetes were detected in 420 Ixodes pacificus nymphs derived from larvae fed on animals inoculated with these isolates. An additional isolate, derived from an I. spinipalpis-like nymph, was recovered by ear-punch biopsies from five out of 12 (42%) needle-inoculated P. maniculatus. However, spirochetes were not detected in 20 I. pacificus nymphs fed as larvae on each of five mice (two infected and three uninfected) inoculated with this isolate. We conclude that brush rabbits and several species of rodents besides woodrats may contribute to the maintenance of B. burgdorferi because they harbour the spirochete and are fed upon by competent enzootic and bridge vectors.\"'], ['The primate community of the Lope Reserve, Gabon: Diets, responses to fruit scarcity, and effects on biomass,\"By: Tutin, CEG; Ham, RM; White, LJT; et al.\",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY  Volume: 42   Issue: 1   Pages: 1-24   Published: 1997,\"The diets of all diurnal primates (Gorilla g. gorilla, Pan t. troglodytes, Mandrillus sphinx Colobus satanas, Cercocebus albigena, Cercopithecus nictitans, C. pogonias, C. cephus) in the Lope Reserve, central Gabon, are described from qualitative and quantitative data collected over 10 years. A total of 397 foods were recorded, of which 91% were from plants. The diets of seven of the eight species were numerically dominated by fruit, the exception being Colobus satanas with a diet dominated by seeds. When proportion of feeding time was examined, fruit remained the dominant food class for six species, while Cercocebus albigena, like the black colobus, spent most time feeding on seeds. The number of foods recorded per species ranged from 46-220, but dietary breadth of the four species that have not been subjects of detailed study was certainly underestimated. Almost half of the foods (46%) were eaten by only one species, and only four (1%) were recorded for all eight species. At Lope, fruit is scarce for 2-3 months during the annual dry season, and fruit crop failures can prolong this period of scarcity to as many as 8 months in some years. When fruit is scarce, the diets of all species changed to include more nonfruit foods, but chimpanzees and the three species of guenons maintained a fruit dominated diet. The total biomass of the Lope primate community is 374 kg/km(2), which is low compared to other sites in tropical Africa. Within the Lope community, biomass correlates negatively with degree of frugivory, suggesting that fruit availability may be critical, but this does not explain the low total biomass compared to other sites. Neither floristic diversity nor the composition of the primate community at Lope can account for the low biomass. While historical events such as climate-induced changes in forest cover, disease, or impact of human activities cannot be ruled out, we conclude that the most likely explanation of low primate biomass is the occurrence of an ecological \\'\\'catastrophe\\'\\' in the fairly recent past from which populations have not yet recovered. We believe that the most likely scenario was climate-mediated disturbance of flowering of important fruit food species. Prolonged fruit scarcity would have caused mortalities and affected the most frugivorous species more severely.

Most introductions were deliberate and the deleterious effects became apparent later. These pests affect primary production, act as a sylvatic reservoir of disease, cause degradation of natural ecosystems, or threaten rare or endangered native animals and plants. Many species have multiple impacts. In Australia, some native mammals, particularly kangaroos and wallabies, are also controlled because of their adverse impacts on primary production.In both countries, current control depends largely on the use of poisons, shooting, the spread of disease (in the case of rabbits), trapping, habitat alteration, and commercial or recreational hunting. Methods of control by interfering with fertility (immunocontraception) are currently being investigated for rabbits, house mice, foxes, and kangaroos in Australia, and for the brushtail possum in New Zealand. If these methods prove effective, they may be applied to other mammal pests, but the need to tailor the particular approach to the ecology and behaviour of the species means that there will be a necessarily long lead time.\"'], ['Interspecific differences between small mammals as hosts of immature Dermacentor variabilis (Acari: Ixodidae) and a model for detection of high risk areas of Rocky Mountain spotted fever,\"By: Kollars, TM\",JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY  Volume: 82   Issue: 5   Pages: 707-710   Published: OCT 1996,\"Fourteen species of small mammals were captured from July 1990 through August 1991 in Tennessee, from which 1,217 immature Dermacentor variabilis and 1 Ixodes dentatus were collected. Mammal species were given scores of importance (TS) as hosts to immature D. variabilis based on mean intensity and prevalence. The rice rat ranked the highest, with a TS = 5, followed by the golden mouse TS = 4, white-footed mouse TS = 3, pine vole TS = 2, cotton rat TS = 1, with the Norway rat, house mouse, and short-tailed shrew all having a TS = 0. Assigning a TS allows a quantitative method for differentiating and ranking small mammals as hosts for immature D. variabilis. Relative abundance of a species can also be important in determining D. variabilis populations, even with a low TS. The potential of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSFP) to occur in an area was estimated using the total score of small mammal hosts in an area and multiplying the relative abundance of important host species. The RMSFP of a site, based only upon small mammal species composition and relative abundance of important host species, was an accurate estimate of adult D. variabilis infesting raccoons and opossums at that trap site (P less than or equal to 0.001).

Five cases illustrate discontinuities and synergisms and how system changes may take place. For Caribbean coral reefs, the result of overfishing and disease has been a \\'shrinkage\\' in the entire system, the effects of which may cascade through the coastal seascape. For Beringia, patterns of benthic diversity are best understood in a manner that matches the multiscale, integrated dynamics of weather, ice, marine mammal feeding, and community structure. In the case of US East Coast estuaries, oyster reefs may be keystone elements, with important effects on functional diversity. Large-scale coastal systems depend upon the connectivity of fresh and marine waters in the coastal zone, having implications for the apparent stochasticity of coastal fisheries. And, for a coastal barrier-lagoon site, a state change may be described in terms of a combination of succession, the attainment of a quasi-equilibrium state, and disturbance. A profound problem for conservation is that there is very little information about the relationship between species diversity and ecological function.

West of the Pecos River in the American Southwest, present-day abundances and distributional ranges of bison and American elk exceed those reported in early historic times. I evaluate several potential causes for the historic scarcity of these animals-inadequate forage, insufficient water, nonhuman predation, disease, and hunting by late-prehistoric humans. Archaeological and ecological evidence suggest that restricted availability of water coupled with hunting by late-prehistoric peoples probably were the most important causes. Perennial water is more widely distributed now than previously, mainly because of water well and water catchment construction. Proliferation of agriculture-based human economies in the region from AD 0-1500 led to rapid population growth of aboriginal peoples, with resulting increased harvests of resources. The likelihood that late-prehistoric humans severely depleted the abundances of large mammals indicates a need to reevaluate the exclusive use of early-historic conditions as the basis for setting goals for ecosystem management. Implications of reintroducing large herbivores to ecosystems are discussed.\"'], ['Temporal and spatial dynamics of Ixodes scapularis (Acari: Ixodidae) in a rural landscape,\"By: Ostfeld, RS; Hazler, KR; Cepeda, OM\",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY  Volume: 33   Issue: 1   Pages: 90-95   Published: JAN 1996,\"We studied seasonal, interannual, and both small- and large-scale spatial variation in the abundance of blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis Say, in a semirural landscape in southeastern New York. Using transect drag sampling, we found that ticks were approximately twice as abundant in 1994 as in the preceding 2 yr. In 1994, larval ticks showed a strong peak in activity in late spring, coincident with the nymphal peak that year. All post-egg life stages were more abundant in forested than in shrubby or herbaceous habitat types, but peak abundance of larvae shifted from oak-dominated forest in 1992 to maple-dominated forest in 1993 and 1994. All life stages were highly clumped at small spatial scales, but larvae were the most aggregated. Within the forested habitat types, we observed an initial increase followed by a decrease in small-scale clumping during seasonal activity for each life stage. We discuss potential effects of the observed temporal and spatial variation on risk of Lyme disease. Because of pronounced variation in abundance and activity patterns among years and habitat types, we caution against generalizing from short-term or spatially limited studies.\"'], ['Influence of fragmentation and disturbance on the potential impact of feral predators on native fauna in Australian forest ecosystems,\"By: May, SA; Norton, TW\",WILDLIFE RESEARCH  Volume: 23   Issue: 4   Pages: 387-400   Published: 1996,\"We review current knowledge of the diet and predator-prey relationships of the feral cat (Felis catus), fox (Vulpes vulpes) and dingo (Canis familiaris dingo) (including wild dogs), and consider how forest fragmentation by roads may influence the use of native forest ecosystems by these species and the significance of this for native fauna. The cat, fox and dingo are significant predators in Australia that interact with native fauna in various ways, including predation, competition for resources, and transmission of disease. On the basis of current knowledge, it is clear that the nature and impact of predation by the cat, fox and dingo on native fauna are primarily determined by prey availability, although there are exceptions to this rule. Generally, dingoes prey upon large to medium-sized prey species (e.g. wallabies, common wombats and possums), foxes prey upon medium-sized to small prey (e.g. possums and rats) and consume a significant component of scavenged material and vegetation, while cats also prey upon medium-sized to small prey, but may have a greater proportion of reptiles and birds in their diet. The cat is generally considered to be an opportunistic predator and to have contributed to the demise of a number of mammals. The fox is considered more of a threat to small native mammals than is the cat and it has been asserted that all species of mammals that fall within the critical weight range (CWR) of 120-5000 g are at risk of local extinction when the fox is present. The severity of the impact of the dingo upon the native fauna is considered to be minimal, at least in comparison with the impact that the cat and fox can have on populations. The dingo is not considered a threat to CWR mammals in undisturbed environments. The fox, feral cat and dingo are all considered to have the ability to selectively prey upon species and, to some extent, individual sexes and age-classes of a number of larger prey species.Although many of Australia\\'s forested areas are relatively heavily fragmented by roads, there are no published studies specifically investigating the use of roads by feral predators. Information on the distribution and abundance of foxes, cats and dingoes in these ecosystems, their ecology and their impact on native fauna is particularly limited. Further, the extent to which roads influence the distribution and abundance of these species and the consequences of these for native fauna are poorly known. Given this, we suggest that one of the most important research needs is to establish the relative impact that exotic predators may have on native fauna under varying degrees of road construction within native forests. For example, are areas with and without roads in forests used differently by exotic predators and what is the significance of this in terms of the potential impact on fauna? The extent to which feral predators forage away from roads needs further investigation, as does the rates of predation within edges, because this may have several consequences for the design, location and size of retained strips and wildlife corridors as well as restoration programmes. Further observations on regional differences influencing predator-prey interactions are required, as is research on the potential impacts on native fauna resulting from prey selection in forests subjected to various degrees of fragmentation and modification.\"'], ['CONTROLLING LYME-DISEASE BY MODIFYING THE DENSITY AND SPECIES COMPOSITION OF TICK HOSTS,\"By: VANBUSKIRK, J; OSTFELD, RS\",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS  Volume: 5   Issue: 4   Pages: 1133-1140   Published: NOV 1995,\"We used computer simulation of Lyme disease to test the hypothesis that infection rates of ticks and risk to humans could be reduced by controlling populations of the vertebrate hosts of vector ticks. The model was patterned after the life cycle of the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis). Annual survival and fecundity were dependent on the availability of hosts. The likelihood of ticks becoming infected depended on the reservoir competence of hosts and the previous exposure of hosts to infected ticks. Our results demonstrated that the density of ticks was more sensitive to the availability of hosts for juveniles than hosts for adults, suggesting that control of Lyme disease by reducing host densities would prove difficult, since the numerous alternative hosts for juvenile ticks are not amenable to control. The infection rate of ticks depended critically on the reservoir competence of host species parasitized by juveniles. We conclude that measures that alter the species composition of small mammals and birds, and hence modify the average reservoir competence of hosts for juveniles, could be used to manipulate the risk of Lyme disease without actually changing the density of ticks.\"'], ['INFESTATION OF RODENTS WITH LARVAL IXODES-RICINUS (ACARI, IXODIDAE) IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE TRANSMISSION CYCLE OF BORRELIA-BURGDORFERI SL IN GERMAN WOODLANDS,\"By: KURTENBACH, K; KAMPEN, H; DIZIJ, A; et al.\",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY  Volume: 32   Issue: 6   Pages: 807-817   Published: NOV 1995,\"The ecology of Borrelia burgdorferi Johnson et al. s.l. was investigated from 1987 to 1993 in a preserved woodland in western Germany near Bonn. In selected biotopes, host-seeking Ixodes ricinus L. were regularly collected by blanket dragging in 1987, 1988, and 1989 and screened for infection with B. burgdorferi. Rodents were trapped monthly between April and October in 1988, 1990, 1991, and in the winter of 1992-1993, examined for antibodies to B. burgdorferi s.l., and inspected for feeding ticks. Ticks collected from rodents were screened for spirochete infection. High numbers of host-seeking nymphs were consistently collected within a biotope characterized by humid and acid soils. The mean number of ticks was significantly lower in biotopes with permeable soils. All small mammals captured belonged to the species Apodemus flavicollis Melchior, A. sylvaticus L., and Clethrionomys glareolus Schreber. Of 11,680 ticks obtained from rodents, 11,674 were l. ricinus, with 97.9% of the ticks being larvae, 2.0% nymphs, and 0.1% females. Mean numbers of feeding ticks ranged from 3.4 to 117 larvae per rodent and from 0.0 to 0.64 nymph per rodent, respectively. High levels of larval infestation on rodents were recorded in the same biotope where high numbers of host-seeking nymphs were present. Members of the genus Apodemus were more heavily infested with I. ricinus larvae than C. glareolus. The mean infection prevalence in host-seeking ticks was found to be 1% for larvae, 5% for nymphs, and 10-20% for adults. The infection prevalence in host-seeking nymphs ranged from 1.1 to 15.4% according to the particular biotope. The values for specific infectivity for the Apodemus populations were positively correlated with the mean larval infestation, but not with nymphal infestation. The respective estimates for C. glareolus were much higher than those for Apodemus spp. in biotopes with low tick densities. However specific infectivity of C. glareolus was substantially reduced at sites with high tick abundances. In biotopes with high numbers of infected I. ricinus, significantly more rodents were found to have antibodies to B. burgdorferi than in biotopes with low abundances of ticks. The data show that C. glareolus plays a different role as reservoir host species compared with the 2 Apodemus species. This and previous studies suggest that the degree of infestation with larval I. ricinus differentially modulates infectivity of host species for ticks. We conclude that immune processes in natural reservoir hosts induced by B. burgdorferi or I. ricinus bites (or both) are important regulatory factors in the transmission cycle(s) of B. burgdorferi.\"'], ['IXODES-SCAPULARIS (ACARI, IXODIDAE) AT THE EDGE OF ITS RANGE IN SOUTHERN WISCONSIN,\"By: FRENCH, JB\",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY  Volume: 32   Issue: 6   Pages: 876-881   Published: NOV 1995,\"This study examined the density and distribution of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say, at the edge of its range in southern Wisconsin in 1988 and 1989.

Risk of exposure to Lyme disease is a function of the abundance of ticks (Ixodes scapularis, formerly I. dammini), which in turn may be determined by the distribution of key vertebrate hosts within landscapes. We used transect drag sampling and small-mammal trapping to estimate, respectively, the abundance of host-seeking and attached ticks in a rural landscape (southeastern New York) consisting of a mosaic of several discrete habitat types. Forested habitat types supported higher densities of host-seeking ticks than herbaceous or shrub-dominated habitats. However, in patches of little bluestem grass and gray dogwood shrubs, small mammals had high tick burdens despite low densities of host-seeking ticks. There was an outbreak of larval ticks limited to oak-dominated habitats in summer, 1999, which we postulate was related to unusually heavy acorn (mast) production attracting white-tailed deer and attached adult deer ticks, in autumn 1991. This hypothesis was supported by low densities of larval ticks in oak patches in summer, 1993, following poor mast production the previous autumn. Instead, the 1993 larval peak shifted to maple-dominated habitats, which may result from intensive use of these patches by deer in nonmast years. The abundance of host-seeking nymphs was strongly correlated with the abundance of whitefooted mice the prior summer. Both the high tick burdens in little bluestem and dogwood patches, and shifting locations of larval outbreaks, appear to be functions of landscape configuration, especially patch size and juxtaposition.\"'], ['The unnatural history of the Monterey pine,\"By: Clapp, RA\",GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW  Volume: 85   Issue: 1   Pages: 1-19   Published: JAN 1995,\"Once a relict species, the Monterey pine is now the preeminent timber tree of maritime temperate lands.

The involvement of disease and immunocompetence in the regulation of small mammal populations is not well understood but a strong relationship between physiological stress and immunity has been demonstrated. Its involvement is further supported by several studies, which have provided evidence that survival, incidence of disease, and selected gross measures of immunity change temporally with density and season. We examined this hypothesis by documenting the existence of temporal alterations in selected measures of both humoral and cell-mediated immune function in a population of cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus), a species known to fluctuate widely in density, inhabiting a tallgrass prairie in central Oklahoma. A total of 310 cotton rats was collected from August 1989 to May 1991 (10 collections) using conventional live-trap methods. In addition to morphological characteristics of primary and secondary lymphoid organs, the ability of splenocytes to produce specific antibody in response to a single injection of sheep erythrocytes and to proliferate in response to in vitro exposure to mitogens was measured to assess immunocompetence. Whole blood was collected for the determination of total peripheral blood leukocyte counts, packed cell volume, and total serum proteins. Statistically significant differences in all variables except total serum protein existed among the 10 collections and most of this variability was independent of specific seasonal time periods. Bimodal rhythmicity was characteristic of temporal changes for several measures of immunocompetence. Changes over time in the average immunocompetence of this population could have reflected a shift in genotypic polymorphism; several other plausible explanations are offered to explain the observed temporal patterns.\"'], ['RABIES AND WILDLIFE - A CONSERVATION PROBLEM,\"By: MACDONALD, DW\",ONDERSTEPOORT JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH  Volume: 60   Issue: 4   Pages: 351-355   Published: DEC 1993,\"Understanding the behavioural ecology of wild mammals in rabies epizootics is a prerequisite to scientifically sound management of the disease.

Earlier studies have suggested that these key structuring processes establish a small number of dominant temporal frequencies that entrain other processes. These frequencies often differ from each other by at least an order of magnitude. If true. ecosystems therefore will have a few dominant frequencies that are endogenously driven and that are discontinuously distributed.This paper additionally tests the proposition that these structuring processes should also generate a discontinuous distribution of spatial structures coupled with the discontinuous frequencies. If that is the case, animals living in specific landscapes should demonstrate the existence of this lumpy architecture by showing gaps in the distribution of their sizes. This proved to be the case for birds and mammals of the boreal region forest and the short-grass prairie. Alternative hypotheses to explain the body mass clumps include architectural, developmental, historical, and trophic causes. These were all tested by comparing body-mass clump distributions (1) in ecosystems having different spatial structures (forest, grassland, and marine pelagic) and (2) in different animal groups having different body plans (birds and mammals) or feeding habits (carnivore, omnivore, and herbivore). The only hypothesis that could not be rejected is that the body-mass clumps are entrained by discontinuous hierarchical structures and textures of the landscape. There is evidence for at least eight distinct habitat \"\"quanta,\"\" each defined by a distinct texture at a specific range of scales. These eight quanta together cover tens of centimetres to hundreds of kilometres in space and at least months to millennia in time.There is a striking similarity, but not identity, between the clump structure of prairie and boreal animals. This indicates that many processes that form qualitative habitat structure are common to both landscapes or ecosystems, but a few are landscape specific, particularly over larger scales. That conclusion is extended to all terrestrial ecosystems by an analysis of the body-mass clump structure of all North American birds.In contrast, there are striking differences in clump structure between landscapes and \"\"waterscapes,\"\" indicating that fundamentally different processes shape structure in terrestrial and open ocean systems.The discontinuous body-mass structure provides a bioassay of discontinuous ecosystem structure. Mammalian carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores all show the same number of body-mass clumps, and the gaps in these distributions occur al the same body masses. Mammals and birds show the same number of body-mass clumps, but the mass gaps for mammals occur at larger sizes than those for birds in such a way that the log-transformed body-mass gaps for mammals are correlated linearly with those for birds. Hence there is a simple cross-calibration between the mammal and bird bioassays.I compiled and analyzed published data on home ranges in order to convert body masses into an absolute linear measure of geometric structures in the landscape. A new and general equation was developed relating home-range size to body mass, and was tested by reanalyzing published data for mammalian carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores and for birds. I conclude: (1) Birds and mammals of all trophic levels utilize resources in their foraging areas in the same way by measuring the spatial grain of habitat patches with a resolution defined as a function of their size (i.e., the animal\\'s step length or minimum unit of measurement). The step length is a morphological function of the size of animals and is not significantly affected by trophic status or taxonomy of the groups considered. That explains why all trophic levels and both birds and mammals show the same qualitative body-mass clump structure. (2) Home-range data can convert the body-mass data to a quantitative estimate of texture, i.e., of fractal dimension of the landscape.The landscape forms a hierarchy that contains breaks in object sizes, object proximities, and textures at particular scales. Animals also demonstrate a hierarchy of decisions whose target suddenly shifts at specific scales in space and time. The interaction between these two hierarchies produces the discontinuous body-mass clump structure. The breaks in geometry in the landscape occur because structuring processes exert their influence over defined ranges of scale. The temporal and architectural structure of habitat quanta are in general determined by three classes of processes, each dominating over three different ranges of scale. Vegetative processes that determine plant growth, plant form, and soil structure dominate the formation of texture at fine microscales of centimetres to tens of metres in space and days to decades in time. At the other, macroscale extreme, slow geomorphological processes dominate the formation of a topographic and edaphic structure at large scales of hundreds to thousands of kilometres and centuries to millennia. At the mesoscales in between, contagious disturbance processes such as fire, insect outbreak, plant disease, and water flow dominate the formation of patterns over spatial scales of hundreds of metres to hundreds of kilometres. In addition, the direct impacts of grazing by large herbivores and of human activities, and the indirect effects of large predators and animal disease, further transform spatial patterns over these meso-scales. These processes operate on time scales of years to decades, making them critically important in determining whether present local, regional, and global human influences will trigger a transition in vegetation types, and, if so, how rapidly.The paper provides a direction for the development of programs to evaluate, monitor, and predict ecosystem and community changes across scales. The necessary research elements include (1) models that incorporate a few scale-dependent structuring processes to allow cross-scale analysis; (2) comparative studies of different disturbed and undisturbed landscapes using the animal body-mass bioassay technique to identify critical scales of ecosystem geometry; (3) analysis of remote imagery to identify spatial discontinuities and regions of scale invariance; and (4) behavioral studies of the hierarchy of animal decisions to identify species groups vulnerable to predicted (using models) or observed (using remote imagery) changes in vegetation geometry.\"'], ['EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF TICK-BORNE ENCEPHALITIS IN THE EASTERN PART OF GERMANY BETWEEN 1960 AND 1990 AND STUDIES ON THE DYNAMICS OF A NATURAL FOCUS OF TICK-BORNE ENCEPHALITIS,\"By: SUSS, J; SINNECKER, H; SINNECKER, R; et al.\",ZENTRALBLATT FUR BAKTERIOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY VIROLOGY PARASITOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES  Volume: 277   Issue: 2   Pages: 224-235   Published: JUL 1992,\"From 1960 to 1990, attempts to isolate TBE virus from ticks, and small mammals were made and investigations to detect TBE antibody in small mammals, game and humans were performed in the five new federal Lander of Germany. The confirmed TBE cases for which the site of exposure could be determined were also registered. As a result of these epidemiological and ecological investigations, a map is presented showing the natural foci of TBE which are primarily located in the subatlantic and mountainous climatic regions. TBE was endemic in the area of investigation from 1960 to 1990 showing a morbidity of up to 0.7 per 100 000 inhabitants which decreased in recent years to 0.02 per 100 000 inhabitants. The natural foci of TBE virus in eastern Germany showed a high activity between 1960 and 1970. Since that time, there have hardly been any cases of human disease and TBE virus could no longer be detected, neither in ticks nor in small mammals. Taking the natural focus on the Island of Usedom as an example, attempts have been made to elucidate whether such foci have become extinct or whether they have persisted. From 1983 to 1989, a surveillance programme was performed to detect antibodies to TBE virus in small mammals and game and to attempt to culture virus from ticks and small mammals. The attempts to isolate virus from a total of 8200 ticks were negative. Attempts to isolate virus from the brains of small mammals were also negative. Antibody prevalence in 446 small mammals and 500 animals of game was ca. 1 %. At one site, the sero-positive reactions converted from 0 % (1983-1988) to 4.5 % (1989) among small mammals population. The investigations performed on the Island of Usedom have shown that this natural focus has not disappeared but is in a state of endemic latency. Moreover, the seroconversion observed in the small mammals population shows that further surveillance of such foci is necessary. This becomes obvious by the sporadic occurrence of single TBE cases as well as by a low antibody prevalence of 1 % in small mammals and game. The epidemiological situation in eastern Germany is thus completely different from that in western Germany where an average of 70-120 TBE cases per year are registered, occurring mainly in Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg.\"'], ['RATES OF BORRELIA-BURGDORFERI INFECTION IN IXODES-DAMMINI (ACARI, IXODIDAE) IN SOUTHWESTERN WISCONSIN,\"By: SHARON, MD; ROWLEY, WA; NOVAK, MG; et al.\",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY  Volume: 29   Issue: 2   Pages: 314-317   Published: MAR 1992,\"Ixodes dammini Spielman, Clifford, Piesman & Corwin collected from a study site in southwestern Wisconsin were examined for Borrelia burgdorferi infection.
