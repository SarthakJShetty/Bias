Selection to maintain darker skin in high UVR environments is expected to constrain pigmentation phenotype and variation in pigmentation loci. Consistent with this hypothesis, the gene MC1R exhibits reduced diversity in African populations from high UVR regions compared to low-UVR non-African populations. However, MC1R diversity in non-African populations that have evolved under high-UVR conditions is not well characterized. '\"], [\"'The Cicadoidea fauna of Wallacea, New Guinea and Melanesia is in great majority of Oriental origin, but shows high endemism at the generic and specific levels. In general the patterns of distribution of cicadas in this eastern archipelagic part of the Oriental region quite closely reflect the changing positions of land in past ages, perhaps more distinctly than in many other groups of insects because cicadas are less dispersive.'\"], [\"'The anthropogenic plutonium isotopes are important geochemical tracers for environmental studies. The distributions and sources of the Pu isotopes in water column or sediments of the North Pacific have been intensively studied. However, knowledge on the distribution of Pu isotopes in sediments of the Central Pacific, when available, is limited. To study the composition of Pu isotopes in the ocean, thus to identify the sources of radioactive pollution, sediment core samples were collected in the Central Pacific by R/V Hakuho Maru in the KH-04-5 cruise. The activity concentrations of 239+240Pu and the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio were determined using a sector-field inductively coupled mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS) combined with a high efficiency sample introduction system (APEX-Q). Possible sources and sedimentation behavior of Pu isotopes are discussed.'\"], [\"'The Malayo-Oceanic tropics have long been regarded as a center for plant domestication, but archaeology has as yet contributed little direct evidence of the processes of domestication in prehistory. Recent excavations of Lapita culture sites in the Mussau Islands dating to 1600\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93500 B.C. have yielded the first significant assemblage of preserved seeds and other floral remains representing 20+ taxa. Nearly all of these are tree crops of widespread importance in Malayo-Oceanic cultivation systems. These materials confirm that the Lapita culture, responsible for the initial human settlement of much of the southwestern Pacific, included developed arboriculture in its economic system.'\"], [\"'We conducted 1-year-long mooring observations four times below 2000\\\\xc2\\\\xa0m, slightly south of the equator (2\\\\xc2\\\\xb039\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xb2 to 4\\\\xc2\\\\xb035\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xb2S) at 162\\\\xc2\\\\xb0E in the Melanesian Basin in order to detect the southward deep western boundary return current crossing the equator. Contrary to our initial expectation of the deep flow scheme in the equatorial western boundary region, the observed results indicated a fairly complicated flow configuration. We analyzed the results with the help of a high-resolution model simulation. The ensemble average of the horizontal flow at each level near the deep western boundary indicates a significant westward flow at 2000 and 2250\\\\xc2\\\\xa0m, with an insignificant southward component at 2500 and 2750\\\\xc2\\\\xa0m. The annual mean meridional transports are very small (>1\\\\xc2\\\\xa0Sv) and insignificant, with an ensemble-averaged value of 0.3\\\\xc2\\\\xa0Sv (southward) \\\\xc2\\\\xb10.4\\\\xc2\\\\xa0Sv at most. Combining this with high-resolution model results, it is deduced that the southward transport of the deep western boundary current (DWBC) leaving the equator may be smaller than those obtained by low-resolution models, because of trapping of its fairly large fraction in the equatorial zone. Annual-scale flow patterns are classified into several categories, mainly based on the meridional-flow dominating or the zonal-flow dominating pattern. A case of the meridional-flow dominating patterns may possibly capture an annual-scale variability of DWBC, because its meridional transport variation, though somewhat weak, is consistent with that simulated. The zonal-flow dominating regime includes two types: long-lasting, almost steady westward flows and long-term zonal flow oscillations. The former seems to comprise well-known zonally elongated and meridionally narrow structures of the zonal flow beneath the thermocline in the equatorial region. The ensemble-averaged flow mentioned above is dominated by this type at the upper two levels 2000 and 2250\\\\xc2\\\\xa0m, with total westward transport of 1.6\\\\xc2\\\\xa0\\\\xc2\\\\xb1\\\\xc2\\\\xa00.7\\\\xc2\\\\xa0Sv. The latter type seems to be a manifestation of the vertically propagating equatorial annual Rossby waves.'\"], [\"'Laboratory and field investigations were carried out to investigate the nature and role of the male pheromone emitted by the Dynast beetle Scapanes australis and to develop a mass trapping technique against this major coconut pest in Papua New Guinea. We report the biological data obtained from natural and synthetic pheromone, previously described as an 84:12:4 (w/w) mixture of 2-butanol (1), 3-hydoxy-2-butanone (2), and 2,3-butanediol (3). EAG recordings from natural and synthetic pheromone and a pitfall olfactometer were poorly informative. In contrast, extensive field trapping trials with various synthetic pheromone mixtures and doses showed that 1 and 2 (formulated in polyethylene sachets in 90:5 v:v ratio) were necessary and sufficient for optimum long-range attraction. Beetles were captured in traps baited with racemic 1 plus 2, with or without a stereoisomer mixture of 3 (2.5- to 2500-mg/day doses). Plant pieces, either sugarcane or coconut, enhanced captures by the synthetic pheromone, which was active alone. Traps with the pheromone caught both sexes in a 3:2 female\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93male ratio. A pheromone-based mass trapping led to the capture of 2173 beetles in 14 traps surrounding 40 ha of a cocoa-coconut plantation. The captures followed a log-linear decrease during the 125-week trapping program. The role of the male pheromone and its potential for crop protection are discussed.'\"], [\"'It is the contention of this paper that some progress in alleviating the social and environmental problems which are beginning to face Papua New Guinea can be achieved by supporting traditional Melanesian values through maintaining the customary system of communal land tenure. In accordance with this aim, I will proceed to contrast certain Western attitudes towards \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cindividual freedom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cselfinterested behaviour\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cindividual and communal interests\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cprivate ownership\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d with attitudes and values expressed in the traditional Melanesian approach. In order to demonstrate the latter, I will briefly touch upon the phenomenon of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwantokism\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and indicate how the Melanesian values associated with this concept find their locus in the system of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ccustomary communal ownership\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d. Subsequently, I will describe how the emergence of a cash economy and the attachment to Western gadgetry and products have effected injury to the environment and undermined values which have previously maintained Melanesian social cohesion. While admitting that little can be done to eradicate the desire for cash and the products it can buy, I suggest that Melanesian communities and the environment itself would receive more protection if future development in Papua New Guinea embraced a system which incorporated certain of the traditional Melanesian values through the preservation of the communal form of land tenure. Ultimately, I suggest a way in which customary communal land tenure can be integrated into the established Anglo-Australian legal system.'\"], [\"The Pacific Islands or Oceania, typically subdivided into Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia, have witnessed a virtual explosion of archaeological research, as indicated by this review of the past 5 years' literature. Most recent work centers on one or more of six major themes. Two themes are concerned with the movement of people into the Pacific region: the discovery of Pleistocene-age sites in island Melanesia and the search for early assemblages evidencing Austronesian dispersals. Substantial efforts have also focused on reconstructing prehistoric economic behavior and on assessing the impacts that colonizing human populations had on isolated and fragile island ecosystems. In the realm of social archaeology, Oceanic studies have contributed to understanding the long-term dimensions of interisland exchange and to the rise of complex, hierarchical sociopolitical systems, especially chiefdoms.\"], [\"'The study of different ethnic groups living in the same physical environment provides the opportunity to examine interaction of genetic and environmental factors in the aetiology of diabetes mellitus. In rural New Caledonia, the prevalence of diabetes was higher in part-Polynesians than in Melanesians: males \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 6.6 versus 0.5%; females \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 6.3 versus 3.5% respectively. The prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance (impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes) was 11.5 and 15.7% in part-Polynesian males and females, respectively, and 4.7 and 9.2% in Melanesian males and females.

Contrary to our initial expectation of the deep flow scheme in the equatorial western boundary region, the observed results indicated a fairly complicated flow configuration. We analyzed the results with the help of a high-resolution model simulation. The ensemble average of the horizontal flow at each level near the deep western boundary indicates a significant westward flow at 2000 and 2250\\\\xc2\\\\xa0m, with an insignificant southward component at 2500 and 2750\\\\xc2\\\\xa0m. The annual mean meridional transports are very small (>1\\\\xc2\\\\xa0Sv) and insignificant, with an ensemble-averaged value of 0.3\\\\xc2\\\\xa0Sv (southward) \\\\xc2\\\\xb10.4\\\\xc2\\\\xa0Sv at most. Combining this with high-resolution model results, it is deduced that the southward transport of the deep western boundary current (DWBC) leaving the equator may be smaller than those obtained by low-resolution models, because of trapping of its fairly large fraction in the equatorial zone. Annual-scale flow patterns are classified into several categories, mainly based on the meridional-flow dominating or the zonal-flow dominating pattern. A case of the meridional-flow dominating patterns may possibly capture an annual-scale variability of DWBC, because its meridional transport variation, though somewhat weak, is consistent with that simulated. The zonal-flow dominating regime includes two types: long-lasting, almost steady westward flows and long-term zonal flow oscillations. The former seems to comprise well-known zonally elongated and meridionally narrow structures of the zonal flow beneath the thermocline in the equatorial region. The ensemble-averaged flow mentioned above is dominated by this type at the upper two levels 2000 and 2250\\\\xc2\\\\xa0m, with total westward transport of 1.6\\\\xc2\\\\xa0\\\\xc2\\\\xb1\\\\xc2\\\\xa00.7\\\\xc2\\\\xa0Sv.

EAG recordings from natural and synthetic pheromone and a pitfall olfactometer were poorly informative. In contrast, extensive field trapping trials with various synthetic pheromone mixtures and doses showed that 1 and 2 (formulated in polyethylene sachets in 90:5 v:v ratio) were necessary and sufficient for optimum long-range attraction. Beetles were captured in traps baited with racemic 1 plus 2, with or without a stereoisomer mixture of 3 (2.5- to 2500-mg/day doses). Plant pieces, either sugarcane or coconut, enhanced captures by the synthetic pheromone, which was active alone. Traps with the pheromone caught both sexes in a 3:2 female\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93male ratio.

While admitting that little can be done to eradicate the desire for cash and the products it can buy, I suggest that Melanesian communities and the environment itself would receive more protection if future development in Papua New Guinea embraced a system which incorporated certain of the traditional Melanesian values through the preservation of the communal form of land tenure. Ultimately, I suggest a way in which customary communal land tenure can be integrated into the established Anglo-Australian legal system.'\"], [\"The Pacific Islands or Oceania, typically subdivided into Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia, have witnessed a virtual explosion of archaeological research, as indicated by this review of the past 5 years' literature.

The study also developed and implemented a series of surveys for detecting antibodies to B. abortus in cattle in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands contributing to OIE requirements. The findings indicated lack of funds, lack of technical capacity, shortage of veterinarians, high turnover of in-country officials and lack of awareness on the impacts of animal diseases on public health that were constraining active disease surveillance.

Some of the reasons why these were constraints are discussed with likely solutions presented. The detection surveys had the objectives of building capacity for the country officials and demonstrating freedom from brucellosis in cattle for PNG, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. PNG, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands all demonstrated freedom from bovine brucellosis in the areas surveyed using the indirect ELISA test.

The article concludes by examining why there are still grounds for cautious optimism, and the challenges that Pacific Island countries face in reducing the impact of malaria on their populations.

The Munda and Paradise populations consist of Austronesian (AN)-speaking Melanesians; the Rawaki population consists of AN-speaking Micronesians who migrated from the Gilbert Islands to the New Georgia Islands approximately 30\\\\xc2\\\\xa0years ago.

All layers are digitalized allowing area computations of polygons associated with the various data sets. For each island, the following are computed: total area, good arable land area, coconut plantations, pastures/grasslands, area under land lease titles and average accessible good land per household. Although Vanuatu is often considered as not densely populated (19\\\\xc2\\\\xa0hab/km2), results indicate great variation among islands. The average area of good land per household varies from 530\\\\xc2\\\\xa0ha on the island of Tegua (North) to 0.5\\\\xc2\\\\xa0ha on Futuna (South). Shifting cultivation does not appear to be a serious threat to the environment.

That number would have likely been considerably higher were it not for the appropriate reaction of the indigenous coastal populations and a helpful physical geography. Buffering coral reefs reflected some wave energy back to sea, reducing the power of the wave. Hills a short distance behind the coastal villages provided accessible havens. Despite this beneficial physiography, immigrant populations died at disproportionately high rates in comparably damaged areas because they did not recognize the signs of the impeding tsunami. The indigenous population of Tapurai, which lacks a steep barrier reef to reflect the incoming energy, experienced a much more powerful wave, and the population suffered heavy losses. Indigenous knowledge as an integral tool in basin wide tsunami warning systems has the potential to mitigate disasters in the near field.

The findings of recent sediment core studies, however, challenge this conventional wisdom and indicate some species may be native. The majority of ant species in remote Polynesia, however, are introductions from tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Despite this diversity of origins, and the lack of a common coevolutionary history in the region, patterns of organization in remote Polynesian ant communities are generally similar to those observed in coevolved continental areas. The distribution of ant species across Polynesia is consistent with a primary mechanism of anthropogenic introductions, with the availability of suitable habitat as a secondary mechanism. The species-area relationship for better-collected Polynesian islands reveals these islands are depauperate compared to Melanesian islands with endemic species.

The Pacific abyssal basins of the Western thalassogen are subdivided into three types: intermontane, interfault, and syneclise-type. The new term thalassosyneclise is proposed for the third type. Basins of the first, second, and third types are developed in the western, northeastern, and southern Pacific, respectively. The main mechanism responsible for the formation of basins belonging to the first two types is a stepwise subsidence of the oceanic bottom. The formation of a thalassosyneclise abyssal basin is probably related to energy flux of the South Pacific plume.'\"], [\"The Pacific Islands are undoubtedly vulnerable to famine. There is varied evidence of past famines in the local Pacific languages, in the ethnographic accounts of Pacific islands, and in the reports of the missionary groups. This famine vulnerability is because of the prevalence of natural disasters and the limited ability of the different island social systems to adapt to these extreme events. The famine vulnerability in the Pacific islands bears both similarities and dissimilarities to the more researched vulnerability of South Asia. Five recent examples of famines or potential famines strongly suggest that the Pacific islands remain liable to famine and that the rapid influx of foreign food relief recently does not remove the islands' inherent susceptibility to famine. By masking the terminal symptoms of famine crises, the influx of food relief may cause loss of the opportunity to develop more sustainable island food systems.\"], [\"'Remote Oceania was colonized initially in three migratory phases: the western archipelagos of Micronesia plus eastern Melanesia out to west Polynesia in the period 3500\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x932800\\\\xc2\\\\xa0cal BP (all dates hereafter are cal BP), central and eastern Micronesia 2200\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x932000 BP and east and south Polynesia 1100\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93700 BP. The early and late migration phases are best-known archaeologically. During these phases a number of plants and animals were introduced. Of the latter, the pig (Sus scrofa), dog (Canis familiaris), fowl or chicken (Gallus gallus) and rats (Rattus spp., especially R. exulans) were most deliberately associated with human settlement. The pattern of introductions appears to be only partly in agreement with an implication of widespread early distribution derived from the orthodox colonisation model of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98transported landscape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 coupled with sophisticated seafaring. Within the two main migrations the pattern of introductions is similar. Excepting in the movement to West Micronesia, all four taxa were transported into the islands nearest their proximate sources at, or soon after, the beginning of migration, but their introduction to more remote islands was partial and patchy. Evaluation of invasibility, invasiveness and transportability characteristics amongst the four taxa suggest that island size and complexity, propagule pressure and seafaring capability were important factors in differential distribution and survival. Seafaring capability was especially important because it determined the extent of accessibility to islands near and far and the degree of propagule or introduction pressure that was exerted. Framing the archaeological data within a model of invasion biology offers a richer and more systematic approach to the complexities of introduction than adopting a culture-historical perspective.'\"], [\"' DNA variation on the non-recombining portion of the Y\\\\xc2\\\\xa0chromosome was examined in 610 male samples from 14 global populations in north, east, and southeast Asia, and other regions of the world.

Maximum parsimony tree for the eight haplotypes showed that these haplotypes could be classified into four distinct lineages characterized by three key mutations: an insertion of the Y\\\\xc2\\\\xa0Alu polymorphic (YAP) element at DYS287, a C-to-G transversion at M9, and a C-to-T transition at RPS4Y 711. Of the four lineages, three major lineages (defined by the allele of YAP+, M9-G, and RPS4Y-T, respectively) accounted for 98.6% of the Asian populations studied, indicating that these three paternal lineages have contributed to the formation of modern Asian populations. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis revealed three monophyletic Asian clusters, which consisted of north Asian, Japanese, and Han Chinese/southeast Asian populations, respectively. Coalescence analysis in the haplotype tree showed that the estimated ages for three key mutations ranged from 53,000 to 95,000\\\\xc2\\\\xa0years, suggesting that the three lineages were separated from one another during early stages of human evolutionary history. The distribution patterns of the Y-haplotypes and mutational ages for the key markers suggest that three major groups with different paternal ancestries separately migrated to prehistoric east and southeast Asia.'\"], [\"'Quaternary sediments in the Woodlark Basin and New Georgia Sound, adjacent to the Solomon Islands volcanic arc, are hemipelagic.

Much of the sedimentary debris is delivered to the basin by turbidity currents and other mass movements; little material is supplied by ash fall.

This was sustained through agro-ecological biodiversity, the production of surpluses which enabled food preservation and storage to be practiced and underpinned networks of exchange and mutual support that were particularly important during times of hardship such as disruptive extreme natural events, the use of resilient crops and using \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98famine\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 foods. Colonisation, the introduction of new religions, the spread of capitalism, most recently in the context of globalisation, has seen many of these practices decline (some have disappeared altogether) as crop diversity has been reduced (making way for export products such as copra), food storage and preservation are now rarely practised, resilient crops have been replaced, famine foods have lost their importance in the face of disaster relief, and many traditional networks have declined. Food imports have become critical, not only in the growing urban areas, but also in rural communities. The paper concludes by addressing key challenges facing Pacific Island countries in order to revitalise those traditional elements of food security in ways that are likely to find acceptance in contemporary society and enable them to adapt to the effects of climate change.'\"], [\"'Although aquatic resources are often seen as central to the development of post-Pleistocene cultural complexity, most models of human evolution have all but ignored the role of aquatic or maritime adaptations during the earlier stages of human history. When did aquatic resources, maritime adaptations, and seafaring first play a significant role in human evolution? I explore this fundamental question by (1) reviewing various theories on the subject; (2) discussing a variety of problems that prevent archaeologists from providing a clear answer; and (3) examining the archaeological record for evidence of early aquatic resource use or seafaring. I conclude that aquatic resources, wherever they were both abundant and relatively accessible, have probably always been used opportunistically by our ancestors. Evidence suggests, however, that aquatic and maritime adaptations (including seafaring) played a significantly greater role in the demographic and geographic expansion of anatomically modern humans after about 150,000 years ago. Another significant expansion occurred somewhat later in time, with the development of more sophisticated seafaring, fishing, and marine hunting technologies.'\"], [\"'The south Pacific region contains a large genetic resource for the genetic improvement of coconut palms (Cocos nucifera L.). A study of the diversity in the species was made during 1992/3 using fruit component analysis on a representative sample from 29 distinct south Pacific populations in order to characterise the germplasm present in the region. A large diversity in fruit morphology was found that ranged from populations exhibiting wild-type characters in central Pacific to populations displaying domesticated characteristics in Rennell Island, the Sikaiana Islands, the Marquesas Islands, and in Papua New Guinea. Many populations exhibited fruit characteristics intermediate between the two, which were thought to have arisen due to introgressive hybridisation between the wild and domesticated populations. Continuous variation in fruit morphology was found in these populations, and cluster analysis arbitrarily divided the continuum into discrete groups which were consistent with geographic affinities. Groups were defined in Melanesia, Western Polynesia and Eastern Polynesia. The continuum displayed clinal variation from populations with small fruit and low husk content in the west to large fruit and more husk in the east of the region. The wild and domesticated populations were found in disjunct pockets throughout the area, and did not form part of the clines. Most populations consisted of a wide range of fruit morphology, from individuals expressing wild-type characters to those with domestic-type characters. The occurrence of both wild and domesticated populations within the clinal variation indicates that further exploration should be made to determine the presence of other potentially useful populations.

The orthodox view is that Neolithic farmers spread south by sea from mainland China to Taiwan and thence to Island Southeast Asia, taking with them a new material culture and domestic rice and pigs and speaking the precursor of the Austronesian languages that are spoken in the region today. Opponents of this \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98farming/language dispersal\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 theory have proposed models of acculturation, in which foragers acquired new material culture and food resources by trading with farmers. However, new work in archaeology, palaeoecology, palynology and anthropology, especially in Borneo, and in genetics and linguistics for the region as a whole, is suggesting that foraging/farming transitions in Southeast Asia were far more complex than either of these opposing \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98grand narratives\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 of discontinuity (population colonisation) or continuity (acculturation) allows.

Whilst new readings of the data for foraging\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93farming transitions in the region vary, a consensus is emerging that it is more useful to focus on how materials and modes of life were used to underwrite changes in social networks than to seek to explain the archaeological record in terms of migrating farmers or acculturating foragers.'\"], [\"'Technological advances are making genetic data collection and analysis feasible on a scale unimaginable only a few years ago. Early genetic research using mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome provided important insights for macroscale modeling of regional and continent-wide population movements, but the capacity to study the entire genome now opens an era of finer-grained, mesoscale studies of regional and local population histories that are more compatible with the scale of archaeological analysis. The utility of integrating both types of data is illustrated by a case study from Oceania, where genetic studies were used to evaluate two models for the geographic origins of the populations that colonized Polynesia beginning ca. 3000 bp, bringing with them the distinctive Lapita cultural assemblage. A second case study considers the application of genetic studies to an understanding of Fulbe history, especially that of the pastoral Fulbe. Both archaeological and genetic data are underdeveloped for the key Fulbe homeland regions of Mauritania and Senegal, but recent research in the Middle Senegal Valley permits some conjectures on the history of Fulbe nomadic pastoralism.

Biomolecular evidence for plant domestication in Sahul is presented and discussed. Biomolecular markers reveal that for these crops at least, domestication has occurred in New Guinea and further east in Melanesia. This domestication produced cultivated genotypes that were selected from the endemic wild gene pools. These areas of domestication still are important centres of diversity for crop species that also exist in Asia. For most crops, genetic distances are very important between the two gene pools due to the geographic isolation of the two continental plates. The implications of these findings have obvious bearings on genetic resources programme strategies and future surveys.'\"], [\"'Subsistence agriculture in the Pacific Islands has a complex prehistory centered on western Melanesia. Based on an analysis of cultigen provenience, a sequential model of a three-tiered crop structure of indigenous agricultural systems has been derived: (1) The independent early domestication of endemic species in the New Guinea region; (2) introduction of species from Southeast Asia; (3) the advent of American crop plants. The temporal sequence has archaeological and linguistic confirmation of 10 000 years ago for the beginnings of agriculture, 6000 years for Southeast Asian introduction, with the sweet potato contributing in Polynesia in prehistory, and in Melanesia only in post-Columbian times. Recent research directed toward issues of domestication in New Guinea and subsistence prehistory in Australia on three genera,Canarium, Colocasia andIpomoea, exemplify under-recognized resources with quite different potentials for economic botany.

The frequency content of the first-arriving P-waves is lower for paths across the Ontong Java plateau than for the east Mariana basin. The disparate crustal thicknesses of the Ontong Java plateau and east Mariana basin may influence the relative amplitude of oceanic Pn, with smaller amplitudes corresponding to a thicker crust. Pn-P differential times for the Ontong Java plateau show a general decrease with the depth of earthquake focus but no comparable trend is seen in the Mariana data, possibly because of the scatter. The observation of high-frequency oceanic Pn propagation across the Ontong Java Plateau is suggestive that the plateau is not of continental origin.'\"], [\"'Over millennia of breadfruit cultivation, hundreds of named cultivars have been developed that display a high degree of morphological diversity.

Further selection of true seedless, smooth-skinned cultivars of A. altilis appears to have occurred with human migrations from Melanesia into Polynesia. Cultivars from Micronesia exhibit morphological characteristics indicative of hybridization with the endemic species A. mariannensis. These data were used to generate a multi-access cultivar identification key on the Lucid platform that can be used to identify trees of known cultivars or to predict nearest cultivar relationships for previously undescribed cultivars.

These phenomena are especially typical of archipelagoes, where different taxa occur on closely located islands. The diverse ecological conditions of the islands determine the presence of a great number of subordinate taxa.

Islands of continental origin (Sumatra, Borneo) have a lower level of endemism, with centers on the mountain ranges. The endemism level is much higher in islands of biogenic origin (the Philippines). The Pacific islands have a higher index of specific endemism. At the same time, the islands of mixed and oceanic origin have low species diversity by a large fraction of endemic taxa.

Ethnographic interviews were used to quantitatively evaluate hypotheses about community perceptions of differences between the species. Weighted and unweighted evaluations were made within emic activity categories based upon frequency of interaction withCanarium and importance of species selectivity within the interaction activity. No significant difference was found between the species based upon unweighted frequency of use within activity categories.

It is argued that the small island states appear vulnerable to climatic change, with low coral atolls being most at risk. Adverse impacts of climatic change will be one extra pressure on small island states, many of which are already struggling to cope with sustainable management of their natural resources and with the demands of their rapidly growing populations for education, housing and employment.

The techniques of gene and haplotype analysis offer new hope in addressing this issue, and we review relevant studies of three haemoglobinopathies: sickle cell anaemia, and \\\\xce\\\\xb1 and \\\\xce\\\\xb2 thalassaemia. We show how for each disease it is possible to recognize a pattern of regionally specific mutations, found in association with one or a few haplotypes, that is best explained as the result of selection; other patterns are due to population migration and genetic drift. However, we caution that such conclusions can be drawn in special circumstances only. In the case of the haemoglobinopathies it is possible because a selective agent (malaria) was already suspected, and the investigations could be carried out in relatively genetically homogenous populations whose migratory histories are known. Moreover, some data reviewed here suggest that gene conversion and the haplotype composition of a population may affect the frequency of a mutation, making interpretation of gene frequencies difficult on the basis of standard population genetics theory. Hence attempts to use the same approaches with other genetic diseases are likely to be frustrated by a lack of suitably untrammelled populations and by difficulties accounting for poorly understood genetic processes. We conclude that although this combination of molecular and population genetics is successful when applied to the study of haemoglobinopathies, it may not be so easy to apply it to the study of other genetic diseases.'\"], [\"'Auditory exostoses have been included in craniological investigations since the last century and recently comprised among epigenetic traits.

Beyond the Atlantic, a similar situation is characteristic of the southern Indian Ocean only. Hence, differentiated energetic models of deep geospheres are required. The relations of potentially economic fields of ferromanganese nodules to tectonic types of abyssal basins are discussed. The largest fields with respect to both dimensions and reserves are confined to interfault and intermontane abyssal basins. The fields localized in central thalassogenic basins are second in importance. The perispreading and pericontinental basins are the least promising in this respect. Along with other criteria, tectonic analysis should be taken into consideration in the future development of these valuable mineral resources.'\"], [\"'The colonization of Oceania occurred in two waves. By 32,000 BP, humans had reached New Guinea and settled all intervisible islands east to the Solomon Islands. Around 3,500 BP, a distinct intrusive group from Southeast Asia reached coastal New Guinea, integrated their components with indigenous resources, and gave rise to the Lapita Cultural Complex. Within 2,500\\\\xc2\\\\xa0years, Lapita and its descendant cultures colonized the Pacific. To uncover the origin of the Lapita Cultural Complex, we analyzed the hypervariable region I of the mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) in 219 individuals from eight East Sepik Province villages: two villages in each of four environmental zones. Same-zone villages spoke different languages: one Austronesian and three Papuan (Arapesh, Abelam, and Boiken). Our analysis examined whether language or geography better predicted gene flow. In general, language better predicted genetic affinities. Boiken villages across all four zones showed no significant genetic difference (FST  P value\\\\xc2\\\\xa0>\\\\xc2\\\\xa00.05). In contrast, the Austronesian village was significantly different to most other villages (P\\\\xc2\\\\xa0<\\\\xc2\\\\xa00.05). Only the mountains and coast showed zonal gene flow (P\\\\xc2\\\\xa0>\\\\xc2\\\\xa00.05). We interpret the data to reflect limited gene flow inland by Austronesians overshadowed by a regional displacement by inland Boiken speakers migrating seaward. These results are consistent with oral histories and ethnographic accounts.'\"], [\"'In the oceans of the tropical and warm-temperate zone (40\\\\xc2\\\\xb0 N\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9340\\\\xc2\\\\xb0 S), only a small number of islands are high enough to show timberline and alpine vegetation.

Rocks of the first period are \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cisland arc tholeiites\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d; of the second, a calc-alkaline series; and of the third, shoshonites. Each period has a geochemical distinctiveness. The temporal sequence also corresponds to a spatial zonation analogous to that observed in many currently active island arcs. K2O and the larger trace elements increase south to north and with time, whereas iron enrichment and Na2O/K2O ratios decrease. Initial Sr 87/86 ratios average about 0.7041 in rocks of all periods.

To determine the geographical distribution of seropositivity to HTLV-I in PNG we have tested 2907 serum and plasma samples collected between 1972 to 1991 from 16 different population groups. Samples were screened using a particle agglutination assay and confirmed by p21e-enhanced Western immunoblot (WB). From a total of 94 screen positive samples run on WB, 56 (60%) were confirmed positive (positive for bothenv andgag products) and 38 (40%) were WB-indeterminate (gag products only). The prevalence of WB-confirmed antibodies to HTLV-I in lowland and island populations ranged from 0 to 5.4%. There were no confirmed antibody positives in the highland populations surveyed. Geographically isolated populations living on the fringes of the highlands ranged in seropositivity from 0.2 to 5.8%. Two of the subjects surveyed gave WB antibody patterns characteristic of HTLV-II rather than HTLV-I infection.'\"], [\"'Based on the summarized geological and petrogeochemical information on the basaltic magmatism on the Pacific Ocean floor, the formation-geochemical rock types, their associations in the oceanic morpho-structures, and petrological provinces were distinguished.

The remaining species are attributed to four genera, Kanakyella, Pidaconomus, Caledoconcha, and Leiorhagium, which are all introduced in this paper.'\"], [\"'A semi-systematic literature review of national policies was carried out in relation to surveillance and disease reporting in Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs). It also analysed the animal disease reporting structures in Fiji, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. The strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of those reporting structures were examined in relation to how they impacted the detection and management of animal diseases in PICTs. Field missions collected information on animal disease reporting structures and these were discussed in detail with country officials and documented. The findings from the literature review indicated that there is very little policy to support work in surveillance and disease reporting within national government structures of the countries studied. This increases the potential for disease transmission and the introduction of exotic diseases as the efficiency of disease reporting is low. The findings from the SWOT analysis of the reporting structures indicated that there were commonalities across the countries studied, i.e. reporting structures were long with multiple legs that were not functioning properly and this was worsened when positions were vacant in the reporting structure. The hierarchical nature of the reporting structure also reduced reporting efficiency as reports took a longer time to reach decision makers at the top of the structure. High officer turnover and the shortage of veterinarians in the countries studied also affected the efficiency of disease reporting as most in-county officials were inexperienced and could not recognise disease signs and there were no veterinarians to supervise them. Existing reporting structures need to be reviewed to remove duplication and shorten the chain. However, this could override existing command structures and would need to be documented and awareness created with the officers involved. There also needs to be more collaboration with FAO, OIE, academic institutions and national governments to create an environment conducive for the development of policies that support work on surveillance to improve disease reporting in PICTs. The shortage of veterinarians could be addressed by influencing national governments to create better policies to retain veterinarians in the animal health services; this should be supported by creating reasonable work conditions and remuneration packages. This should also be supported with policies to send young graduates to study veterinary science overseas and have a career path for them when they return. Engagement of retired veterinarians from developed countries and re-evaluating the criteria for veterinarian registration could be short-term solutions to address the shortage of veterinarians in PICTs.'\"], [\"'Adolescent obesity is prevalent in Pacific region ethnic groups (European, Melanesian and Polynesian) living in both urban and rural areas. Although body perception is an important factor of weight gain or loss, little is known about the body self-perceptions of Pacific region adolescents.

Despite this pivotal position, archaeological information for the region is scarce due to limited investigations, limited publication and the multilingual nature of publications. Consequently, little archaeological information about western New Guinea has percolated into the mainstream literature. This paper aims to fill this gap and provides a detailed review of archaeological research, including rock art, published in Dutch, English, French, German and Indonesian. The resultant findings are discussed in terms of continuities and discontinuities with Papua New Guinea and Island Southeast Asia.'\"], [\"'\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94We present relocations of over 220 historical and recent earthquakes in the northwestern part of Irian Jaya, in the context of the large earthquakes of 1979 and 1996.

Vector control measures, such as indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal bed nets (LLINs) are key integral components of this programme.

These factors need to be investigated locally prior to programme implementation.'\"], [\"'Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) methods and philosophies were trialed in a volcanic risk management planning and awareness activity for Savo Island, a historically highly destructive volcano in the Solomon Islands. Through a combination of methods we tried to combine the roles of facilitators and educators, and to involve the input of all stakeholders (from community to national government) in the process of volcanic risk management. The PRA approach was an ideal way to address the fundamental differences in outlook, education, needs, and roles of individuals and groups involved or affected. It was also an important catalyst to Savo island- or community-based planning initiatives, which are arguably the most important step toward the preparedness of the 2500 inhabitants of the island for any future destructive volcanic activity. We adapted almost every tenet of the PRA philosophy through inexperience, self-perceived importance and desire to combine both scientific and traditional views for Savo volcanic risk management planning. Nevertheless, what emerged from our experiences was an idea of how fundamentally well suited many PRA approaches are to initiating dialogue within diverse stakeholder groups, and deriving combined scientific/geologic and local/community risk assessments and mitigation action plans. The main challenge remaining includes increasing the involvement or voice of less powerful community members (women, youth, non-landowners) in risk management decision-making in such male-dominated hierarchical societies.'\"], [\"'This paper explores the risks that climate change poses to food security in the islands of the South Pacific. It shows that climate change will adversely affect food systems in the region, including the supply of food from agriculture and fisheries, the ability of countries to import food, systems for the distribution of food, and the ability of households to purchase and utilize food. In these ways, climate change puts at risk the very basic and universal need for people in the islands to have access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food at all times. It is argued that for people in the South Pacific, the risks climate change poses to food security constitutes a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98dangerous\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 change in climate.'\"], [\"' Savo Island is the 6-km-diameter emergent summit of an andesitic-dacitic stratovolcano, rising from the Iron Bottom Sound, 35\\\\xc2\\\\xa0km NW of Honiara, Solomon Islands. Savo has erupted at least three times within recorded history and the 3,000 inhabitants maintain extensive oral traditions of past events. Through description and interpretation of the volcaniclastic sequences on the island, in conjunction with historical accounts and oral traditions, we reconstruct the eruptive processes on Savo. Block-and-ash flow (BAF) deposits are volumetrically dominant on the island within three main depositional environments: near-vent sequences, thick medial channel sequences and distal fan sequences. The deposits comprise universally non-vesicular and highly porphyritic (40\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9370% phenocrysts), high-silica andesite and dacite clasts. These appear to have been derived from collapsing lava domes during an 1560\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x931570\\\\xc2\\\\xa0A.D. eruption. However, eyewitness descriptions and crater morphology suggest that similar deposits formed from dome explosions or collapses of eruption columns during later eruptions (1830\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x931840\\\\xc2\\\\xa0A.D.). The high-sodium magmas (ca. 5\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x937\\\\xc2\\\\xa0wt% Na2O) apparently crystallised and strongly degassed prior to eruption. Shallow explosions were possibly caused by entrapment of magmatic gases beneath a dome or conduit plug of highly crystalline, near solid magma. Repeated sealing of the vent may have been due to inward collapse of the highly altered rocks of the surrounding hydrothermal system; these rocks probably were saturated due to contemporaneous high intensity rainfall events. BAFs were hot enough to char vegetation and attain aligned clast TRM (thermal remnant magnetism) up to 3\\\\xc2\\\\xa0km from the vent, many being accompanied by ash-cloud surges. Changes with distance in the BAF deposits appear mostly dependent on flow confinement and are limited to an overall decrease in thickness and maximum clast size, and an increased definition of weak planar fabrics. In distal fan sequences, there is strong evidence for syn- and post-eruptive redeposition of primary deposits. Since the Savo population is concentrated on coastal volcaniclastic fans, we consider the greatest volcanic risk to life is from BAFs, associated ash-cloud surges and lahars. Hence, the main channels and fans are designated as the highest of three relative hazard zones on a simple map prepared to aid local education and planning initiatives on Savo.'\"], [\"'A thorough understanding of the Pacific Ocean circulation is a necessity to solve global climate and environmental problems. Here we present a new picture of the circulation by integrating observational results. Lower and Upper Circumpolar Deep Waters (LCDW, UCDW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) of 12, 7, and 5 Sv (106 m3s\\\\xe2\\\\x88\\\\x921) in the lower and upper deep layers and the surface/intermediate layer, respectively, are transported to the North Pacific from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The flow of LCDW separates in the Central Pacific Basin into the western (4 Sv) and eastern (8 Sv) branches, and nearly half of the latter branch is further separated to flow eastward south of the Hawaiian Ridge into the Northeast Pacific Basin (NEPB). A large portion of LCDW on this southern route (4 Sv) upwells in the southern and mid-latitude eastern regions of the NEPB. The remaining eastern branch joins nearly half of the western branch; the confluence flows northward and enters the NEPB along the Aleutian Trench. Most of the LCDW on this northern route (5 Sv) upwells to the upper deep layer in the northern (in particular northeastern) region of the NEPB and is transformed into North Pacific Deep Water (NPDW). NPDW shifts southward in the upper deep layer and is modified by mixing with UCDW around the Hawaiian Islands. The modified NPDW of 13 Sv returns to the ACC. The remaining volume in the North Pacific (11 Sv) flows out to the Indian and Arctic Oceans in the surface/intermediate layer.'\"], [\"'\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Sidescan sonar observations show that mass wasting plays an important role in the geologic development of the Savaii Island edifice. Observations on the south and west flanks indicate that debris movement on the submarine slopes between rift zones is characterized by large sheets of unchannelized debris. Farther downslope these sheets have slumped into folded although still relatively coherent slump sheets. Closer to the rift zones, more chaotic slumps are found. The presence of large detached landslide blocks, without obvious upslope headwall scarps, suggests that earlier slumps are covered by subsequent veneers of debris moving downslope.\\\\xc2\\\\xb6In contrast, on Stearns Bank west of the island of Savaii most of the features are of constructional origin, formed during  the building of this volcanic edifice of unknown age. Two prominentsubmarine platforms are evident, the shallower one with a summit cone. Sea cliffs and subdued terraces record platforms cut by sea-level oscillations late in the history of the volcanic edifice. Fractures and fissures are present on the bank, however there is little evidence of landslides in this area. The absence of landslides may reflect differing ages of the bank and the island or the edifice could have remained submarine during its construction with few or no subaerially derived ashes and clays present to facilitate mass wasting.\\\\xc2\\\\xb6We conclude that mass wasting is an important influence on the evolution of the Savaii volcanic edifice. It appears that sediment and debris cover most of the slope outside the submarine rift zones. The sonar images indicate that mass wasting is a common process in the submarine environment. Unlike the giant landslides documented by GLORIA imagery around the Hawaiian Islands, the southern margin of Samoa is characterized by numerous small slumps and slides. Although we have little information at present regarding the recurrence interval for submarine landslides, their ubiquitous presence in these sidescan sonar records indicates that they are an important component of the geologic record of the Samoan Islands.\\\\n'\"], [\"'Pacific Island populations, particularly those of Polynesian descent, have a high prevalence of hyperuricaemia and gout. This is due to an inherently higher urate level among these populations with a demonstrated genetic predisposition. While an excess of urate can cause pathology, urate is also important for human health. It has been implicated as an antioxidant, has a neuroprotective role and is involved in innate immune responses. This paper provides a brief review of urate levels worldwide, with a particular focus on island Southeast Asia and the Pacific. We then present possible evolutionary explanations for the elevated serum urate levels among Pacific populations in the context of the physiological importance of urate and of the settlement history of the region. Finally, we propose that ancestry may play a significant role in hyperuricaemia in these populations and that exposure to malaria prior to population expansion into the wider Pacific may have driven genetic selection for variants contributing to high serum urate.'\"], [\"This article analyses the role of education in incorporating Australia's Melanesian minority, the Torres Strait Islanders, into the Australian nation. The analysis begins with the introduction of Queensland government schooling into Torres Strait in 1892, which fostered expectations of Queensland citizenship and employment opportunities available to other races in the economy of the Strait. From 1904 to the outbreak of world war II in the Pacific in 1942 these early directions were altered by educational policies which initially sought to train Islanders for a life in the Islands as a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9crace apart\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d from the rest of Australia. Subsequent syllabus reforms, paralleling but not equalling regular schooling offered in Queensland, did not meet Islanders' aspirations for \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cproper schooling\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and the jobs they expected would flow from it. Following world war II, regulations confining Islanders to the Strait were relaxed and many migrated to the Queensland mainland in search of better jobs, better pay, and better education for their children. Those who remained in the Islands received an education which, by 1985, had been brought up to the mainland standard. Yet, neither group's educational aspirations were satisfied despite initiatives and financial incentives of the Commonwealth government aimed at keeping Islander children at school. The article concludes that the way ahead for Islanders in staking out their educational future in the Australian nation on a basis of equality with other Australians lies in educational developments in the Islands themselves, where Islanders are playing an active role in developing, managing, and guiding schooling in directions which recognise their identity and their citizenship aspirations.\"], [\"'The biodiversity hotspot concept was defined by Myers in 1988 to determine priority areas for conservation. They have high endemism levels and have lost more than 70% of their original vegetated area. To date, there is little information on arthropod diversity in these zones. This work focuses on the biodiversity of the Phytoseiidae (Acari), one of the best known among the order Mesostigmata, in these threatened areas. These mites are usually predators and they are worldwide spread. Geographic distribution of phytoseiids in 27 biodiversity hostspots was assessed from data of the last world catalogue published in 2004. One thousand two hundred and thirty species are reported from at least one hotspot (62% of the total species number) and 604 species (30% of the total species number) are endemic to the 27 hotspots considered. The number of reports/publication in hotspot areas (2.6) is higher than in non-hotspot zones (1.5). Hotspots areas could be thus considered as a great reservoir of the Phytoseiidae diversity, just as they are for vertebrates and plants. Correlations between plant, vertebrate, mite diversity and endemism, as well as congruence rates between endemism levels of these three organisms suggest that the biodiversity patterns of plants and vertebrates mirror well those of the Phytoseiidae (both for endemicity and species richness). More intense conservation efforts in biodiversity hotspots would thus be assumed to affect plant and vertebrate biodiversity, as already known, but also arthropod biodiversity, as it was assumed. These results further support thus the importance of these zones in biodiversity conservation, even for organisms like mites, very small and poorly studied in this regards. More data on arthropods are, however, required to confirm these preliminary observations.'\"], [\"'The islands of North Maluku, Indonesia occupy a central position in the major prehistoric dispersal streams that shaped the peoples of Island Southeast Asia and the Pacific.

However, indigenous cultures in particular may have distinctly different systematic ways of referring to space and thinking mathematically about spatial activity. Their approaches are based on the close link between the environment and cultural activity. The affinity to place strengthens the efficient, abstract, mathematical system behind the reference and its connection to the real world of place and a holistic worldview. This paper sets out to present an overview of various approaches to aspects of space and geometry by drawing on linguistic and cultural literature, my collaborative research in Papua New Guinea, and from personal communications with indigenous colleagues in Australia and elsewhere. This diversity provides a challenge by which teachers can deconstruct their thinking about mathematics and subsequently to review the content of teaching and to be more responsive to the diversity of cultural backgrounds of students. To assist with recognising ecocultural mathematics on space and geometry, 4 principles are established and discussed on language structures, reference lines and points, measures of space and worldviews and interpretations of space as place.'\"], [\"'In recent decades, Pacific Region indigenous sea tenure regimes have received considerable attention from social scientists who believe thatmarine-localized common entitlements and fishing practices can aid modern littoral fisheries management. The endorsement of sea tenure institutions as managerial tools, however, has proceeded without adequate consideration of their vulnerability to social and economic changes. The general view held by researchers is that Pacific Island sea tenure regimes are generally undermined by the influence of exogenous forces resulting in an open-access commons. In this article, it is argued that the contemporary transformation of sea tenure regimes emerges not only from exogenous agency, but from a complex set of autochthonous processes. A case study from New Georgia, Solomon Islands, is presented to show how sea tenure regimes can vary within an ethnically and culturally homogeneous region. Three tenure models are presented to show how different pre- and post-European contact regional settlement patterns, localized processes of political expansion and contraction, and dynamic indigenous sociocultural principles have resulted in institutional differences between each sea tenure model. The effect of the market economy on the organizational structure and managerial outcomes of each model also is discussed.'\"], [\"'As an integral component of colonial culture, colonial architecture provides a tangible expression of western presence and domination throughout various colonial settings. In tropical colonies, such as Fiji, western architecture was not simply transplanted, but became transformed through the conscious integration of western and nonwestern architectural elements and grammars. Thus hybrid colonial architecture played a significant role within the sociopolitical strategies of both colonizer and colonized elites. Nasova House, the main government building of the autonomous Cakobau polity (1873\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9374) and British colonial regime (1874\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9382), provides a unique example of the use of colonial hybrid architecture in late nineteenth century Fiji.'\"], [\"There has been much recent debate about women's rights and their relation to human rights. Debates about domestic violence in Vanuatu are situated in this global frame but also in a regional and historical context dominated by the relation between kastom (tradition) and Christianity. This article depicts the dynamics of a conference on Violence and the Family in Vanuatu held in Port Vila in 1994, in terms of the competing claims of universal human rights and cultural relativism. The allegedly western character of human rights which focus on the individual and civil and political rights is often contrasted with the non-western stress on collectivities and the rights to economic development and self-determination. These sorts of ideological oppositions in international politics reverberate in domestic politics as well, and especially in those which situate women and men as subjects in conflict, as they are in many domestic disputes.\"], [\"'Four types of ethnic conflict are found in the ten states of post-colonial Southeast Asia.

The correlation with depth to the Benioff zone is therefore the reverse of that typically found in island arcs. REE evidence and source modelling indicates that this variation represents a progressive depletion in LREE/HREE in the upper mantle, laterally away from the trench and a progressive increase in partial melting of the source, in the same direction. These variations in chemistry are attributed to an earlier west-dipping Miocene subduction system, and the variation in degree of partial melting to the location of the islands with respect to the active back-arc basin. An enrichment of the upper mantle in the Miocene is ascribed to the ascent of hydrous fluids enriched in incompatible elements, from the west-dipping Benioff zone, and subsequent reaction with the overlying upper mantle. The model thus envisages approximately contemporaneous development of the Central Chain volcanoes and the backarc basin in the late Pliocene, with partial melting of hydrous, laterally zoned upper mantle resulting from the convective thermal regime associated with the rifting apart of the back-arc basin. The role of the present subduction regime in magma generation is considered to be very limited.'\"], [\"'The Jarawas, a classical hunter-gatherer tribe of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India, were living in isolation for several centuries.

The present study was carried out to investigate the possible origin of HBV infection in Jarawas. Genotyping, RFLP analysis, sequencing, and sequence analysis revealed the prevalence of HBV genotype C, similar to genotype C detected in Thailand, Vietnam, and Myanmar. In contrast, genotype D was prevalent among other non-Jarawa tribes of the island.

In this study, we investigated the population frequencies of these variants in six Oceanic populations (Melanesians, Micronesians, and Polynesians) and tested for an association with BMI. Unlike European populations, the Oceanic populations displayed no significant association between the FTO polymorphisms and BMI. These variants were in strong linkage disequilibrium. The population frequencies ranged between 4.2 and 30.3% in the six Oceanic populations, and were similar to those in southeast and east Asian populations. Our study of the FTO polymorphisms has generated no evidence to support the thrifty genotype hypothesis for Oceanic populations.'\"], [\"'Despite the use of a wide range of different methodologies and diagnostic criteria, epidemiological studies have shown that Type 2 (non-insulindependent) diabetes has a global distribution and its prevalence varies from country to country, in different ethnic groups in the same country, and between the same ethnic group undergoing internal or external migration. Rural-urban and migration studies indicate that change towards a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Westernized\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 lifestyle is associated with a dramatic increase in the prevalence rates for Type 2 diabetes.

Predictions derived from foraging theory concerning the abundance histories of high-return human prey and diet breadth have been met in many parts of the world. People are known to have introduced a broad variety of nondomesticated animals, from sponges to agoutis and rats, to a remarkably broad set of contexts, in turn causing a wide variety of secondary impacts. By increasing the incidence of fire, human colonists have in some cases transformed the nature of the vegetation on the colonized landscape, in turn dramatically affecting animal populations on those landscapes. In island settings, these triple threats--predation, biotic introductions, and vegetation alteration--routinely led to extinctions but there is no archaeological evidence that small-scale societies caused extinction by predation alone on islands or continents. Indeed, the recent history of this famous argument suggests that it is better seen as a statement of faith about the past rather than as an appeal to reason. Perhaps most importantly, our burgeoning knowledge of past human impacts on animals has important implications for the conservation biology of the future.'\"], [\"'The occurrence of kangaroos, wallabies and related species (Family Macropodidae) on islands of area 90 ha or more round Australia is non-random. Few islands adjacent to the northwestern, northern and eastern coasts have macropods present in contrast to a large number of islands near the mid-and southwestern coasts and most of the southern coastline. The latter group of islands was not visited by aborigines because they lacked watercraft, and most of the islands were apparently too small to support human populations. It is argued that Aboriginal man, through direct predation, his introduction of the Dingo, and his frequent use of fire, was chiefly responsible for the difference in representation of macropods on the two groups of islands.'\"], [\"'Traditional medicines, the mainstay of medical treatment for virtually all minor ailments in many developing countries, have been tapped for the production of new therapeutics in the sustenance of human health and well-being.

After a taxonomic clarification and a review of the botanical data, its geographical areas of origin and distribution are determined. A germplasm survey conducted on nine islands of Vanuatu enabled the collection of 110 accessions corresponding to 84 cultivars. These were grouped into: (1) wild forms under domestication, (2) annual types, (3) perennial-type cultivars of D. nummularia and (4) natural interspecific hybrids with D. alata L. Within each group, remarkable morphological variation exists for stem spininess, leaf shape, emerging leaf colour, tuber shape and tuber flesh colour. Selected accessions examined for ploidy had chromosome numbers ranging from 2n\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa03x\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa060 to 2n\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa06x\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa0120. Chloroplast counts conducted on stomatal guard cells confirmed the variation in ploidy levels. Eight different male cultivars were studied for pollen fertility, but <5% of the pollen grains appeared to be fertile when stained with acetocarmine. However, profuse flowering and synchrony favour pollination and result in fruit set. All accessions are resistant to anthracnose. Viruses were detected but are morphologically not discernible, with no incidence on yield. Physicochemical analyses of tubers from 16 accessions revealed that D. nummularia and interspecific hybrids have high percentages of dry matter (mean of 33.11%) and starch (82.81%). The Pacific yam could be improved through conventional hybridisation or used for interspecific crosses with related economically important species.

Head variables, being more eco-stable than body variables, remain relatively more different between two distinct populations (eastern and western villages) than do the more eco-labile body variables, although both do vary significantly between east and west. The differences apply to both men and women. These east-west contrasts reflect the differential migration of Slavs to the island over the past three centuries, with a new wave of immigrants settling mainly in the east and introducing a new gene pool to the pre-existing Slavic hybrid population which had settled the island in the sixth to the eighth centuries. In addition to the predominant east-west differences in morphology, we also find significant variation between all villages in both head and body variables. We conclude that this is an indication of the considerable reproductive isolation that has persisted between all villages until the post-World War II period.'\"], [\"May 1987 is a month that will not be forgotten in the South Pacific. The first of two military coups d'etat led by Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka not only transformed the course of post-colonial political development in Fiji, but this event also had profound implications for international relations in the region. Co-incidentally, May 1987 was also the month when detailed results of Fiji's second national population census since Independence in 1970 became available. The 1986 census documents Fiji's population on the eve of a political revolution which has the potential to cause significant economic and social change. The demographic process most likely to be affected in the short-term by the coups is population movement, both within Fiji and to overseas destinations. This: paper examines developments in population movement between 1970 and 1986 with particular reference to an acceleration in levels of migration overseas by Indians and an exodus of Fijians from rural village communities for towns on Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Trends in internal and international migration are evaluated at a range of spatial scales \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 national, regional and local.

Data for 19 microsatellite loci were collected for 349 individuals (representing 255 accessions) including breadfruit (A. altilis), two wild relatives (Artocarpus camansi and Artocarpus mariannensis), and putative hybrids (A. altilis\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89\\\\xc3\\\\x97\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89A. mariannensis). Accessions were of mixed ploidy and regional origin, but predominantly from Oceania. Microsatellite loci collectively had a polymorphic information content (PIC) of 0.627 and distinguished 197 unique genotypes sorted into 129 different lineages, but a single genotype accounts for 49\\\\xc2\\\\xa0% of all triploid breadfruit examined. Triploid hybrids and diploid A. altilis exhibited the highest levels of diversity as measured by allele number and gene diversity. Most accessions (75\\\\xc2\\\\xa0%) of unknown origin matched either a known genotype or lineage group in the collection. Putative hybrids all had genetic contributions from A. mariannensis but ranged in the level of genetic contribution from A. altilis.

Results showed greater isozyme variation in Asia than in Oceania, with Indonesia being the area of greatest diversity. No correlations were found between zymotypes and morphotypes or ploidy levels (as described by other investigators). Multivariate analyses of the isozyme data indicated that the majority of the Indonesian cultivars were different from the Philippine and Oceanian taro cultivars. Oceanian cultivars constituted a continuum of clusters and are thought to have originated from a narrow genetic base introduced from Indonesia.

About 3 per cent of Caucasians are CYP2C19 var/var. By contrast, an extremely high incidence (70 per cent) is observed in the Melanesian island of Vanuatu. The colonisation of the Pacific Islands is believed to have involved migration through Papua New Guinea (PNG), and hence a high incidence may also be expected in this population. The reported incidence in PNG was only 36 per cent, however. PNG is a country of extensive ethnic diversity, and the incidence of the CYP2C19 var/var in other regional populations of PNG is currently not established. In this study, restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction analysis of archival blood serum samples was used to determine the prevalence of the CYP2C19*2 and *3 variant alleles in three different ethnic and geographically isolated populations of PNG. In the largest population studied (Iruna), the frequency of both variant CYP2C19 alleles was high (0.37 and 0.34, respectively). Specifically, the frequency of the CYP2C19*3 allele was significantly higher than in the PNG (East Sepik) population reported previously (0.34 vs 0.16; p <0.0001). In the Iruna population, 48.9 per cent of the samples were homozygous variants for CYP2C19*2 or *3, which although higher was not statistically different from the East Sepik population (36 per cent). The results of this study indicated that other regional populations of PNG also have a relatively high incidence of the CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism compared with Caucasian populations. The high incidence reported in Vanuatu, however, may be due to genetic drift rather than a PNG founder population, as the Vanuatu population is dominated by the CYP2C19*2 allele, with a lower contribution from the *3 allelic variant.'\"], [\"'The Manus Basin in the eastern Bismarck Sea is a fastopening backarc basin behind the New Britain arc-trench system. Within the basin, motion between the Pacific and Bismarck plates about a pole located at 11\\\\xc2\\\\xb0 S, 145\\\\xc2\\\\xb0 E, occurs along three major leftlateral transform faults and a variety of extensional segments. We interpret SeaMARC II sidescan and other geophysical data to show that a Brunhes age plate reorganization created new extensional boundaries and a microplate between the NW-trending Willaumez, Djaul, and Weitin transforms. Two linked spreading segments formed in backarc basin crust between the Willaumez and Djaul transforms: the ESE-trending extensional transform zone (ETZ) in the west and the Manus spreading center (MSC) in the east. Positively magnetized crust on the MSC forms a wedge varying in width from 72 km at its southwest end to zero at its northeast tip, with corresponding Brunhes spreading rates varying from 92 mm/yr to zero. The MSC forms the northwestern boundary of the 100 km-scale Manus microplate and opens at 51\\\\xc2\\\\xb0/m.y. about a pole near its apex at 3\\\\xc2\\\\xb002\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xb2S, 150\\\\xc2\\\\xb032\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xb2E. Opposite the MSC, bordering the arc margin of New Britain, the microplate is bound by a zone of broadly distributed strike slip motion, extension, and volcanism. Within this area, the Southern Rifts contain a series of grabens partially floored by lava flows. Left-lateral motion between the Pacific and Bismarck plates appears to drive the counterclockwise pivoting motion of the Manus microplate and the complementary wedge-like opening of the MSC and the Southern Rifts. The pivoting motion of the microplate has resulted in compressional areas along its NE and SW boundaries with the Pacific and Bismarck plates respectively. East of the microplate, between the Djaul and Weitin transforms and within the arc margin of New Ireland, another zone of broad extension referred to as the Southeast Rifts takes up opening in a pull-apart basin. There, en echelon volcanic ridges may be the precursors of spreading segments, but erupted lavas include calcalkaline volcanics. Kinematic modeling and marine geophysical observations indicate that the responses to similar amounts of extension in the eastern Manus Basin have varied as a function of the different types of pre-existing crust: arc crust tectonically stretched over a broad area whereas backarc crust underwent relatively little stretching before accommodating extension by seafloor spreading.'\"], [\"'In Plasmodium falciparum, resistance to chloroquine (CQ) is conferred by a K to T mutation at amino acid position 76 (K76T) in the P. falciparum CQ transporter (PfCRT).

Apart from volcanogenic belts, there are widely occurring isolated local forms of volcanism (including deep-seated plume forms), which can be comparatively easily explained by the terrane concept. Contemporary notions of recent volcanism allow us to visualize our thoughts about paleovolcanological processes. However, one cannot gain deeper knowledge of recent volcanism, unless standing on the basis of the paleovolcanological foundation.

In addition, the presence of limited genetic diversity in the eastern episystem relative to that found in the north supports the presence of substantial, but not complete, barriers to gene flow between the northern and eastern Australian episystems.

Most village elders gave explanations of many of the phenomena in terms of spirits, spells, magic, religion, and personal experiences. Most school-aged students choose scientific explanations of natural phenomena in terms of what they had learned in school or from personal experiences.

Examples examined are the East African rifts and the New Zealand Plateau, S. W. Pacific. In the model continental lithosphere is stretched and rifted over thermally and chemically expanding asthenosphere blisters. Magmas, abundantly generated in the zone of partial melting at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, ascend and intrude into the fracturing crust. Upon cooling, these intrusives produce low amplitude magnetic anomalies. Sea-floor spreading begins when the asthenosphere finally breaks through en masse and it is thus only a late phase in a much longer cycle. Attenuated continental crust is often underlain by low velocity, low density, upper mantle, which is indicative of the blending of the crust and mantle. It is suggested that substantial parts of marginal quiet magnetic zones are continent-ocean transitions that formed by crustal attenuation. The attenuation model is used to explain the evolution of the Arctic region. It should help bridge the gap between fixists and mobilists.'\"], [\"'The colonization of Eurasia and Australasia by African modern humans has been explained, nearly unanimously, as the result of a quick southern coastal dispersal route through the Arabian Peninsula, the Indian subcontinent, and the Indochinese Peninsula, to reach Australia around 50 kya.

For thousands of years the nuts have been culturally important and a traditional food. Since the early 1990s there have been a number of projects aimed at the wider commercialization of the species, with mixed success. This review evaluates the biophysical and socio-economic literature and suggests how the domestication and commercialization processes could be taken forwards to improve the livelihoods of rural households in Melanesia. Many of the issues facing the domestication and commercialization of C. indicum nuts as an Agroforestry Tree Product (AFTP) are similar to those that will be important for the development of other AFTPs. Thus there are lessons that can be learnt from this species which make it a model for other agroforestry tree species.'\"], [\"' Scholarly views on the prehistory of the Pacific Islanders are currently undergoing a major shift in perspective and underlying assumptions. This shift is driven by new research data and a need for new theoretical perspectives on space, time, and causal process. A new research agenda is coming to the fore, replacing the agenda guiding Pacific studies since the 1950s. Instead of looking at these islands as remote, undeveloped human colonies scattered across a vast and empty expanse of sea, we are finding that the Pacific was a notably early sphere of human accomplishments, on land and sea, where the ocean was more an avenue than a barrier for cultural interchange. The roots of this new perspective can be traced back, in part, to the Wenner-Gren/Smithsonian conference on human biogeography held in Washington, D.C., in 1974.

Here the presence of the B3\\\\xce\\\\x9427 was surveyed among a total of 756 subjects from the indigenous populations inhabiting New Guinean islands and remote insular Southeast Asia by using a polymerase chain reaction method. In remote insular Southeast Asia where Austronesian-speaking peoples inhabit, the B3\\\\xce\\\\x9427 frequency ranged between 0.04 and 0.15. In New Guinea Island, hinterland or Papuan groups showed the absence of the B3\\\\xce\\\\x9427 or a very low gene frequency (0.01 in the Gidra) of the B3\\\\xce\\\\x9427.

Using fields standardized by global warming, it is seen that both CSIRO coupled models simulate larger surface warming in the tropical western Pacific Ocean, and smaller warming in the eastern Indian Ocean, than the CMIP3 average, and also model versions with a mixed-layer ocean. Corresponding differences in the changes in the pressure, winds, rainfall and other quantities were simulated. Introducing the coupled Mk3.5\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sea surface temperature field for the present climate, which has a warm bias, as the base climate for the MLO version had only a minor effect on the MLO version\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pattern of climate change. A Pacific-Indian Dipole index quantifying the amplitude of the warming pattern explains much of the variation in rainfall change simulated by the CMIP3 models over Australia and the Indonesian and Melanesian regions. It relates more strongly to Australian average rainfall than several other indices representing southern hemispheric circulation changes. The decline in Australian rainfall produced by the full ocean coupling is largest in summer, but occurs in each season, and extends across the continent.

The oldest traces of visitors are from the first century AD. Coastal settlements, with clear evidence of ties to the western Indian Ocean trading network, were established in several places over the next millennium. Important environmental changes of both plant and animal communities are documented over this period, including the extinctions of almost all large animal species. Urban life in Madagascar began with the establishment of the entrep\\\\xc3\\\\xb4t of Mahilaka on the northwest coast of the island in the twelfth century.

In this setting, the geodynamics of the Paleopacific plates exerted an effect only on the evolution of the outer (relative to the continent) ensimatic island arc, whereas the vast inner region between this arc and the continent evolved independently. As is seen from the character of the gravity field and seismic refractor velocity, the Kamchatka and Sea of Okhotsk continental blocks differ in the structure of the consolidated crust. These blocks collided with each other and the Asian continent in the middle Campanian (77 Ma ago). The extensive pre-Paleogene land that existed on the place of the present-day Sea of Okhotsk probably supplied the terrigenous material deposited since the late Campanian on the oceanic crust of the backarc basin to the south of the rise of inner continental blocks as the Khozgon, Lesnaya, and Ukelayat flysch complexes. The accretion of the Olyutor (Achaivayam) and Valagin segments of the ensimatic arc had different consequences due to the difference in thickness of the Earth\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s crust. The Valagin segment was formed on an older basement and had a much greater thickness of the crust than the Olyutor segment. As follows from computations and the results of physical modeling, the island arcs having crust more than 25 km in thickness collide with the continental margin and are thrust over the latter. In the case under consideration, the thrusting of the Valagin segment led to metamorphism of the underlying rocks. The crust of the Olyutor segment was much thinner. The contact of this segment with the continental margin resulted only in surficial accretion, which did not bring about metamorphism, and the underlying lithospheric plate continued to plunge into the subduction zone.'\"], [\"'The setting for this study was the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, an archipelago of 82 islands, located in the South Pacific Ocean.

We have investigated the capacity of six minisatellites to discriminate between four populations in Oceania.

We show also that the number of alleles, the allele distribution and the mutation rates at the Polynesian minisatellite loci do not deviate from those predicted by the neutral mutation/infinite allele model. The low gene diversity is therefore likely to be a result of the maintenance of small population sizes and bottleneck effects during the colonization of the Pacific.'\"], [\"'This first study of the whole genusAgathis makes use of recent local revisions of the New Caledonian and Australian species which are all maintained.

Herein, the unsupervised Bayesian clustering algorithms structure, is employed to analyse 377 autosomal short tandem repeats typed on 1,056 individuals from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain Human Diversity Panel. Individuals of known geographical origin were hierarchically classified into a framework of increasingly homogeneous clusters to serve as reference populations into which individuals of unknown ancestry can be assigned. The groupings were characterised by the geographical affinities of cluster members and the accuracy of these procedures was verified using several genetic indices. Fine-scale substructure was detectable beyond the broad population level classifications that previously have been explored in this dataset. Metrics indicated that within certain lines, the strongest structuring signals were detected at the leaves of the hierarchy where lineage-specific groupings were identified. The accuracy of unknown assignment was assessed at each level of the hierarchy using a 'leave one out' strategy in which each individual was stripped of cluster membership and then re-assigned using the supervised Bayesian clustering algorithm implemented in GeneClass2. Although most clusters at all levels of resolution experienced highly accurate assignment, a decline was observed in the finer levels due to the mixed membership characteristics of some individuals. The parameters defined by this study allowed for assignment of unknown individuals to genetically defined clusters with measured likelihood. Shared ancestry data can then be inferred for the unknown individual.\"], [\"'The gene PPARGC1A, in particular the Gly482Ser variant (rs8192678), had been proposed to be subject to natural selection, particularly in recent progenitors of extant Polynesian populations.

Understanding population structure using multiple datatypes can help untangle past dispersal events and reveal putative contemporary invasion pathways. The tephritid fruit fly, Zeugodacus cucurbitae (Coquillett), is a serious pest of cucurbits and other commercial crops and is considered native to the Indo-Oriental region, but is invasive in both Africa and the Pacific. Here, we combine molecular (microsatellites and COI) and morphological (male genetalia length and wing shape geometric morphometrics) data within an integrative taxonomic framework to test hypotheses concerning levels of Z. cucurbitae population variation observed in Southeast Asia (native range, 10 sites, ~200 individuals) versus the West Pacific (invasive range, 4 sites, ~80 individuals), and whether single or multiple introductions of Z. cucurbitae have occurred into the West Pacific. We also use this case to explicitly test if using an integrative approach provides more information about hypothesized invasion pathways than either genetic or morphological approaches would do alone. All datasets support Z. cucurbitae as being more variable in Southeast Asia than the West Pacific, and within these regions populations appear to be structured geographically. In particular, mainland and Sundaic Southeast Asian locations formed separate clusters, and New Guinea and Solomon Islands were not closely related to Guam and Hawaii. Evidence supports a separate single origin for New Guinea from the Melanesian arc, the Solomon Islands from Malaysia/Singapore, and Guam from mainland Asia, but multiple introductions into Hawaii from mainland Asia. Taken together, we argue that there is great value in integrating evidence from multiple sources as it can provide finer resolution of population relationships than any single data source alone.'\"], [\"'Communitarians have alleged a connection between according specialrights to community groupings and preserving the indigenous cultureand the social cohesion of the original community.

Their functional roles, however, over ecological and evolutionary times scales are not well known, in part because their numbers have been so drastically reduced. Ethnographic and archaeological data is analysed to assess long-term patterns of human\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93sea turtle interactions (mainly green and hawksbill) prior to western contact and the magnitude of turtle losses in this region. From the ethnographic data two large-scale patterns emerge, societies where turtle capture and consumption was controlled by chiefs and priests versus those where control over turtle was more flexible and consumption more egalitarian. Broadly the distinction is between societies on high (volcanic and raised coral) islands versus atolls, but the critical variables are the ratio of land to shallow marine environments, combined with the availability of refugia. Archaeological evidence further highlights differences in the rate and magnitude of turtle losses across these two island types, with high islands suffering both large and rapid declines while those on atolls are less marked. These long-term historical patterns help explain the ethnographic endpoints, with areas that experienced greater losses apparently developing more restrictive social controls over time. Finally, if current turtle migration patterns held in the past, with annual movements between western foraging grounds and eastern nesting beaches, then intensive harvesting from 2,800 Before Present in West Polynesia probably affected turtle abundance and coral reef ecology in East Polynesia well before the actual arrival of human settlers, the latter a process that most likely began 1,400\\\\xc2\\\\xa0years later.'\"], [\"'Control region polymorphisms in the mitochondrial DNA of 124 unrelated individuals from the Malay population living in or around Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia were investigated and phylogenetic haplogroup lineages were determined.

Sequence comparison of the control regions led to the identification of 117 mitochondrial haplotypes, in which 103 types were observed in only one individual and the other nine types were shared by more than two individuals. Gene diversity was estimated to be 0.997. Phylogenetic haplogroup determination revealed that the gene pool of the modern Malay population in Malaysia consisted mainly of southeast Asian, east Asian, unidentified and unique, and aboriginal southeast-specific haplogroups.

When Fiji was politically isolated it fostered secondary political friendships of olden days and established new ones. The paper searches for evidence of Fiji\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s agency to change the structure of its International Relations (IR) after the coup of 2000.

Ethnobotanical data were combined with AFLP analysis to elucidate possible sources of variation. Folk assessment of variation is based on: (a) morphological characteristics (11 characters), (b) names and (c) classification according to habitat, uses, origin and agronomic adaptation. This 3-fold approach allowed growers to differentiate 96 morphotypes, all of which are given distinct vernacular names. AFLP fingerprints successfully differentiated all these 96 morphotypes which do not present a significant intra-clonal variation. But genetic results showed no clear groupings according to geographic origin or habitat of morphotypes and stated that the diversity found within the village was comparable with the overall diversity found in Vanuatu. Local nomenclature and stories associated with each cultivar suggested three sources of diversity: introductions (38%), somatic mutations (15%) and sexual recombinations (48%). AFLP results confirm folk beliefs  about origin at least for three pairs of mutants. The 11 so-called wild forms analysed by AFLP were suggested to be feral, escapes from domestication.

Combining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), Y-chromosome and genome-wide data, we performed the most comprehensive analysis of the region to date, obtaining highly consistent results across all three systems and allowing us to reconcile the models. We infer a primarily common ancestry for Taiwan/ISEA populations established before the Neolithic, but also detected clear signals of two minor Late Holocene migrations, probably representing Neolithic input from both Mainland Southeast Asia and South China, via Taiwan. This latter may therefore have mediated the Austronesian language dispersal, implying small-scale migration and language shift rather than large-scale expansion.'\"], [\"'We conducted a survey for malaria diagnosis and treatment in four primary schools in Flores Island, one of the Indonesian Islands with an area of 17,000\\\\xc2\\\\xa0km2 and a population of 1.8 million.

The aim of this study is to present a new program\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94AncesTrees\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94developed for assessing ancestry based on metric analysis. AncesTrees relies on a machine learning ensemble algorithm, random forest, to classify the human skull. In the ensemble learning paradigm, several models are generated and co-jointly used to arrive at the final decision. The random forest algorithm creates ensembles of decision trees classifiers, a non-linear and non-parametric classification technique. The database used in AncesTrees is composed by 23 craniometric variables from 1,734 individuals, representative of six major ancestral groups and selected from the Howells\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 craniometric series. The program was tested in 128 adult crania from the following collections: the African slaves\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 skeletal collection of Valle da Gafaria; the Medical School Skull Collection and the Identified Skeletal Collection of 21st Century, both curated at the University of Coimbra. The first step of the test analysis was to perform ancestry estimation including all the ancestral groups of the database. The second stage of our test analysis was to conduct ancestry estimation including only the European and the African ancestral groups. In the first test analysis, 75\\\\xc2\\\\xa0% of the individuals of African ancestry and 79.2\\\\xc2\\\\xa0% of the individuals of European ancestry were correctly identified. The model involving only African and European ancestral groups had a better performance: 93.8\\\\xc2\\\\xa0% of all individuals were correctly classified.

Harcourt (1999) hypothesized that in insular Southeast Asia, slow lorises and tarsiers showed a checkerboard distribution on 12 small (<12,000\\\\xc2\\\\xa0km2) islands, i.e., only one or the other occurs, and attributed this to extreme levels of competition between these 2 largely faunivorous primates. Further, he predicted slow lorises were able to persist on smaller islands than tarsiers. We re-evaluated these findings using an expanded dataset including 49 islands where tarsiers or slow lorises occur. Tarsiers and slow lorises live on islands of similar size (median size of ca. 300\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93900\\\\xc2\\\\xa0km2), and both taxa inhabit an equal proportion of small, medium, and large islands. On small islands within their area of sympatry tarsiers occur on 1 island, slow lorises on 8, both genera on 3, and we can assume they have become extinct from 11 small islands since the Last Glacial Maximum. Sizes of islands where tarsiers or slow lorises have become extinct do not differ from islands where they are still extant. We show that slow lorises occur on more islands in insular Southeast Asia than perhaps previously assumed, but these islands are not smaller on average than islands where tarsiers occur. A checkerboard distribution between these taxa is not evident. More studies are needed at the macroecological level to assess the importance of biogeographic history in explaining their present-day distribution patterns.'\"], [\"'The literature of stone tool procurement and technology published in the past decade is reviewed in this article.

Yet services such as fisheries and coastal buffering are being degraded at an alarming rate, thus making people increasing vulnerable to protracted and sudden environmental changes. In the context of the occurrences of extreme events such as earthquakes and tsunamis, it is vital to uncover the processes that make people in these island states resilient, or not, to environmental disruptions. This paper compares people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s perceptions of social and environmental impacts after an extreme event in the Western Solomon Islands (11 different villages on 8 different islands) to better understand how knowledge systems influence the coupling of human and natural systems. We examine the factors that contributed to perceptions of respective recovery in the environmental versus the social domains across communities with different traditional governance and modernization characteristics in a tsunami impact gradient. First, we separately assessed, at the community and individual level, the potential determinants of perceived recovery in the environmental and social domains. At the community level, the average values of the perceived environmental and social recovery were calculated for each community (1\\\\xc2\\\\xa0year after the tsunami), and at the individual level, normally distributed environmental and social recovery variables (based on the difference in perceptions immediately and 1\\\\xc2\\\\xa0year after the tsunami) were used as dependent variables in two General Linear Models. Results suggest that environmental and social resilience are not always coupled correspondingly and, less unexpectedly, that asymmetries during recovery can occur as a result of the underlying social and ecological context and existing adaptive capacity. More generally, the study shows how by evaluating post-disturbance perceptional data in tsunami-affected communities, we can better understand how subjective perceptions of change can affect the (de)-coupling of human and natural systems.'\"], [\"'The supercontinental status of the contemporary aggregation of continents called North Pangea is substantiated. This supercontinent comprises all continents with the probable exception of Antarctica. In addition to the spatial contiguity of continents, the supercontinent is characterized by the prevalence of the continental crust that combines North America and Eurasia, Eurasia and Africa, and Eurasia and Australia. Over the course of the 300\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93250-Ma evolution from Wegener\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Pangea to contemporary North Pangea, the aggregation of continents has not lost its supercontinental status, despite modification of the supercontinent shape and opening and closure of the newly formed Paleotethys, Tethys, Atlantic, and Indian oceans. Over the last 250\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93300 Ma, all movements of the lithospheric plates have most likely occurred within the Indo-Atlantic segment of the Earth, whereas the Pacific segment has remained oceanic. In short, the formation of the North Pangea supercontinent can be outlined in the following terms. The long and deep subduction of the lithospheric plates beneath Eurasia and North America gave rise to the stabilization of the continents and accumulation of huge bodies of the cold lithosphere commensurable in volume with the upper mantle at the deeper mantle levels. This brought about compensation ascent of hot mantle (mantle plumes) near the convergent plate boundaries and far from them. A special geodynamic setting develops beneath the supercontinent. Due to encircling subduction of the lithospheric plates and related squeezing of the hot mantle, an ascending flow, or plume (superplume) formed beneath the central part of the supercontinent. In our view, the African superplume broke up Wegener\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Pangea in the Atlantic region, caused the opening of the Atlantic and Indian oceans, and migrated to the Arctic Region 53 Ma ago.'\"], [\"'It has been clearly established that the Portuguese introduced coconuts to the Cape Verde islands in 1499, and these supplied the Atlantic coasts and the Caribbean in the 1500s. By contrast, early 16th century reports of coconuts on the Pacific coast of Panama are controversial. Recent DNA analysis of modern coconut populations there shows them to be similar to Philippine varieties, agreeing with morphometric analysis. Hence, coconuts must have been brought by boat from the western Pacific, but no archaeological, ethnobotanical or linguistic evidence for pre-Columbian coconuts has been found. Thus, the most parsimonious explanation is that coconuts were introduced to Panama after Spanish conquest, as supported by DNA analysis and historical records of Spanish voyages. New collections along the Pacific coast, from Mexico to Colombia, are increasing the sampling for genetic analysis, and further work in the Philippines is suggested to test probable origins. Unless new archaeological discoveries prove otherwise, the strong hypothesis of Philippine origin should direct future research on the sources of American Pacific coast coconuts.'\"], [\"'Active spreading ridges in the North Fiji Basin range from well-developed stable ridges where largescale mantle upwelling is in progress to proto-ridges where spreading is incipient. South of 17\\\\xc2\\\\xb0S, where the central ridge of the North Fiji Basin has a bathymetric profile normally expected of a fast-spreading, steadystate mid-ocean ridge, basalts are evolved N-type MORBs. North of 17\\\\xc2\\\\xb0S, where the central ridge is propagating northward into old North Fiji Basin crust and spreading is in the initial stages, two types of basalt have been recovered: N-type MORBs from this northern arm of the central ridge are believed to be samples of older North Fiji Basin crust; basalts with transitional alkalic chemistry (up to 0.5% Ne in the Norm) and characterized by strong relative enrichments in Rb, Ba, K, Nb, La, Ce, Sr, P, Zr, and Ti are believed to be associated with incipient rifting. Among the latter group are compositions that are intermediate between transitional alkalic types and MORBs and these are geochemically similar to the back-arc basin (BABB) magma type defined by Sinton and Fryer (1987) from a study of Mariana back arc basin basalts. Dredges along the South Pandora Ridge, a transform zone characterized by short spreading segments, are dominated by basalts that are enriched in large-ion lithophile and high field strength minor and trace elements and compositions range from types resembling ocean island tholeiites to transitional alkalic varieties. Basalts from Rotuma are regarded as alkalic end-members of the South Pandora Ridge magmatic spectrum. In areas of the North Fiji Basin where relatively fast spreading must be accompanied by largescale asthenospheric upwelling, depleted (N-type) MORBs dominate, whereas in areas of slow mantle upwelling, or where some other tectonic effect (e.g. a transform fault) causes a transient thermal disturbance within the lithosphere or upper asthenosphere, enriched (alkalic) magmas either dominate or make a significant and noticeable contribution to the overall chemical characteristics of basalts being erupted. The MORBs have a depleted asthenospheric source, and the alkalic component is believed to derive from an enriched lithospheric or shallow asthenospheric source. The BABB magma type may simply be part of the spectrum of mixed magmas that can occur in the transitional tectonic settings represented by the early development of most back-arc basins.'\"], [\"'Tridacna gigas (L.) populations were sampled from 13 locations throughout the west Pacific in 1990\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x931991 and screened for allozyme variation at seven polymorphic loci.

The main routes of gene flow did not run parallel with known major surface currents as might be expected, but crossed them. Gene exchange was limited east-west between the Central and West Pacific groups and the GBR and the Solomon Islands. The lack of correspondence between the major surface currents and the routes of gene flow suggests that the genetic structure of T. gigas reflects historical patterns of migration that no longer occur, rather than presentday dispersal. These findings raise fundamental questions concerning the origin and maintenance of genetic diversity in Pacific faunas, and have important implications for the mariculture and conservation of T. gigas.'\"], [\"'Aoba is a basalt volcano situated in the northern part of a chain containing all the active volcanoes in the New Hebrides.

For the comparison, we used mooring data at 2,000\\\\xc2\\\\xa0m and below north and south of the equator obtained from preceding studies. In our model results, vertically propagating equatorial annual Rossby waves were detected in the velocity and pressure anomaly (P a) fields. P a had a multi-cell meridional structure symmetric about the equator. The corresponding meridional distribution of U, averaged along the wave propagation, was the same as that previously obtained from Argo float data, suggesting the existence of the multi-cell structure in P a in the real ocean. A harmonic analysis of the simulated U indicated that the equatorial annual Rossby waves excited over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific propagated down to below 2,000\\\\xc2\\\\xa0m in the western equatorial Pacific. Decomposition of the annual U harmonics indicated that the multi-cell structure in pressure was not a manifestation of a single meridional mode but a composite of several lowest meridional modes, suggesting that the cell widths may change according to relative mode intensities. The mooring data north and south of the equator was consistent with the simulated multi-cell structure in P a of the equatorial Rossby waves, although some discrepancies remained. We consider that the observed variation in U is a manifestation of the Rossby wave propagation in the real ocean.

Through their effects on the island environment, these hazards have a range of socio-economic impacts on food (fisheries and crops) and water supply, tourism, and coastal buildings and infrastructure.

These issues are particularly acute for the low-lying atoll countries whose continued existence is threatened by sea level rise, but also affect those that live on higher islands in coastal settlements, where most of their population is concentrated. Climate change thus sharpens social and cultural issues of equity (reflecting disparities in location, income, education, gender, health and age), made even more acute by increased levels of voluntary or forced migration within, and even more so beyond, island country boundaries. Consequently, many islanders see climate change as a moral challenge to the richer countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are causing the problem.'\"], [\"'Publications on archaeological remains of cultivated plants have been collected, mainly from 1998, with some earlier ones, and some from 1999, A list is given of the finds according to taxon, country, site, and age'\"], [\"''\"], [\"Ernst Mayr's scientific career continues strongly 70 years after he published his first scientific paper in 1923.

No systematic linkage disequilibrium was detected between most of the combinations, suggesting a lack of operation of any selection pressure at the two loci. The phylogenetic analysis confirmed the known interrelationships among various populations in the Asian-Pacific region. The Australian aborigines clustered closely with the non-Austronesian-speaking highlanders from Papua New Guinea, as expected. Similarly, the Austronesian-speaking Polynesians, Micronesians, and the Southeast Asians branched off together as a separate group. The position of the Austronesian-speaking Tolais from New Britain with respect to other populations from the Southwest Pacific was anomalous. The Tolais revealed a strong affinity with the Australian aborigines, which is inexplicable. The populations from China formed a tight cluster with other populations from the Asian-Pacific region.

Mongoloid populations can be characterized by four Gm haplotypes, Gm ag, axg, ab3st, and afb1b3, and can be divided into two groups based on the analysis of genetic distances utilizing Gm haplotype frequency distributions: the first is a southern group characterized by a remarkably high frequency of Gm afb1b3 and a low frequency of Gm ag, and the second, a northern group characterized by a high frequency of both Gm ag and Gm ab3st but an extremely low frequency of Gm afb1b3. 2. Populations in China, mainly Han but including minority nationalities, show remarkable heterogeneity of Gm allotypes from north to south and contrast sharply to Korean and Japanese populations, which are considerably more homogenous with respect to these genetic markers. The center of dispersion of the Gm afb1b3 gene characterizing southern Mongoloids has been identified as the Guangxi and Yunnan area in the southwest of China. 3. The Gm ab3st gene, which is found with its the highest incidence among the northern Baikal Buriats, flows in all directions. However, this gene shows a precipitous drop from mainland China to Taiwan and Southeast Asia and from North to South America, although it is still found in high frequency among Eskimos, Koryaks, Yakuts, Tibetans, Olunchuns, Tungus, Koreans, Japanese, and Ainus. On the other hand, the gene was introduced into Huis, Uyghurs, Indians, Iranians, and spread as far as to include Hungarians and Sardinians in Italy.

In addition, the linear correlations between mooring data and altimetry products indicate that the variations in surface meridional currents along the western boundary of the Pacific Ocean can reach the bottom via low-frequency processes. The vertical-mode decomposition for observations indicates that the first four modes can effectively capture the original data.

This tribe includes about 1900 species (almost 3000 species-group names) from 47 genera; about one third of the genera (15) are monotypic. The generic diversity of Eupitheciini is the highest in the Australian (38 genera, 11 of them endemic) and Oriental regions (32 genera, 4 endemic) and the lowest in the Neotropical Region (possibly one genus only). The faunas of different biogeographic regions can be arranged in following order by their species richness: the Palaearctic (487 species), Oriental (397), Neotropical (346), Australian (251), Afrotropical (198), and Nearctic Regions (166 species). Eupithecia is the most species-rich genus in the family Geometridae and the entire order Lepidoptera, and one of the largest genera in the whole World fauna of insects. The greatest number of species of this genus is recorded in the Palaearctic Region (466 species), where Eupithecia accounts for about 95% of the tribe Eupitheciini. The mainland of the Oriental Region (especially the Himalayas) is also very species-rich; however the proportion of the Eupithecia representatives decreases towards Malaysia, Sundaland, and the Australian Region (about 2% of the tribe). The Eupitheciini faunas have the greatest similarity at the generic level between the Oriental and Australian Regions (the Jaccard and S\\\\xc3\\\\xb8rensen coefficient values being 0.62 and 0.77, respectively). The Palaearctic fauna is more similar to the Afrotropical and Oriental faunas at the genus-group level. On the whole, the fauna of the Nearctic Region is similar to that the West Palaearctic, with the exception of the fact that representatives of the genera Gymnoscelis and Chloroclystis are absent in North America, although two endemic genera Nasusina and Prorella are present. At the genus-group level, the Nearctic fauna of Eupitheciini is more similar to the Neotropical (the Jaccard and S\\\\xc3\\\\xb8rensen coefficients 0.20 and 0.33, respectively) than to the Palaearctic fauna (0.17 and 0.29). The number of synonymies is very high in the tribe Eupitheciini because of the homogeneity of this group, whose species are difficult to identify without the use of elaborate anatomical techniques. Modern revisions, catalogues, surveys, and atlases on Eupitheciini are absent for many countries and large geographic regions. Revisions of pugs of the tribe Eupitheciini for some biogeographic regions are extremely difficult because of fragmentation of entomological collections including the type specimens of many species-group taxa. A large fraction of synonyms is characteristic of parts of the World with the best known faunas: Europe (64% of synonyms) and North America (39%).

The two cones are immediately adjacent to each other and have partly coalesced. This close proximity, their similarity of form, and their positions over the same depths (70\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93160 km) to the New Britain Benioff zone, could be indications that Bamus and Ulawun have had related, or at least similar, eruptive histories. But there are important differences between the two volcanoes. Bamus is thought to have last erupted some time between 1878 and 1894, whereas Ulawun has erupted at least 17 times since the late nineteenth century. In addition, the rocks of Bamus are distinctly different from those of Ulawun. Mafic rocks are found in the older part of Bamus (including a boninite-like, or magnesian-andesite, lava flow), and the younger rocks of Bamus are low-MgO andesites (the most recent products have the highest SiO2 contents of all the analysed rock samples). In contrast, Ulawun appears to be a uniform pile of basalts and some andesites that have consistently lower amounts of CaO and Zr compared to Bamus rocks. Ulawun basalts are unlikely to represent the parental magmas from which Bamus andesites were derived by simple crystal fractionation, judging by the results of least-squares mixing calculations and the relatively high Zr contents of the Bamus andesites. The magmatic histories of Bamus and Ulawun appear to be unrelated, but because both volcanoes are the highest of all volcanoes in the Bismarck volcanic arc, both may now be susceptible to large-scale gravitational slumping or cauldron subsidence. North- and east-trending lineaments and escarpments on both volcanoes may represent the tectonically controlled scars of former gravitational collapses.

The historical roots of these ideas reach far back to the early 1920s, when the 19-year-old student suggested to his mentor, Dr. Erwin Stresemann (Berlin), the development for birds of a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ctheory of geographical variation and of the species.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d During the 1930s, Mayr himself assembled data for a comprehensive analysis of geographical variation and speciation in birds, when he studied the rich collections of the Whitney South Sea Expedition from the islands in the Pacific Ocean. He described from this and other regions 27 new species and 445 new subspecies of birds, more than any other living ornithologist. He established the basic principles of island biogeography, discussed critically the former existence of landbridges and emphasized that, in zoogeographical studies, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cinstead of fixed regions, it is necessary to think of fluid faunas.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d His theoretical framework included active jump dispersal of birds and other animals as well as various types of vicariance processes which had an effect on faunal differentiation. Although Mayr was not the originator of the biological species concept, he demonstrated its validity more convincingly than anyone else before and proposed a superior and concise definition of the biospecies which everybody adopted. He also initiated with various studies a period of renewed interest in the macrosystematics of birds.'\"], [\"'During the Early Cretaceous, ocean-floor spreading gradually opened up the tropical Atlantic and the Indian Ocean basin widened as the eastern segments of Gondwanaland were conveyed farther apart. At the same time, epeiric seas were advancing on all continents, reaching maximum extent during the Cenomanian. The resultant trend to widespread, more equable climate favored the invasion into the lowlands of angiosperms whose postulated origin was in mild uplands at low latitudes during pre-Cretaceous times. As tropical and subtropical lands were rafted farther apart by ocean-floor spreading following Albian-Cenomanian times, new taxa (species, genera, tribes, families) evolved in isolation. This accounts in part for the increasing richness of the three major tropical floras following the Cretaceous. Changes in Mesozoic paleogeography also appear to clarify several other puzzling aspects of early angiosperm history and distribution, including their early appearance at middle latitudes.'\"], [\"'During the last three years, the North Fiji Basin (SW Pacific) has been intensively studied on three oceanographic cruises carried out by French, American and Japanese ships. One of the main goals of these cruises was to study by means of precise SeaBeam, SEAMARC II, seismic and magnetic surveys, the active spreading system and its associated hydrothermal processes. The North Fiji basin, bounded by the major Pacific and Indo-Australian plates, shows a complex polyphased tectonic evolution. One of the last phases of this evolution is the functioning since 3 Ma of a NS spreading center in the axial part of the basin. The tectonic instability of the area resulted in a permanent rearrangement of the ridge axis. Among others, the 16\\\\xc2\\\\xb040\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xb2 S triple junction is one of the major manifestations of such an instability. Sinistral strike-slip motion 1 Ma ago, along the North Fiji Fracture Zone induced the change in direction of two segments of the axis from NS to N15 and N160. The first segment is characterized by a typical spreading ridge similar to various parts of the EPR, while the second shows an atypical \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98en echelon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fan-shape opening. The N15 and N160 ridges converging with the North Fiji Fracture Zone constitute the 16\\\\xc2\\\\xb040\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xb2 S Ridge-Ridge-Fracture Zone triple junction. The detailed morphologic and kinematic study of this junction allows us to understand one of the mechanisms of the deformation in the North Fiji basin.'\"], [\"'\\\\nMarkov chains provide us with a powerful tool for studying the structure of graphs and databases in details.

Divergence times in the family have previously been estimated using non-parametric rate smoothing (NPRS) and penalized likelihood (PL). Here we use an uncorrelated lognormal (UCLD) relaxed molecular clock in BEAST to estimate diversification times of the main clades within the family with a focus on the Asian genus Pseuduvaria within the SBC. Two fossil calibration points are applied, including the first use of the recently discovered Annonaceae fossil Futabanthus. The taxonomy and morphology of Pseuduvaria have been well documented, although no previous dating or biogeographical studies have been undertaken. Ancestral areas at internal nodes within Pseuduvaria are determined using dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA) and weighted ancestral area analysis (WAAA).\"], [\"'The genusFagraea comprises a diverse group of woody gentians that are renowned for having hard wood and fragrant, showy flowers.

To do this, we identified different types of lithic production and exchange during the late pre-colonial period at three coastal sites around Madang in northeast New Guinea. The study is the first major technological and sourcing study in this area. Consistent with terrestrial models, lithic technological analysis crucially shows that groups with higher levels of coastal mobility (1) were reducing a wider range of lithic materials and (2) reduced material less intensively than groups with indirect access. Conversely, groups with lower coastal mobility levels (1) were flaking a restricted range of lithic materials and (2) reduced material more intensively. Geochemical analysis, using X-ray fluorescence, shows that at all three sites obsidian artefacts exclusively derived from Kutau/Bao (Talasea) in West New Britain. This indicates that, by about 600\\\\xc2\\\\xa0years ago through to the late nineteenth century, the Kutau/Bao source had become a specialised export product, being fed into major distribution conduits operational along the northeast coast. Importantly, there is no evidence for exchange with other sources such as Admiralties or Fergusson Island obsidian. This is contrastive to the Sepik coast, where obsidian from the Admiralties Islands featured prominently alongside West New Britain obsidian, and suggests the emergence of different coastal supply lines feeding the northeast Madang coast and the north Sepik coast.'\"], [\"'This paper discusses the origins of Oryza sativa japonica rice cultivation in the Yangzi region of China and asks how and with which migrating human populations it spread south to reach Taiwan by 3,000 BC and Southeast Asia by 2,000 BC.

Environmental barriers also played major roles in establishing a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cpause, adapt, spread, pause again\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d mode of movement, such barriers relating to availability of rainfall and alluvial land, latitude (photoperiodism) and climatic seasonality, and the prior presences of other populations, in some cases with vegetative gardening systems that did not involve rice or other cereals.

LVG and KVG lavas are mostly medium-K tholeiitic rocks with high LILE/HFSE ratios characteristic of islands ares, while MVG lavas are ne-normative alkalic rocks with high LILE and HFSE, characteristic of ocean island basalts. LVG lavas have high \\\\xc9\\\\x9bNd (+8.0\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93+8.4) and low 87Sr/86Sr (0.70273\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x930.70349) similar to N-MORB, whereas KVG lavas have slightly more radiogenic values (\\\\xc9\\\\x9bNd=+7.5\\\\xe2\\\\x88\\\\x92+8.4; 87Sr/86Sr=0.70323-0.70397). MVG lavas form an isotopically distinct group having lower \\\\xc9\\\\x9bNd (+4.6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93+4.9) and (87Sr/86Sr ranging from 0.70347\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x930.70375). LVG lavas were erupted in a primary oceanic island arc (Vitiaz arc) during the Miocene. Basaltic lavas were derived by approximately 19% partial melting of mantle wedge peridotite with only minor subduction component. Andesites and dacites were produced by low-pressure plagioclase-pyroxene-titanomagnetite dominated crystal fractionation. KVG lavas were erupted during the period immediately prior to or during the initial stages of rifting in the Lau Basin, and, like LVG lavas, show significant chemical differences at the northern and southern ends of the Lau Ridge. Lavas at the northern end (type (ii)) appear to be derived from a more depleted source than LVG but with a greater amount of subduction component. Those at the southern end (type (i)) probably came from a slightly more enriched source with less subduction component. MVG basalts and hawaiites were derived from an enriched mantle with little or no subduction input. The hawaiites (type (i)) could not have been derived from the basalts (type (ii)), and the two magma types must have come from different sources, indicating mantle heterogeneity. The lack of subduction influence indicates the MVG lavas are tectonically unrelated to the present-day Tonga arc, and the lack of depletion indicators suggests they have tapped a different (new?) part of the mantle wedge. This may reflect introduction of sub-Pacific mantle through the present Tonga-Lau subduction system.'\"], [\"'There has been a long-standing debate concerning the extent to which the spread of Neolithic ceramics and Malay-Polynesian languages in Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) were coupled to an agriculturally driven demic dispersal out of Taiwan 4000\\\\xc2\\\\xa0years ago (4\\\\xc2\\\\xa0ka). We previously addressed this question using founder analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control-region sequences to identify major lineage clusters most likely to have dispersed from Taiwan into ISEA, proposing that the dispersal had a relatively minor impact on the extant genetic structure of ISEA, and that the role of agriculture in the expansion of the Austronesian languages was therefore likely to have been correspondingly minor. Here we test these conclusions by sequencing whole mtDNAs from across Taiwan and ISEA, using their higher chronological precision to resolve the overall proportion that participated in the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cout-of-Taiwan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d mid-Holocene dispersal as opposed to earlier, postglacial expansions in the Early Holocene. We show that, in total, about 20\\\\xc2\\\\xa0% of mtDNA lineages in the modern ISEA pool result from the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cout-of-Taiwan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d dispersal, with most of the remainder signifying earlier processes, mainly due to sea-level rises after the Last Glacial Maximum. Notably, we show that every one of these founder clusters previously entered Taiwan from China, 6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x937\\\\xc2\\\\xa0ka, where rice-farming originated, and remained distinct from the indigenous Taiwanese population until after the subsequent dispersal into ISEA.'\"], [\"'In 1925, J.D. Tothill and two colleagues set out to manage Levuana iridescens, the coconut moth of Fiji, using biological control. By 1930, they had succeeded so completely that this pest of the copra crop had been reduced to almost undetectable levels by the tachinid fly, Bessa remota, introduced from Malaya, and they had summarized their campaign in a thoroughly documented and well-illustrated monograph. The example of the coconut moth is presented in the modern literature as the first and best documented extinction of a species due to scientific biological control. The program has been severely criticized because the moth was unique, beautiful, and considered endemic to Fiji. Thus, this program is also portrayed as an example of the highly controversial practice of neoclassical biological control. However, a careful reexamination of this event discloses that the moth was likely not native to Fiji, appeared to be spreading through the Fijian Archipelago, and might have spread to other island groups in the South Pacific. Also, L. iridescens is probably not extinct. Collateral damage, that is, non-target impacts, did occur as native zygaenid moths have been attacked by the tachinid, and they may be extinct. The reasons for the control campaign of L. iridescens were not primarily economic. Tothill and colleagues were trying to protect copra so that ethnic Fijian culture, so dependent on the coconut palm threatened by L. iridescens, could be sustained. Hence, this control program represents a difficult clash of values: preservation of insect biodiversity versus preservation of indigenous Pacific Islander cultures. A strategy to search for L. iridescens populations is proposed and development of biological control of B. remota, using hyperparasitoids, is possible, but would require careful evaluation since it might release L. iridescens from suppression, have non-target impacts on native tachinids, and lack an economic motivation.'\"], [\"'The manufacture of edible starch products from sago palms of the genus Metroxylon is common to indigenous people throughout Melanesia but is unknown in Polynesia, even in areas where Metroxylon species occur. We here report the use of Metroxylon as a starch source in the isolated Polynesian island of Rotuma. In Rotuma, Metroxylon warburgii (Heim) Beccari grows wild, but is likely the result of an aboriginal introduction from Melanesia. Samoan ethnohistorical accounts indicate that Metroxylon warburgii was introduced to Samoa from Rotuma. Rotuman manufacture of starch from M. warburgii appears to date from pre-European times as indicated by written accounts of early visitors to Rotuma and Rotuman oral histories. We provide details of the process of starch manufacture in Rotuma and speculate on possible means by which this technology was transferred from Melanesia to Rotuma.'\"], [\"'The main differences and similarities between the tectonic features of the Urals and the Tien Shan are considered. In the Neoproterozoic and Early and Middle Paleozoic, the Ural and Turkestan oceanic basins were parts of one oceanic domain, with several distinct regions in which tectonic events took different courses. The Baltic continental margin of the Ural paleoocean was active, whereas the Tarim-Alay margin of the Turkestan ocean, similar in position, was passive. The opposite continental margin in the Urals is known beginning from the Devonian as the Kazakh-Kyrgyz paleocontinent. In the Tien Shan, a similar margin developed until the Late Ordovician as the Syr Darya block with the ancient continental crust. In the Silurian, this block became a part of the Kazakh-Kyrgyz paleocontinent. The internal structures of the Ural and Turkestan paleooceans were different. The East Ural microcontinent occurred in the Ural paleoocean during the Early and Middle Paleozoic. No microcontinents are established in the Turkestan oceanic basin. Volcanic arcs in the Ural paleoocean were formed in the Vendian (Ediacarian), at the Ordovician-Silurian boundary, and in the Devonian largely along the Baltic margin at different distances from its edge. In the Turkestan paleoocean, a volcanic arc probably existed in the Ordovician at its Syr Darya margin, i.e., on the other side of the ocean in comparison with the Urals. The subduction of the Turkestan oceanic crust developed with interruptions always in the same direction. The evolution of subduction in the Urals was more complicated. The island arc-continent collision occurred here in the Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous; the continent-continent collision took place in the Moscovian simultaneously with the same process in the Tien Shan. The deepwater flysch basins induced by collision appeared at the Baltic margin in the Famennian and Visean, whereas in the Bashkirian and Moscovian they appeared at the Alay-Tarim margin. In the Devonian and Early Carboniferous, the Ural and Turkestan paleooceans had a common active margin along the Kazakh-Kyrgyz paleocontinent. The sudduction of the oceanic crust beneath this paleocontinent in both the Urals and the Tien Shan started, recommenced after interruptions, and finally ceased synchronously. In the South Ural segment, the Early Carboniferous subduction developed beneath both Baltica and the Kazakh-Kyrgyz paleocontinent, whereas in the Tien Shan, it occurred only beneath the latter paleocontinent. A divergent nappe-fold orogen was formed in the Urals as a result of collision of the Kazakh-Kyrgyz paleocontinent with the Baltic and Alay-Tarim paleocontinents, whereas a unilateral nappe-fold orogen arose in the Tien Shan. The growth of the high divergent orogen brought about the appearance of the Ural Foredeep filled with molasse beginning from the Kungurian. In the Tien Shan, a similar foredeep was not developed; a granitic axis similar to the main granitic axis in the Urals was not formed in the Tien Shan either.'\"], [\"'Extralimital traits\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94evolutionary innovations that represent unprecedented departures from the phenotypic norm in the clade in which they arise\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94are often thought preferentially to evolve in island-like settings, but accumulating evidence indicates that they also arise in highly diverse, competitively rigorous ecosystems. In order to evaluate the origins of extralimital traits, I reconstructed the history of all ecological and shell-morphological innovations in Miocene to Recent shallow-water molluscs from the two great modern tropical marine realms, the Indo-West Pacific (IWP) and Atlantic-eastern Pacific (AEP), with the expectation that the more diverse IWP would show a higher incidence of innovation. Of the 66 innovations I identified, 53 (80%) are IWP and 13 (20%) are AEP in origin. Data on the numbers of living species in 26 molluscan clades in the two tropical realms indicate that the species ratio (AEP to total number of species 0.32\\\\xc2\\\\xa0\\\\xc2\\\\xb1\\\\xc2\\\\xa00.115) exceeds the innovation ratio (AEP to total innovations 0.21). The per-species frequency of innovation is therefore significantly higher in the IWP. None of the innovations is unique to endemic taxa on oceanic islands. I suggest that warm, large, highly productive environments are more conducive to the establishment of new ecological roles and phenotypic states than are smaller, less productive, more island-like settings; and that diversity need not be correlated with either high productivity or evolutionary opportunity for innovation.'\"], ['Abstract not available'], [\"' Grab samples from the submarine Conical Seamount, located about 10\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89km south of the giant Ladolam gold deposit, Lihir Island, reveal the highest gold concentrations yet reported from the modern seafloor.

The primitive character of the rocks from Conical Seamount implies a magmatic evolution related to a single eruptive phase, which contrasts with the more evolved rocks forming Lihir Island. Geochemical as well as mineral chemical data suggest that the melts from both Conical Seamount and Lihir Island originate from the same magma source.

Four successive studies were conducted with emphasis on the genetic relationship within D. alata and among species of the Enantiophyllum section from Vanuatu. Study 1 was carried out to select a set of polymorphic primer pairs using 11 combinations and eight species belonging to five distinct sections. The four most polymorphic primer pairs were used in study 2 among six species of the Enantiophyllum section. Study 3 focussed mainly on the genetic relationship among 83 accessions of D. alata, mostly from Vanuatu (78 acc.) but also from Benin, Guadeloupe, New Caledonia and Vietnam. The ploidy level of 53 accessions was determined and results indicated the presence of tetraploid, hexaploid and octoploid cultivars. Study 4, included 35 accessions of D. alata, D. nummularia and D. transversa and was conducted using two primer pairs to verify the taxonomical identity of the cultivars `langlang', `maro' and `netsar' from Vanuatu. The overall results indicated that each accession can be fingerprinted uniquely with AFLP. D. alata is an heterogeneous species which shares a common genetic background with D. nummularia and `langlang', `maro' and `netsar'. UPGMA cluster analysis revealed the existence of three major groups of genotypes within D. alata, each assembling accessions from distant geographical origins and different ploidy levels. The analysis also revealed that `langlang', `maro' and `netsar' clustered together with the cultivar `wael' (D. transversa) from New Caledonia.

Made from a raw material valued by cultures throughout the world and imbued with water, life, health, and fertility symbolism, shell objects have functioned as prestige goods. Shell prestige goods circulated between individuals, groups, and societies and materialized interpersonal relationships, making them valuable for archaeologists shifting focus from objects to the people in past societies. Shell ornaments had multiple roles, including ornamentation, wealth, marking status, and as ritual paraphernalia, and had varying symbolic associations even within a society. The rich ethnographic literature on shell use provides a source for archaeological model building. Marine shell artifacts often moved between societies and across long distances, offering a way for archaeologists to explore regional relationships and the interactions between ancient societies.

At the opposite end of the Pacific Ocean, on the south-east coast of Australia, multiple reflections, scatterings and alternate pathways lead to a prolonged and complicated response. This response was largely unaltered in crossing the continental shelf but was then transformed by bay resonances and admittances. These effects are described using data from tide recorders sparsely spread over 1,000\\\\xc2\\\\xa0km of the coast. Some new adaptations and applications of time-series analysis are applied to separate tsunami waves that have followed different pathways but contain the same spectral components.

This is attributed to unfavourable conditions in the connecting area associated with the long established northern Australian Monsoon Climate. This would be expected to have impacted strongly on freshwater faunas with the following results: (1) limited overlap in species, (2) most higher taxonomic groups present in both areas sharing no species or even genera and (3) shared species dominated by lentic species with high dispersal capacity. Testing these predictions for dragonflies showed the turnover in the family, genus and species composition between Australia and New Guinea to be higher than anywhere in the world with only 50% of families and subfamilies, 33% of the genera and 8% of the species being shared. Only one of the 53 shared species favors lotic waters compared with 64% of the 652 combined Australian\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93New Guinean species.

Using the IEF technique, approximately 50,000 individuals from 160 different populations have been tested for the GC polymorphism. A marked variation in common GC suballele frequencies in different geographic areas seems to correlate with skin pigmentation and intensity of sun light. Pigmented (black) and keratinized (yellowish) skin type populations have a relatively high frequency of the GC*IF allele as compared to white skin populations. By comparison non-pigmented and non-keratinized white skin populations are generally characterized by having the maximum values of the GC*IS allele. The anthropologic significance of the GC locus has been enhanced further by detecting additional unique GC variants which provide useful information about evolutionary links between different populations.

Each flower secretes abundant nectar (125\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93184 \\\\xce\\\\xb5l) with low sugar concentration (15\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9318% sucrose-equivalents, weight per weight basis) which is available at anthesis just before dawn. Ninety percent of flower visits occur between anthesis and mid-morning. The honeyeaters perch on inflorescence bracts, and probing of the flower results in pollen deposition on the head and bill from where pollen is transferred between flowers. No statements on compatibility can be made forHeliconia paka; however,Heliconia laufao appears to be self-compatible. Calculations of energetic values of nectar of the Polynesian heliconias and Daily Energy Expenditures ofF. carunculata suggest that populations ofH. laufao andH. paka serve as rich energy resources for their pollinators.'\"], [\"'This paper compares the socio-spatial characteristics of two missions dating from different periods in Torres Strait, northeastern Australia. It builds upon previous archaeological research which correlates settlement-subsistence systems with the seascape cosmologies of marine specialists. Against the backdrop of profound changes in colonial governance and religious commitment (from mission to church) from the late nineteenth to mid twentieth centuries, we map the changing structure of two Torres Strait missions, and reflect upon these changes relative to lived sea-space.

The polymorphism exists at two levels. At the higher level there is an imperfect tandem repeat of 48 base pairs (bp) coding for 16 amino acids; alleles have been identified with 2 (32 amino acids) to 10 (160 amino acids) repeats. The imperfect nature of the repeats is responsible for a more subtle level of variation since alleles with the same number of repeats can differ in the exact sequences or in the order of the variants of the 48-bp unit. We have undertaken a global survey of this expressed polymorphism as one approach to understanding the evolutionary significance and origins of the polymorphism as well as understanding what selective forces, if any, may be operating at this locus. As the first step, we have determined the repeat number genotype of the DRD4 repeat polymorphism in 1,327 individuals from 36 different populations. The allele frequencies differ considerably among the different populations. The 4-repeat allele was the most prevalent (global mean allele frequency = 64.3%) and appeared in every population with a frequency ranging from 0.16 to 0.96. The 7-repeat allele was the second most common (global mean = 20.6%), appearing quite frequently in the Americas (mean frequency = 48.3%) but only occasionally in East and South Asia (mean frequency = 1.9%). The 2-repeat allele was the third most common (global mean frequency = 8.2%) and was quite frequent in East and South Asia (mean frequency = 18.1%) while uncommon in the Americas (mean frequency = 2.9%) and Africa (mean frequency = 1.7%). The universality of the polymorphism with only three common repeat-number alleles (4, 7, and 2) indicates that the polymorphism is ancient and arose before the global dispersion of modern humans. The diversity of actual allele frequencies for this expressed polymorphism among different populations emphasizes the importance of population considerations in the design and interpretation of any association studies carried out with this polymorphism.'\"], [\"'An analysis of human population trends from 2000 to 2010 shows that of the roughly one billion additional people on the planet today, a disproportionate number live in the biodiversity hotspots and tropical wilderness areas (TWAs). Although the annual population growth rate in the hotspots declined from 1.6 to 1.3\\\\xc2\\\\xa0%, the total population increased by 187 million people. While less densely populated, the TWAs grew at roughly twice the rate of the hotspots. Overall, slower growth rates are indicative of longer-term global trends in decreasing fertility, aging populations, and increased urbanization. The hotspots, however, are largely inhabited by people who have yet to enter their reproductive years or are in the early stages therein. The young age structure means that populations in these priority conservation areas will grow even as fertility rates fall further, and biodiversity will be forced to share dwindling natural habitat with ever more people.'\"], [\"'The second part of the review of the subgenus Hirundichthys s.str. dealt with two nerito-oceanic species of the subgenus which have weakly pronounced \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cmirror\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d on the pectoral fins: H. oxycephalus and H. affinis. The validity of H. coromandelensis (Hornell, 1923) as a subspecies of H. oxycephalus is restored. A comparison of local populations showed that H. oxycephalus is a polytypic species and forms three subspecies: nominative H. oxycephalus oxycephalus from the Western Pacific and Eastern Indian Ocean, H. oxycephalus coromandelensis from the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and adjoining waters of the Indian Ocean, and known by the only specimen from the waters of New Guinea H. oxycephalus frereensis ssp.n.

However, in the present study, the few data available on women's fishing in Oceania are examined, and these show that women contribute significantly to marine food yields in the region. Also, it is suggested that the highly regular nature of women's fishing makes women more reliable, and therefore more effective than men as suppliers of protein for subsistence. The implications of these findings for future development policies in the region are then discussed.\"], [\"'From a mtDNA dominant perspective, the exit from Africa of modern humans to colonize Eurasia occurred once, around 60 kya, following a southern coastal route across Arabia and India to reach Australia short after. These pioneers carried with them the currently dominant Eurasian lineages M and N.

We counter in this essay with a well-documented suite of politically complex hunter-gatherer (CHG) societies that exhibit these same features, thereby demonstrating that reliance on agriculture per se\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94or any other specific food regime such as fishing\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94should be excised from explanations of emergent political complexity. Despite the failure of the agricentric model to account for a significant number of cases of institutionalized complexity, some of its architects remain entrenched in their disbelief and rigidly ignore the implications of CHG studies. By continuing to situate farming as foundational to everything complex, they perpetuate not only a story of human cultural evolution\\\\xc2\\\\xa0over the last 10,000\\\\xc2\\\\xa0years that is incomplete but also a narrative that is incorrect. We reject subsistence (domesticates) as the central organizing principle and introduce here a new forum for thinking about how societies operate and evolve. We propose a model consisting of integrated platforms of societal dynamics that are inclusive (encourage discourse of all societies), nonprogressive, and serve as an organizational structure to discuss cultural evolution in any comparative or singular ethnographic context. The platforms are nonhierarchical and not fixed in order or importance. They are (1) agency and authority, (2) social differentiation, (3) participation in communal events, (4) organization of production, (5) labor obligations, (6) articulation of ecology and subsistence, and (7) territoriality and ownership. All sociopolitical cases and all topics can be productively discussed on these platforms, from bands to the largest empires, comparatively or diachronically. In the present article, we use the platforms to examine political evolution. We assemble considerable evidence that a variety of dietary regimes are associated with the emergence of institutionalized political complexity. Rather than diet,\\\\xc2\\\\xa0it is the ways people integrate and use labor\\\\xc2\\\\xa0that demands our attention.'\"], ['Abstract not available'], [\"'The sclerophyll forests which once extended over the lowlands of the west coast of New Caledonia are now reduced to small fragments representing about 2% (10 000 ha) of their original area. Much of the remaining forests are degraded. Threats to sclerophyll forests come from land clearance, grazing by cattle or deer, and fire. In sclerophyll forests, 223 endemic phanerogam species occur and 59 of these are specific to this forest type. Several of the 59 specific species are known only from a few plants at a single locality and are critically endangered. Pittosporum tanianum sp. nov. became extinct shortly after its discovery in 1988, and becomes the first documented plant extinction in New Caledonia. A further 15 species of New Caledonian plants, not recorded for several decades, are discussed, and it is concluded that between 4 and 9 of them may be extinct. The existing reserves containing sclerophyll forests are inadequate to protect the remaining biodiversity of the forests. Four immediate steps needed to protect sclerophyll forests are (i) restoration of Lepr\\\\xc3\\\\xa9dour Island; (ii) purchase and restoration of selected privately owned forests; (iii) management of publicly owned forest near N\\\\xc3\\\\xa9poui; and (iv) ex situ conservation of certain species.'\"], [\"'Knowledge of New Caledonian palms (Arecaceae) has increased dramatically during the past few years with a wealth of new morphological, anatomical, ecological and molecular data now available. This information makes necessary several changes in the definition of New Caledonian endemic genera. In this article, we present a synopsis of all palm genera of New Caledonia and the subtribes to which they belong, keys for their identification, and a checklist of the species with new combinations where necessary. We retain nine genera of Areceae instead of the 15 previously recognised. The monotypic genera Alloschmidia, Campecarpus, Moratia, Lavoixia and Veillonia, and the bispecific genus Brongniartikentia, are reduced into synonymy with other genera. We provide a description and discussion of the correspondingly enlarged genera Basselinia, Cyphophoenix, Cyphokentia and Clinosperma, as well as notes on the four subtribes now recognised on the island: Livistoninae, Archontophoenicinae, Clinospermatinae and Basseliniinae. In addition, we formally incorporate the monotypic genus Lepidorrhachis from Lord Howe Island within the Basseliniinae. As a result of the changes made here at the generic and specific levels, the family Arecaceae in New Caledonia now comprises 10 genera and 38 species. Five new combinations are made.'\"], [\"'Otolith shape analysis has been used in a number of studies as an inexpensive and powerful method for categorising fish in individual stocks. Elliptical Fourier analysis was used on three different amphidromous Sicyopterus species. Sicyopterus lagocephalus is a widespread species while the other two have a limited distribution area, Sicyopterus aiensis being endemic to Vanuatu, and Sicyopterus sarasini to New Caledonia. Both endemics live in sympatry with the widespread species. The otolith shape of all fish sampled was a clear species differentiator, thereby demonstrating that otolith shape is species-specific. At an intraspecific level there are different river populations within samples from Vanuatu, indicating a western group and an eastern \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ccentral\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d group.These results are congruent both for the endemic species, S. aiensis and for the cosmopolitan species. Finally, we found that, for S. lagocephalus, the cosmopolitan species, New Caledonian samples are close to western Vanuatu samples, the latter two being well differentiated from the eastern \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ccentral\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Vanuatu samples. The explanation for these results may lay either in the influence of environmental factors on the otolith shape, or in the influence of common early life history thus reflecting genetic factors, or a combination of both.'\"], [\"'Earthquake damage data is of vital importance both as an indicator of the likely performance of buildings in future earthquakes, as well as for the calibration of existing theoretical-analytical models regarding building vulnerability.

In contrast to previous hypotheses, this study demonstrated that when the Kanak traditional cultural complex emerged around ad 1000, following the initial 2,000\\\\xc2\\\\xa0years of human presence on the island, the vegetation cover showed few signs of deforestation and the tropical rainforests were still prominent. The vegetation surrounding Kanak settlement sites evolved during the first half of the 2nd millennium ad  towards a more open but more complex composition that included useful taxa. This was interpreted as showing a form of forest management and possible arboriculture (the cultivation and management of trees). However, in sharp contrast to its Melanesian neighbours, very little is known about arboricultural practices in New Caledonia. Through the interpretation of data from two sites in particular, a discussion of the two-step analytical process is used to argue for the existence of arboricultural practices associated with these sites: (1) using anthracological data to reconstruct the vegetational landscape, together with ethnobotanical, ethnohistorical and archaeological data; (2) allowing for the recognition of specific practices of forest domestication, based on the manipulation of plants and of spatial patterns of forests. At a time when archaeology is engaged in a process of post-colonial re-evaluation of its schemes of interpretation, it seems timely for archaeobotany to try integrating more indigenous systems of representation into its analyses. The approach presented here is an effort in this direction, trying to make sense of new data by reading them through a local lens.'\"], ['Abstract not available'], [\"'This paper compares two contemporary aesthetic expressions: tourist art from the Sepik River in Papua New Guinea and the New Guinea Sculpture Garden at Stanford University. Both aesthetic expressions undermine the conventional categories that classify art. Sepik River tourist art is motivated not by the drive to lend individual, subjective experience a material expression but by monetary desire. The New Guinea Sculpture Garden was expressly created so that Sepik artisans could expand beyond the confines of village traditions and create unfettered aesthetic expressions. But seemingly inauthentic Tourist Art actually represents many of the ideals normally ascribed to Western masterpieces, or High Art. Conversely, the High Art of the Sculpture Garden in many respects resembles inauthentic reproductions and the tenacity of traditional forms. Both tourist art and the sculpture Garden, however, have one key quality in common: they rupture conventional artistic cattegories.'\"], [\"'Bee diversity of the Southwest Pacific has been reported as depauperate despite the otherwise rich biodiversity and complex geological history for this region. However, due to a lack of bee-specific sampling, there is potential for higher bee diversity than previous studies suggest. Here, we review the current literature to summarise the extant diversity for each of the main island groups, the likely passages of species dispersal, and outline the main threats to Southwest Pacific populations. As key pollinators for both cultivated and native angiosperms, ensuring the persistence of native bee populations is critical for both food security and biodiversity conservation. With impending threats from land use change, invasive species and climate change, among others, understanding the true species diversity is important for assigning conservation priorities. We argue that future research in the region must encourage local expertise and build this into global research directions in an effort to address a lack of fundamental knowledge of bee diversity in island ecosystems.'\"], [\"'Studies show great variability in the prevalence of hyperopia among children.

First, I show how different political and socio-cultural views of possible target groups in the People's Republic of China and in the Republic of China have crucial consequences for the ways in which scientists define their research subject, collect and interpret their genetic samples, and conduct their research. Thus the unit of research, or group delineation, in genetic population studies cannot be viewed separately from its political and social context. Second, examples from population genetics in the People's Republic of China are used to show how genetic approaches to populations are necessarily mediated by social and political categories, which may or may not lead to conflicting interpretations of genetic data. Finally, in China and Taiwan research target groups are defined through different cultural and political perceptions intimately linked to these two nations\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 positions as players on the international political and diplomatic stage. Moreover, international and national competition and research politics affect sampling strategies and the selection of research populations. The political and economic issues related to the definition of socio-genetic groups are shown to have implications for bioethical debates.\"], [\"'Ambrym in Vanuatu is a persistently degassing island volcano whose inhabitants harvest rainwater for their potable water needs. The findings from this study indicate that dental fluorosis is prevalent in the population due to fluoride contamination of rainwater by the volcanic plume. A dental survey was undertaken of 835 children aged 6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9318\\\\xc2\\\\xa0years using the Dean\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Index of Fluorosis. Prevalence of dental fluorosis was found to be 96% in the target area of West Ambrym, 71% in North Ambrym, and 61% in Southeast Ambrym. This spatial distribution appears to reflect the prevailing winds and rainfall patterns on the island. Severe cases were predominantly in West Ambrym, the most arid part of the island, and the most commonly affected by the volcanic plume. Over 50\\\\xc2\\\\xa0km downwind, on a portion of Malakula Island, the dental fluorosis prevalence was 85%, with 36% prevalence on Tongoa Island, an area rarely affected by volcanic emissions. Drinking water samples from West Ambrym contained fluoride levels from 0.7 to 9.5\\\\xc2\\\\xa0ppm F (average 4.2\\\\xc2\\\\xa0ppm\\\\xc2\\\\xa0F, n\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa0158) with 99% exceeding the recommended concentration of 1.0\\\\xc2\\\\xa0ppm\\\\xc2\\\\xa0F. The pathway of fluoride-enriched rainwater impacting upon human health as identified in this study has not previously been recognised in the aetiology of fluorosis. This is an important consideration for populations in the vicinity of degassing volcanoes, particularly where rainwater comprises the primary potable water supply for humans or animals.'\"], [\"'Aggregated results from twenty years of community-engaged assiduous restoration of severely degraded coastal littoral systems in New Zealand (NZ) reveal numerous fundamental and substantive natural improvements to dune form, function, and storm resilience. This is accomplished by simple, low-cost exclusive utilisation of the variably threatened local indigenous dune plant species.

Historic plus current pressures such as coastal settlement impacts and continuing agricultural use of dunelands similarly threaten numerous global littoral margins, alongside recent concerns regarding the compounding effects of climate change. Successful, affordable, diligent dune restoration work pioneered in NZ has extensive benefits for other nations experiencing similarly challenging attrition on degraded coastal zones.

The 437-km2 island is an active monogenetic volcanic field with a constantly shifting locus of activity along a single apparent rift axis. Although the eruptions were not large ( \\\\xe2\\\\x89\\\\xa4VEI 2), unexpected shifts in Taveuni volcanism had the potential to affect habitation sites. Since known human settlement of the Fiji Group (ca. 950\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93750 BC), there have been at least 58 eruptions on Taveuni. Up to 25 of these eruptions potentially affected pre-European inhabitants of the island and at least four former occupation sites are known to have been affected by volcanic products. Despite apparent earliest settlement of Taveuni post-dating other nearby islands by up to 600\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89years, volcanism probably did not hinder or stall settlement of Taveuni compared with neighbouring islands. However, a period of voluminous eruptions between 300 and 500 AD covered much of south Taveuni with lava and/or thick tephra, apparently causing abandonment of at least this portion of Taveuni until approximately 1100 AD. Most eruptions were not of catastrophic proportions and, due to their localised effects, re-settlement was rapid in marginal unaffected areas. Localised stories and a relict place name survive to describe former eruption locations and effects since approximately 120\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93320\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89AD.

Invasive bees are thought to be exacerbating declines of Hawaii\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s native yellow-faced bees (Hylaeus) but, outside of the honey bee (Apis mellifera), relatively little empirical work has been done to track the origins and avenues of introduction for these species. Extant research addressing C. dentipes is limited, but suggests that it is a rapidly moving invasive, morphologically similar to both native and non-native bees within its introduced ecosystems, and may be capable of parthenogenic reproduction. Ceratina dentipes thus represents a potentially serious conservational challenge for terrestrial ecosystems throughout the Pacific. Here, we perform the first comprehensive phylogeographic assessment of C. dentipes, drawing from invasive populations across Hawaii and the South Pacific, and from native populations in Southeast Asia. Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction and analyses of molecular variation both indicate that C. dentipes is very recently introduced in Hawaii. Analyses also reveal that invasive populations of C. dentipes likely originated in Borneo or mainland Southeast Asia before being widely and rapidly dispersed, most likely through anthropogenic transport.'\"], [\"'When examining how the ecosystems of remote islands have developed, it is important to know the timing of when various elements arrived and whether they then diversified. Our understanding of the histories behind the biodiverse south west Pacific (SWP) archipelagos is limited, and further impeded by the complex geological histories of this region. Previous studies of the SWP short-tongued halictine bee fauna suggest their presence is much younger than the geological ages of these archipelagos, which is surprising given their critical role as pollinators in other terrestrial ecosystems. The long-tongued megachilid bees represent a considerable proportion of the known bee species for the region, yet little is known of their origin. Here we use genetic diversity within mitochondrial DNA to infer the likely ages and origins of megachilid species from Vanuatu, Fiji, and Samoa. Our results indicate a very recent origin for megachilids in the SWP, with many species exhibiting small intraspecific genetic distances. Three species share almost identical haplotypes with specimens from Southeast Asia, suggesting multiple human-aided introductions. Combined with data from recent studies on other bee groups present in the region, our results have broad implications for how the Pacific island biota developed and how we should approach its management.'\"], ['Abstract not available'], [\"'People not always do what they say that they do, nor do they always say what they really do, an opaqueness that seems to be a necessary condition for the production and reproduction of their mutual relations in society.

He may have learned it himself during his own lengthy fieldwork in New Guinea, but it may also have been an anthropological operationalization of the dictum of Freud, with whom Malinowski was struggling intellectually (at least from his side), that people are not always conscious of the motives of their own words and behavior. It also happens, however, that politicians, business, and church people alike consciously create stories or myths in which they hide their own personal our group intentions. These stories or myths are not only works of art of the human mind, but when they are successfully told within the context of, or directly concern power relationships, the narrator may be attributed mana.

Recently, LD has garnered substantial interest for its value to map and fine-map disease genes. We examine the distribution of LD between short tandem repeat alleles on autosomes and sex chromosomes in the Remote Oceanic population of Palau to evaluate whether the data are consistent with a recent hypothesis about the origins of genetic variation in Palau, specifically that the population experienced extensive male-biased gene flow following initial settlement. Consistent with evolutionary theory based on effective population size, LD between X-linked alleles is stochastically greater than LD between autosomal alleles, however, small but detectable LD occurs for autosomal markers separated by substantial distances. By contrast, while Y-linked alleles experience only one-third the effective population size of X-linked alleles, their mean value for pairwise LD is only slightly larger than X-linked alleles. For a small population known to experience at least two extreme bottlenecks, 56 six-locus Y\\\\xc2\\\\xa0haplotypes exhibit remarkable diversity (0.96), comparable to Y diversity of Europeans, however, autosomal and X-linked markers display significantly less diversity, as measured by heterozygosity (4.1% less).

Diagnosis is also imprecise in asymptomatic subjects due to the lack of accurate diagnostic tools and lack of clear distinction of impaired glucose tolerance. An alternative to the oral glucose tolerance test is urgently needed. Epidemiological studies of Type 2 diabetes and its complications are also fraught with difficulties due to variability of the oral glucose tolerance test, potential problems in glucose measurement, heterogeneity, population selection and problems in international comparisons due to differing age structures and life expectancy.

Spreading segments along these axes display highly contrasted axial morphologies, ranging from a rift valley to a prominent axial high. In some places, abrupt inversions of topography are observed between neighboring segments. Detailed analyses of bathymetry and backscatter maps reveal that axial highs are spotted with numerous coalescent volcanoes forming features ranging from irregular terrains to well-organized ridges. The volcanic edifices are distributed over a wide neovolcanic zone, which corresponds to the axial relief, suggesting on important contribution of volcanism to the relief construction. Comparisons between various ridge-shaped segments reveal that axial volcano-tectonic patterns are directly related to the local magma production and delivery, in a context of tectonic extension related to plate divergence, and suggest that coalescent volcanoes are fed from multiples short-lived and unconnected magma lenses. In the competition between horizontal and vertical accretion of oceanic crust, the spreading centers of the NNFB represent a special case where lava production is locally high enough and spreading rate is low enough to allow prominent axial highs to develop. The along axis morphologic variability is related to intermittent volcanic activity that may result from rapid temporal and spatial variations in the distribution of upper mantle convection cells below accretion centers, superimposed on the regional thermal anomaly located under the whole basin.'\"], [\"'This article seeks to determine whether PT Freeport Indonesia, an operating subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc., has acted in environmentally and socially responsible ways in the context of its operations in Papua, Indonesia, and how well it has responded to the legacy left by its less responsible operations from 1973 until the mid-1990s.

The 2009 re-emergence of bovine brucellosis in Fiji enabled us to do an interview-based questionnaire survey of 81 farms in the Wainivesi locality of the Tailevu province on the main island of Fiji to investigate what risk factors could have played a role in the re-emergence of the disease. The survey was conducted on 68 farms that had no positive cases of bovine brucellosis and on 13 farms in the same area where cattle had returned a positive result to the Brucella Rose Bengal test. Descriptive statistical methods were used to describe the demographic data while univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to evaluate the association between the selected risk factors and the presence of brucellosis on the farms at the time of the outbreak. The demographics of Fijian dairy farms are presented in the article and the biosecurity implications of those farming systems are discussed.

Empirical patterns of spatial distribution of these deposits suggest there must be fundamental generic controls on gold metallogeny. Various lines of evidence lead to the proposal that the underlying key generic factor controlling accretionary orogen gold metallogeny is regional-scale, long-term, pre- and syn-subduction heterogeneous fertilisation of the lithospheric mantle that becomes a source of mineralisation-associated arc magma or hydrothermal fluid components. This process provides a gold-enriched reservoir that can be accessed later in a diverse range of tectonomagmatic settings. Based on this concept, a unified model is proposed in which the formation of a major gold deposit of any type requires the conjunction in time and space of three essential factors: a fertile upper-mantle source region, a favourable transient remobilisation event, and favourable lithospheric-scale plumbing structure. This framework provides the basis for a practical regional-scale targeting methodology that is applicable to data-poor regions.'\"], [\"'The nearly latitudinal giant fracture zones in the northeastern Pacific Ocean are accompanied by narrow fault-line uplifts making up tectonic couples that strike for thousands of kilometers.

Yet tensions between married men and bachelors are often eclipsed by the need for warriors to defend the local community.

It is concluded that most European populations, both Northern and Southern, show a relatively high prevalence (4\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x938 per 100,000), and that the disorder may also be frequent in India and parts of central Asia. HD is notably rare in Finland and in Japan, but data for Eastern Asia and Africa are inadequate. The disorder may have been underestimated in the American black population. Populations derived from recent European imigration show frequencies and origins of HD comparable to those expected from their own origins and expansion; there is no evidence to suggest that the HD gene has spread disproportionally and its selective effect may be close to neutral. Multiple separate introductions of the gene have been the rule in large populations. Several major foci of HD exist as the result of rapid population expansion. It is likely that a number of separate mutations for HD will be shown to be responsible for the disease, but that the high frequency of HD in European populations will prove to be the result of one or a very small number of mutations, probably of great antiquity.\"], [\"'The Millennium Seed Bank (MSB) Partnership, developed and managed by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (RBG Kew), conserves propagules primarily from orthodox seed-bearing wild vascular plants.

A cross-sectional seroepidemiological study of HTLV-I showed that the age-specific proportion of healthy HTLV-I carriers in these ATL-endemic areas increased with age, especially over 40, and was higher in females than in males. Three main routes of HTLV-I transmission are recognized: 1) vertical transmission from mother to child mainly through breast milk; 2) horizontal transmission from man to woman through semen, and; 3) parenteral transmission from carrier donor to non-carrier recipient. The annual incidence rate of ATL among HTLV-I carriers is estimated at 2.0 in males and 0.5 in females, and the cumulative risk for ATL in HTLV-I carriers during a 70-year life span is 1%\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x935%. Possible risk factors for ATL in addition to HTLV-I infection were considered, i.e. genetic factors, environmental factors, nutritional condition, thymus involution etc., but none of these were found to be clearly associated with ATL.

From follow-up studies on the age-specific distribution of HTLV-I carriers in Japan, it is now speculated that the HTLV-I infection rate might have decreased naturally in the more recent generational cohort groups, even in the ATL-endemic areas. However, ATL in Japan is an important subject for study in the field of cancer epidemiology, and several trial intervention programs for the prevention of ATL, such as controls of vertical transmission from mother to child through breast milk, are now ongoing in the ATL-endemic areas of Japan.'\"], [\"'This review concerns issues related to the evolutionary and genetic origins of hypertensive disease.

The overall allele frequency was 7.5% for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)5, 0.2% for SNP8, 0.3% for SNP12, and 0.4% for SNP13. Nod2 mutations are mainly Caucasian alleles with strong distribution dissimilarity between single populations and major geographical regions. This regional diversity of Nod2 mutations within Europe points to the regional existence of selection pressure (possibly through dairy-associated bacterial infections within Neolithic cattle farming populations). The SNP5 gradient between Africa and the Middle East and its absence in Asian and Native American populations indicate that the evolution of this variant occurred in the Middle East. As mutations in exons 4e, 8, and 12 were only found in association with SNP5, this variant may have allowed selection pressure to arise.'\"], ['Abstract not available'], [\"' The populations that colonized Siberia diverged from one another in the Paleolithic and evolved in isolation until today. These populations are therefore a rich source of information about the conditions under which the initial divergence of modern humans occurred. In the present study we used the HLA system, first, to investigate the evolution of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) itself, and second, to reveal the relationships among Siberian populations. We determined allelic frequencies at five HLA class II loci (DRB1, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1, and DPB1) in seven Siberian populations (Ket, Evenk, Koryak, Chukchi, Nivkh, Udege, and Siberian Eskimo) by the combination of single-stranded conformational polymorphism and DNA sequencing analysis. We then used the gene frequency data to deduce the HLA class II haplotypes and their frequencies. Despite high polymorphism at four of the five loci, no new alleles could be detected. This finding is consistent with a conserved evolution of human class II MHC genes. We found a high number of HLA class II haplotypes in Siberian populations. More haplotypes have been found in Siberia than in any other population. Some of the haplotypes are shared with non-Siberian populations, but most of them are new, and some represent \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cforbidden\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d combinations of DQA1 and DQB1 alleles. We suggest that a set of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cpublic\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d haplotypes was brought to Siberia with the colonizers but that most of the new haplotypes were generated in Siberia by recombination and are part of a haplotype pool that is turning over rapidly.

Some see it as savior for the poor, providing food, and livelihoods, yet to others it is responsible for harboring and vectoring pathogenic diseases and is an archaic practice that has no place along the path toward development. Consequently, the activity receives a mixed reception, and despite much support in many instances, it certainly does not enjoy universal unimpeded progress. Here, we undertake a global tour of urban agriculture throughout the developing world in an attempt to elucidate the various benefits, costs, and hindrances associated with the practice. Through this analysis we identify the need for better understanding of the following six aspects if urban agriculture is to make a meaningful contribution to food security and sustenance of livelihoods in the future: (1) the global and regional extent of urban agriculture; (2) the contribution of urban agriculture to communicable diseases, especially malaria but also diarrheal disease; (3) the role that urban agriculture does and/or could play in abating both malnutrition and obesity; (4) the impacts of urban agriculture on women; (5) appropriate methods of achieving governance and institutional support; and (6) the risks posed by chemical pollutants, particularly as Africa becomes increasingly industrialized.

Massive sulfides at the Ungay Malobago and Hixbar deposits are spatially associated with dacitic volcanic rocks within a highly-deformed sequence of mafic volcanic and quartzofeldspathic sedimentary rocks. The massive sulfide deposits formed at the stratigraphic contact between footwall dacites and hangingwall mafic volcanic and quartzofeldspathic rocks. The deposits and their host strata have undergone regional metamorphism with strong penetrative deformation. Metamorphic mineral assemblages and textural evidence suggest that peak metamorphism was upper-greenschist to lower-amphibolite grade and syn-D1 deformation. Based on the age of regional metamorphism, deformation is inferred to be mid-Tertiary in age. Deformation at Rapu Rapu resulted in reorientation of the strata into a broad antiform with strong shallow-plunging elongation fabrics, overturning of the volcanic sequence that hosts the Ungay Malobago deposit, and complex folding of the mineralized zones.

The aim of the present study was to assess the role of somaclonal variations in the varietal diversification of these two clonally propagated crops. The study was conducted in six villages located each on distinct islands of Vanuatu, Melanesia. Overall, 203 varieties of taro and 80 varieties of yam were collected and DArTs were used for analysis. The overall quality of the DArT markers was high for both species. The percentage of polymorphic clones detected on the DArT array was low for taro (3\\\\xc2\\\\xa0%) and high (13\\\\xc2\\\\xa0%) for yam, with respectively 202 and 499 polymorphic clones. Each variety was characterized by its multilocus genotype based on its DArT presence/absence profile. For taro, the 203 varieties were represented by 126 unique genotypes and 34 distinct multilocus lineages (MLLs). The high number of unique genotypes and the presence of few varieties sharing a clonal origin, generated a high varietal richness index (R\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa00.83).

A key part of this understanding is quantifying the role of genetic ancestry in this phenotypic outcome. To provide insight into the relationship between ethnicity and drug response, this study first infers the global distribution of PGx variation and defines its structure. Second, the study evaluates if geographic population structure stems from all PGx loci in general, or if structure is caused by specific genes. Lastly, we identify the genetic variants contributing the greatest proportion of such structure. Our study describes the global genetic structure of PGx loci across the 52 populations of the Human Genome Diversity Cell-Line Panel, the most inclusive set of human populations freely available for studies on human genetic variation. By analysing genetic variation at 1,001 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in biotransformation of exogenous substances, we describe the between-populations PGx variation, as well geographical groupings of diversity. In addition, with discriminant analysis of principal component (DAPC), we infer how many and which groups of populations are supported by PGx variation, and identify which SNPs actually contribute to the PGx structure between such groups. Our results show that intergenic, synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs show similar levels of genetic variation across the globe. Conversely, loci coding for Cytochrome P450s (mainly metabolizing exogenous substances) show significantly higher levels of genetic diversity between populations than the other gene categories. Overall, genetic variation at PGx loci correlates with geographic distances between populations, and the apportionment of genetic variation is similar to that observed for the rest of the genome. In other words, the pattern of PGx variation has been mainly shaped by the demographic history of our species, as in the case of most of our genes. The population structure defined by PGx loci supports the presence of six genetic clusters reflecting geographic location of samples. In particular, the results of the DAPC analyses show that 27 SNPs substantially contribute to the first three discriminant functions. Among these SNPs, some, such as the intronic rs1403527 of NR1I2 and the non-synonymous rs699 of AGT, are known to be associated with specific drug responses. Their substantial variation between different groups of populations may have important implications for PGx practical applications.'\"], [\"'High-K calc-alkaline rocks from Cape Nelson, eastern Papua are dominated by andesites containing numerous basic inclusions.

The structural synthesis map obtained from geophysical data interpretation allows definition of the deep structure, nature and formation of the Fairway and New Caledonia Basins. Development of the Fairway Basin took place during the Late Cretaceous (95\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9365 Ma) by continental stretching.

The initial null hypothesis, that the population sample is homogeneous across ethnic groups, is easily rejected by likelihood ratio tests. Beyond this, methods for quantifying subdivision can be based on the probability of drawing alleles identical by descent (F ST ), probabilities of matching multiple locus genotypes, and occurrence of unique alleles. Population genetic theory makes quantitative predictions about the relation betweenF ST , population sizes, and rates of migration and mutation. Some VNTR loci have mutation rates of 10\\\\xe2\\\\x88\\\\x922 per generation, but, contrary to theory, we find no consistent association between the degree of population subdivision and mutation rate. Quantification of population substructure also allows us to relate the magnitudes of genetic distances between ethnic groups in New Zealand to the colonization history of the country. The data suggests that the closest relatives to the Maori are Polynesians, and that no severe genetic bottleneck occurred when the Maori colonized New Zealand. One of the central points of contention regarding the application of VNTR loci in forensics is the appropriate means for estimating match probabilities. Simulations were performed to test the merits of the product rule in the face of subpopulation heterogeneity. Population heterogeneity results in large differences in estimates of multilocus genotype frequencies depending on which subpopulation is used for reference allele frequencies, but, of greater importance for forensic purposes, no five locus genotype had an expected frequency greater than 10\\\\xe2\\\\x88\\\\x926.

A short sample interval can produce many observations, which is helpful in obtaining a reliably fitting model. However a short sample interval can bring many dummy ``observations'', a condition which adversely biases the fitting. The short sample interval also increases the chance to introduce non-independent observations as well, which violates a basic requirement of the Gumbel model. On the other hand, a large time interval not only reduces the number of observations, but also enlarges the observation error. Thus, for Greece, the most suitable parameters of the third Gumbel extreme model are obtained by using a sample interval which produces minimum error.

The dendrogram derived from activating KIR gene phylogenetic analysis revealed five clearly distinct clades corresponding to African, East Asian, Arab/Caucasoid, Mexican mestizo/Amerindian and South Asian populations. Our results illustrate the genetic contribution that Caucasoid and Amerindian populations have made toward present-day Mexicans and suggest an important Southeast Asian genetic contribution to native Amerindian populations.'\"], [\"'The KIR gene cluster exhibits a high degree of polymorphism in terms of gene content as well as allelic polymorphism, and data suggest that it is evolving rapidly. The KIR3DL1 locus is one of the most polymorphic loci within this cluster and is unique in that it encodes an activating receptor KIR3DS1, as well as multiple inhibitory KIR3DL1 allotypes. Because KIR3DS1 has been implicated in a number of diseases, we tested for the presence of KIR3DS1 variants that might affect its expression and activating capacity. Preliminary FACS analysis indicated that indeed some individuals with the KIR3DS1 allele showed no cell surface expression of the molecule. Sequencing analysis identified a variant with a complex deletion/substitution mutation in exon 4 (which encodes the D1 extracellular domain), resulting in a premature stop codon. We subsequently genotyped 3,960 unrelated individuals and determined the frequencies of this allele across geographically distinct world populations. The data indicate that the null KIR3DS1 allele is uncommon, arose on a single haplotype, and spread across geographically distinct populations.'\"], [\"'The learning difficulties for new entrant chemistry students from a multi-national, regional, tertiary education institution in the South Pacific were investigated using a purpose-designed diagnostic instrument. The instrument contained 25 items distributed across three themes: scientific reasoning, numeracy and scientific language literacy. The research findings suggest that the main learning difficulty facing these students is in numeracy with students able to interpret numerical data presented in graphical form and to complete rudimentary numerical calculations, but unable to use numerical data or perform calculations involving ratios. Targeted remedial tutoring, based on the results of this diagnostic test instrument, rather than content-driven extra tutorials, are suggested for remediation of learning difficulties.'\"], [\"'Purpose: The aims of this paper are (a) to examine sexualities (especially homosexuality, bisexuality, and transgenderism) and their correlates among Asian- and Pacific Islander (API) Americans, and (b) to explore their implications for community-based health education and prevention targeting API gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) individuals. Study selection: Derived from the literature of human sexuality, sex-roles socialization, and cross-cultural psychology, a framework was developed to examine sexualities as social roles among APIs. Data synthesis: There are three major sections to this article. The first section is a sociohistorical analysis about the diversity of the API communities, followed by a brief review of health beliefs and practices among APIs. The second section examines the framework used to study sexualities among APIs. In the last section, implications for API community-based health education and prevention targeting GLBT individuals are examined in light of a case study. Conclusions: Sexualities among APIs are discussed using a sexualities-as-social-role paradigm. This paradigm emphasizes the powerful influences of cultural forces in articulating social roles or scripts on sexualities. Sexual expression(s) and its correlates (e.g., identity) among API GLBT individuals are the product of a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9crelational\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d rather than a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9clinear\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d process\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a premise that differentiates it from the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9csexual script theory.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A fact-based case study was used to illustrate the various concepts of the paradigm.'\"], [\"'Rarely has a developing-country government been better prepared to negotiate with foreign investors than was the new government in Papua New Guinea in the mid-1970s as it prepared top deal with the huge Bougainville and Ok Tedi mining projects.

In the period between 1945 and 2015, there is a total of 76 ROs, which on average are equipped with competencies in around 11 different policy areas. There are two trends. First, both the number of ROs states have joined increases sharply over time as do the number of policy competencies states delegate to ROs. Second, not all states are equally inclined to nurture regional integration. To shed light on these patterns, this paper adopts a state-centered perspective. Based on rationalist international relations and regional cooperation theories, it develops hypotheses on state motives to join ROs and to delegate policy competencies to them. The analysis reveals several interesting insights: First, powerful states are proponents for regional integration. They join ROs, as they can be used as arenas or means to further national interests. Second, trade is also an important incentive. The stronger the trade interests of states are, the more ROs they become members of and the more policy competencies they equip their ROs with. Third, authoritarian states are less inclined to nurture regional integration and join ROs, since they might place limitations on governmental leeway in the future.'\"], [\"'The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a deltaretrovirus claimed to be aetiologically linked to the adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) besides other minor pathologies. HTLV-1 infection is worldwide distributed, despite its heterogeneous prevalence. Environmental factors and host-genetic background are very likely to determine the epidemiological profile of HTLV-1 prevalence and related disease confinement in distinct human ethnic populations and geographical coordinates, which raises the question if the virus is a real pathogen or a runaway well-organized packed genome of a burden host cell near death process.

The tropical sandfish (Holothuria scabra) has, in this context, been reared and produced with mixed success. In the Western Indian Ocean, villagers often participate in the export fishery for sea cucumbers as a source of income. However, with a growing concern of depleted stocks introduction of hatcheries to farm sandfish as a community livelihood and to replenish wild stocks is being promoted. This review identifies and discusses a number of aspects that constitute constraints or implications with regard to development of sandfish farming in the region. The conclusion is that for sandfish farming to live up to its expectations the possible impacts need to be further studied, and that improved evaluation of ongoing projects is required. In the interim, a precautionary approach toward new enterprise activities is suggested.'\"], [\"'The petrology and chemistry of alkaline rhyolites from Western Bahia State are investigated. Original mineralogy and bulk chemistry are modified by secondary processes (cataclastic metamorphism, hydrothermal leaching). The overall chemistry suggests a pattern consistent with derivation from material of near quartz-feldspar cotectic composition. This may represent a pathway for crustal fractionation and for partial melting within the continental crust of material of potassium-rich granitic composition. Ancient basemental biotite-rich gneisses are considered to be the most probable starting material. Possible correlations of volcanism with the main tectonics of the area and of the whole Brazilian shield are discussed.'\"], [\"'Small-scale society furnishes the bread and butter of archeological research. Yet our understanding of what these communities did and how they achieved their purpose is still rudimentary. Using the ethnography of contact-era New Guinea, this paper presents a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9csocial signaling\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d model of small-scale social systems that archeologists may find useful for contextualizing and interpreting the material record of these societies. It proposes that the organization of small-scale society was oriented, among other goals, towards biological and social reproduction, subsistence optimization, and military defense. To advance these multiple collective interests, however, these communities had to deal with three problems: an optimality problem, a conflict-of-interest problem, and a free-rider problem. The optimality problem was solved with a modular (or segmented) social structure, the conflict-of-interest problem by a process of social signaling, and these two solutions together operated to resolve the free-rider problems they created. In addition to explaining the structure and function of small-scale societies, the model provides a unified framework that can account for the ceremonial behaviors, core cultural conceptions, and leadership forms that these societies generated.'\"], [\"'The \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBoserup hypothesis\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d contends that land-intensive systems of agriculture will be adopted only when high population density precludes the use of land-extensive methods.

The Yeoval diorite complex is a calc-alkaline suite of rocks ranging from gabbros through diorites to granites with an association of fine-grained types. The dominant type of diorite is high in potassium (>2% K2O) and their classification is based mainly on chemical data rather than conventional petrography. As such the high-K diorites may be correlated with the high-K andesites of orogenic regions. Comparisons with occurrences of high-K andesites are made. Data are presented to show that the gabbros and diorites are genetically related whereas no relation between the diorites and granites can be established.'\"], [\"'This paper examines gender differences in out-marriage rates in the United States among 16 race and ethnic groups.

As such, the heterosexual component of human behavior is by and large viewed as being genetic, whereas it is homosexuality that is primarily the focus of scientific investigations into human sexual orientation. A historical review of homosexuality in diverse cultures reveals that significantly many cultures have existed where (male) bisexuality has been rather universal and that all cultures have condemned exclusive homosexuality, either legally or with the threat of social rejection. Neither of these facts can be rationalized using the ballpark \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9810%\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 statistic for homosexuality believed to be representative of human beings. This paper will attempt to provide a general underlying explanation for human sexuality as a whole. It will be argued that the varied forms of human sexual expression may be explained to some extent with the view that by virtue of their supreme intelligence, human beings do not possess an instinct to engage in heterosexual intercourse, human sexual orientation is fully determined by environment alone, and that due to rather universal childhood behavioral tendencies, human beings have a bias for acquiring a homosexual orientation over a heterosexual one or a bisexual one. Controlling this dominant homosexual tendency has always been a basic requirement for the propagation of societies.'\"], [\"'Management strategies for coral reefs are dependant on information about the spatial population structure and connectivity of reef organisms.

Instead, each turned to discriminatory trade barriers and trade blocs to try to revive domestic output. Persuaded that trade discrimination exacerbated the political tensions that erupted in World War II, policy makers constructed a postwar economic order that institutionalized nondiscrimination. Thus, Article 1 of the charter of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) mandates most-favored nation (MFN) treatment. We argue here that the MFN clause itself encouraged the adoption of practices and policies that actually recreated discrimination. In particular, we argue, developing countries, long regarded as victims of discrimination, institutionalized it in their negotiations with each other. We examine two developing country PTAs that included about 80 percent of all developing-country GATT members by output (the Global System of Trade Preferences and the Protocol Relating to Trade Negotiations). We show that as in the GATT writ large, their patterns of tariff cuts and trade expansion were highly skewed toward a small number of their largest members.

Whereas the total frequency of various nonfunctional alleles at the FUT2 locus in the worldwide populations so far examined is around 0.5, we have found only one individual heterozygous for a nonfunctional allele in the 90 Dani group members and a frequency of nonfunctional alleles of 0.1\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x930.2 in the admixed New Guineans. Admixed New Guineans had the Asian-specific null allele se  385  and the characteristic nonfunctional allele se  del2  found in Polynesians. In addition, both New Guinean populations had unique functional alleles (Se  375  and Se  400 ) with high frequencies (0.11\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x930.37); these are absent in other populations of the world except for African and Samoan populations. The Se  375  allele had G and C at positions\\\\xc2\\\\xa01009 and 1011 of the 3' untranslated region, respectively, whereas all other FUT2 alleles found so far in the world, except for se  428 , have 1009A and 1011T.

Corresponding positions of nonhuman primates have G and C, suggesting that the Se  375  allele is one of the ancestral alleles, reflecting the early human migration from Africa to New Guinea and the long isolation of Dani populations from neighboring populations.\"], [\"Megapode chicks hatch underground at a depth of between 40 and 150 cm, where external heat sources incubate the eggs. They dig themselves out without assistance from their parents. This is the first detailed study describing how long chicks remain under the soil and how they behave in this environment. 31 chicks of the Australian Brush-turkey (Alectura lathami) were observed while buried under a 40 cm high column of soil in a heated, transparent box. It took them, on average, 40 h (median) to reach the surface (range 26\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9355 h). After hatching, they only moved enough to form a small cavity within the soil in which they remained almost motionless for an average of 16 h (median). During this time, they dried their plumage, lost the chorioallantoic membrane, and presumably aerated their lungs and air sacs. After the initial resting period, for an average of 21 h (median) they dug upwards in short bouts only, traversing merely 8 cm. During this time they kept free a small cavity around themselves, in which they rested, preened and pecked at items in the soil, some of them invertebrates. Chicks covered the greatest distances (median 23 cm) within the last 64\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93120 min before emerging from the soil, while digging and pushing vigorously towards the surface, almost non-stop. If it is assumed that other, more endangered megapode species behave in a similar manner following hatching, these results suggest that in captive-release programs, chicks should not be released before the age of approximately 40 h, when they usually leave their natural incubation site. On the basis of these results I also critically discuss the classification of megapodes as \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98superprecocial\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99.

However, when legal enforcement is localized, imperfect, and costly, different governance structures for contracts carry implications for the sets of acceptable contracting partners. When legal enforcement for contracts is based on national law, whose reach is coterminous with a state's territory, acceptable partners tend to be defined territorially. When state enforcement of contract law is weak or nonexistent or when a contract is so vulnerable to nonperformance that it requires auxiliary support, actors must devise an alternative or supplement to state enforcement. The most relevant contracting boundaries then will be ones defining groups that can efficaciously create and maintain intertemporal, inter-issue, and inter-actor linkages. We examine just three of many possibilities: family-based, function-based, and ethnicity- or religion-based groups. These different systems of governance affect which entities are recognized as members in the club of actors, as well as how actors define their contracting boundaries and distinguish between those with whom they contract relatively freely and those with whom their contracting is more circumscribed.\"], [\"'Modern sugar cane varieties are derived from interspecific crosses involving as many as four species.

Here, we analyze the global richness patterns of two venomous snake clades, Viperidae and Elapidae. We used ordinary least squares multiple regression (OLS) and partial regression analysis to investigate to what extent actual evapotranspiration (AET; summarizing current environmental conditions) and biogeographical regions (representing evolutionary effects) were associated with species richness. For viperids, AET explained 45.6% of the variance in richness whereas the effect of this variable for elapids was almost null (0.5%). On the other hand, biogeographic regions were the best predictors of elapid richness (56.5%), against its relatively small effect (25.9%) in viperid richness. Partial regressions also revealed similar patterns for independent effects of climate and history in both clades. However, the independent historical effect in Elapidae decreased from 45.2 to 17.8% when we excluded Australia from the analyses, indicating that the strong historical effect that had emerged for the global richness pattern was reflecting the historical process of elapid radiation into Australia. Even after excluding Australia, the historical signal in elapid richness in the rest of the globe was still significant and much higher than that observed in viperid richness at a global scale (2.7% after controlling for AET effects). Differences in the evolutionary age of these two clades can be invoked to explain these contrasting results, in that viperids probably had more time for diversification, generating richness responses to environmental gradients, whereas the pattern of distribution of elapid richness can be more directly interpreted in an evolutionary context. Moreover, these results show the importance of starting to adopt deconstructive approaches to species richness, since the driving factors of these patterns may vary from group to group according to their evolutionary history.'\"], [\"'Some areas of the world are known to have a low incidence of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis, although the reasons for this are unknown.

To test the hypothesis that antibiotic use may have influenced the incidence of meningitis, incidence rates were correlated with antibiotic resistance.

Within these regions of low incidence, the proportion of cerebrospinal fluid specimens that had a leukocyte count or glucose or protein level suggestive of bacterial meningitis but from which no organism was identified was low, indicating that there was no large reservoir of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis that went undetected by the laboratory. Study-specific incidence rates of meningitis correlated with the proportion of isolates resistant to ampicillin (or producing beta-lactamase) (R2=0.35, P=0.0014).

Rather than the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cturn to difference\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d emerging as a post-Human Genome Project (HGP) phenomenon, interest in individual and group differences was a central, motivating concept in human genetics throughout the twentieth century. This interest was entwined with efforts to develop polymorphic \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cgenetic markers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d for studying human traits and diseases. We trace the technological, methodological and conceptual strategies in the late twentieth century that established single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as key focal points for locating difference in the genome. By embedding SNPs in microarrays, researchers created a technology that they used to catalog and assess human genetic variation. In the process of making genetic markers and array-based technologies to track variation, scientists also made commitments to ways of describing, cataloging and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cknowing\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d human genetic differences that refracted difference through a continental geographic lens.

Earthquakes are concentrated along the active tectonic boundaries of African, Eurasian, and Arabian plates. The study area is characterized by northward increasing sediment thickness leading to more damage to structures in the north due to multiple reflections of seismic waves. Unfortunately, man-made constructions in Egypt were not designed to resist earthquake ground motions. So, it is important to evaluate the seismic hazard to reduce social and economic losses and preserve lives. The probabilistic seismic hazard assessment is used to evaluate the hazard using alternative seismotectonic models within a logic tree framework. Alternate seismotectonic models, magnitude-frequency relations, and various indigenous attenuation relationships were amended within a logic tree formulation to compute and develop the regional exposure on a set of hazard maps. Hazard contour maps are constructed for peak ground acceleration as well as 0.1-, 0.2-, 0.5-, 1-, and 2-s spectral periods for 100 and 475\\\\xc2\\\\xa0years return periods for ground motion on rock. The results illustrate that Egypt is characterized by very low to high seismic activity grading from the west to the eastern part of the country. The uniform hazard spectra are estimated at some important cities distributed allover Egypt. The deaggregation of seismic hazard is estimated at some cities to identify the scenario events that contribute to a selected seismic hazard level. The results of this study can be used in seismic microzonation, risk mitigation, and earthquake engineering purposes.'\"], [\"'This study aimed to introduce clinical manifestations of patients in northeast Iran with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and describe the epidemiological features, as well as risk factors for HTLV-1 infection.

This study was conducted on 70 Nepalese skulls obtained from the Department of Anatomy, Nepal Medical College, and the Institute of Medicine from September 2017 to January 2018. The skulls were examined for the presence and topographic distribution of WBs. The occurrence of WBs at various sites was correlated among different head shapes. The incidence of skulls showing WBs was 88.57%. The WBs were observed at the lambdoid (61.43%), parietomastoid (41.43%), occipitomastoid (27.14%), pterion (25.71%), asterion (24.29%), lambda (11.43%), sagittal (7.14%) and coronal sutures (4.28%).

A cross-sectional study was carried out on 18 ATLL, 10 HAM/TSP patients and 18 HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers (ACs). DNA and mRNA of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were extracted for PVL and LAT, BIM, c-FOS and RAD51 gene expression measurement using qRT-PCR. The mean PVL in ATLL patients was 11,430\\\\xc2\\\\xa0\\\\xc2\\\\xb1\\\\xc2\\\\xa03770\\\\xc2\\\\xa0copies/104 which was statistically higher than ACs, 530\\\\xc2\\\\xa0\\\\xc2\\\\xb1\\\\xc2\\\\xa0119\\\\xc2\\\\xa0copies/104, (p\\\\xc2\\\\xa0<\\\\xc2\\\\xa00.001). The expression of BIM, and c-FOS in ATLL patients were higher than HTLV-1 ACs; however, there were no statistically significant differences.

In many parts of the humid tropics, coconut trees are frequently intercropped with food crops, or tree crops such as cocoa. The performance of such systems depends on planting patterns, but also on growing conditions for crops below the coconut canopy throughout the development of the coconut trees. We used a modelling approach providing indicators for assessing above-ground competition for light and below-ground competition for space, in order to optimize intercropping in coconut smallholdings. Light transmission and the number of coconut roots in the interrow were assessed in coconut smallholdings from 6 to 60\\\\xc2\\\\xa0years old. The modelling of light transmission through coconut stands was based on three-dimensional virtual coconut trees and a numerical light model that computed the shade cast by coconut trees on underlying crops. Root colonization in the interrow was assessed with virtual 3D coconut root systems. Our results showed that intercropping with shade-tolerant species was not limited by light transmission from the 35th year after coconut tree planting. However, at that stage of coconut tree development, the density of primary roots in the interrow limited intercrop development, especially for root and tuber crops. Alteration of the planting pattern over time increased light transmission but did not significantly affect root density. This modelling approach, which involved little parameterization that was easily done, appeared to be an efficient tool for recommending coconut tree planting patterns and densities, as well as indicating intercrop potential depending on their location in the most sunlit areas with minimum root competition.'\"], [\"' Pandanus is well represented in Papua New Guinea with over 66 species growing from sea level to 3,000 m.

We analyzed the biodiversity and community structures using the generalist/specialist concept. The site (community) order based on decreasing human disturbance was positively correlated with butterfly species diversity (H\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xb2), species richness (the total number of species), and the number of specialist species in a community, but not with the number of generalist species. The number of generalist species was rather constant, irrespective of the degree of human disturbance. Thus, both the butterfly species diversity and species richness were more dependent on the specialists than the generalists. Our analyses also showed that the generalist species were distributed widely over the communities, and they maintained high population densities, resulting in high rank status in abundance in a community, with more spatial variation in density per species. Specialist species showed the opposite trends. These results demonstrate that the generalist/specialist concept is a powerful tool applicable to analyse the biodiversity and structure of natural communities.'\"], [\"' Halfordia F.Muell is a genus of rainforest trees or shrubs native to New Guinea, New Britain, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and eastern Australia. There is debate about the number of species that should be recognised in the genus. Four species have been named, but authors have commonly recognised only two species, and some recent treatments accept just one widespread species with a broad ecological range. We sequenced two nrDNA markers (ITS and ETS) and two cpDNA markers (rbcL and trnL\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93trnF) from samples across the range of Halfordia in Australia and New Caledonia. Three allopatric nrDNA groups were resolved: one from southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales (Group A); one from the Wet Tropics region of North Queensland (Group B); and one from the Cape York region of North Queensland, Torres Strait and New Caledonia (Group C). These groups were also partly differentiated by more slowly evolving cpDNA markers; the exception was one widespread haplotype in Australia (presumed ancestral). The nrDNA groups support recognition of three previously described species: H. leichhardtii (Group A), H. scleroxyla (Group B) and H. kendack (Group C). Divergences among eastern Australia populations are best explained by vicariance and correlate with geographic breaks documented for other taxa (ranging in estimated ages from the mid-late Miocene to the Pleistocene).

This lack of scientific knowledge has not prevented an explosion of recommendations on how to conserve agrobiodiversity on-farm and it is possible to identify an emerging paradigm. Through a review of some of the assumptions on which this paradigm is based, we clearly show that if attempts to conserve agrobiodiversity on-farm are based on these misconceptions, they are likely to fail. By assessing the present activities of farmers, we propose a research agenda to increase the diversity available to farmers and to enhance farmers' capacity to manage this diversity dynamically. Increasing genetic diversification, combined with farmers' experimental abilities, and underpinned by the formal system, will ensure greater on-farm conservation of more useful genetic resources.\"], ['Abstract not available'], [\"'Developing countries struggle to provide adequate urban water services, failing to match infrastructure with urban expansion.

Significant correlations were found among braincase surface area, zygomatic bone surface area, cranial-facial index (facial surface area relative to braincase surface area) and local temperature, and a clear latitudinal gradient was also found in variation of braincase surface area. No significant correlations were found between zygomatic bone surface area, cranial-facial index and latitude. Our analysis supports the idea that the braincase functions as a radiator and is closely related to direct sunlight. We also suggest that absolute/relative craniofacial surface area varies consistently with predictions derived from Bergmann\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Rule. The mosaic craniofacial traits of American Indians may reflect retention of cold-derived, ancestral features, as well as a response to a slightly warmer climate. Because different craniofacial regions preserve environmental/genetic signatures differentially, caution is suggested when craniofacial anatomy is used for phylogenetic reconstruction and functional-morphological analysis.'\"], [\"'Obesity has been increasing in adolescents in Fiji and obesogenic dietary patterns need to be assessed to inform health promotion.

Phylogenetic analysis suggested that this virus strain (designated Monogahela) forms a possible evolutionary link between the Four Corners and New York hantaviruses.'\"], [\"'Regional trade agreements (RTAs) and currency unions (CUs) are potentially endogenous trade cost proxies in equations estimating their effects on bilateral trade. In case of both, this problem is magnified by the paucity of reliable instruments. Instead of resorting to the oft-employed alternative of panel data to address selection on just the time-invariant unobservables, this paper assesses the extent to which a positive association between CU or RTA membership and bilateral trade can be considered causal. In addition, it attends to recent concerns over the extensive margin of trade (at the country-level) and the issue of zero trade observations in log-linearized gravity models by relying more on a bivariate probit analysis. Despite not identifying point estimates, striking results are obtained. While most cross-sections exhibit a positive association between both RTAs and CUs and trade, the evidence in favor of a robust causal effect is strong mainly for CUs. However, the magnitude of the CU effect is still sensitive to the amount of selection on unobservables. Moreover, selection into RTAs (CUs) is mostly found to be positive (negative). Finally, the presence of spillovers across the policy regimes is also detected.'\"], [\"'Anecdotal evidence from many hunter-gatherer societies suggests that successful hunters experience higher prestige and greater reproductive success. Detailed quantitative data on these patterns are now available for five widely dispersed cases (Ache, Hadza, !Kung, Lamalera, and Meriam) and indicate that better hunters exhibit higher age-corrected reproductive success than other men in their social group. Leading explanations to account for this pattern are: (1) direct provisioning of hunters\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 wives and offspring, (2) dyadic reciprocity, (3) indirect reciprocity, (4) costly signaling, and (5) phenotypic correlation. I examine the qualitative and quantitative evidence bearing on these explanations and conclude that although none can be definitively rejected, extensive and apparently unconditional sharing of large game somewhat weakens the first three explanations. The costly signaling explanation has support in some cases, although the exact nature of the benefits gained from mating or allying with or deferring to better hunters needs further study.'\"], [\"'This article examines transformations associated with changes in resource use and land cover dynamics in the community of S\\\\xc3\\\\xa3o Manoel, Maranh\\\\xc3\\\\xa3o state, in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. The shifting cultivator peasants in S\\\\xc3\\\\xa3o Manoel integrate swidden fields for annual cropping, the extraction of babassu palm products, and pastures for cattle ranching. Since the early twentieth century, predominant vegetative cover patterns have been altered from species-rich mature forests to secondary succession with babassu dominant to pasture or swidden fields containing palm stands of various densities. A grounded political ecology of resource use in the area suggests that management strategies and the resulting land cover dynamics integrate site-specific decisions of peasant producers. I discuss the trajectory of production strategies in S\\\\xc3\\\\xa3o Manoel since the establishment of the community in the 1920s, and identify the multiple dimensions affecting resource use and environmental outcomes, with an emphasis on the period following land struggles and the recovery of peasant tenure rights in the mid-1980s.

These shortcomings can be addressed through the incorporation of evolutionary, historical, and global perspectives. The objective of this review is to propose a unified theory of optimal dietary fatty acid intake for CHD prevention that integrates critical insights from evolutionary, historical, global, and modern perspectives. This broad approach may be more likely than previous methods to characterize optimal fatty acid intakes.'\"], [\"' The biodiversity hotspot for conservation of New Caledonia has facing high levels of forest fragmentation.

The implementation of the Elementary Cultural Mathematics Syllabus is in line with the above curriculum emphasis. Given the aims of the reform, the research reported here investigated the influence of children's own mother tongue (Tok Ples) and traditional counting systems on their development of early number knowledge formally taught in schools. The study involved 272 school children from 22 elementary schools in four provinces. Each child participated in a task-based assessment interview focusing on eight task groups relating to early number knowledge. The results obtained indicate that, on average, children learning their traditional counting systems in their own language spent shorter time and made fewer mistakes in solving each task compared to those taught without Tok Ples (using English and/or the lingua franca, Tok Pisin). Possible reasons accounting for these differences are also discussed.\"], [\"'Cultural explanations of psychopathology in the West have rarely employed models derived by anthropologists for small-scale non-literate communities.

These disturbances are especially prevalent in people of South Asian (Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi) descent. We examined the relationship of glucose intolerance to body fat pattern in a population survey of 2936 men and 537 women of South Asian and European origin living in London, UK. In both groups glucose intolerance (defined as diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance) was more strongly associated with waist-hip girth ratio than with skinfolds or body mass index. The associations between body mass index and glucose intolerance were fully accounted for by waist-hip ratio. In European men with normal glucose tolerance fasting insulin levels were more strongly correlated with body mass index than with waist-hip ratio. Physical activity scores were lower in South Asians than in Europeans but no statistically significant associations between glucose intolerance and low physical activity were detectable. Leisure-time physical activity scores were inversely correlated with 2 h insulin levels in both groups. In contrast with other studies these results suggest that a specific effect of intra-abdominal fat deposition underlies the association between glucose intolerance and obesity. The association between hyperinsulinaemia and obesity is less specific for centrally-distributed fat. When measured appropriately waist-hip ratio is the most valid anthropometric index for identifying individuals whose obesity predisposes them to glucose intolerance.'\"], [\"'Editor Simon Anholt asked Jeremy Hildreth for his \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98big picture\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 thoughts on the state of the place branding field \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 where it is, and where it might be going. This article employs many evocative metaphors to define and describe the benefits and hazards of place branding. The article takes the view that, broadly speaking, successful place branding results when certain mistakes are avoided and certain other challenges are imaginatively and thoughtfully resolved. The article proposes a generic, narrative meta-model of place branding, which any place may refer to regardless of the present level of development of its product, perception or promotion.

The calculations were performed for bedrock site conditions (Vs30\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa0760\\\\xc2\\\\xa0m/s). A logic-tree framework was applied to include epistemic uncertainty in the seismic source as well as ground motion modelling processes. Two seismic source models were developed using area source zones and smoothed seismicity, respectively. Based on available geological and seismological data, defined seismic sources were classified into four different tectonic environments. For each of the tectonic regimes three ground motion prediction equations were selected and used to estimate the ground motions at a grid of sites with spacing of 0.1\\\\xc2\\\\xb0 in latitude and longitude. Results show a high level of hazard in the coastal areas of Huon Peninsula and New Britain\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93Bougainville regions and a relatively low level of hazard in the southwestern part of Papua New Guinea. Seismic hazard disaggregation results show that in the Huon Peninsula region high seismic hazard is caused by modelled frequent moderate to large earthquakes occurring on the Ramu-Markham Fault Zone. In the New Britain\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93Bougainville region the distance to the subduction zone associated with the New Britain Trench mainly controls the calculated level of hazard. It is also shown that the estimated level of peak ground acceleration is very sensitive to the selection of ground motion prediction equations. Overall our results differ significantly from those of previous studies, and we surmise that these differences are due to our use of modern ground motion prediction equations and earthquake source information.'\"], [\"'A vulnerability analysis of c.300 unreinforced Masonry churches in New Zealand is presented. The analysis uses a recently developed vulnerability index method (Cattari et al. in Proceedings of the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering NZSEE 2015 conference, Rotorua, New Zealand, 2015a; b; SECED 2015 conference: earthquake risk and engineering towards a Resilient World, Cambridge; Goded et al. in Vulnerability analysis of unreinforced masonry churches (EQC 14/660)\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94final report, 2016; Lagomarsino et al. in Bull Earthq Eng, 2018), specifically designed for New Zealand churches, based on a widely tested approach for European historical buildings. It consists of a macroseismic approach where the seismic hazard is defined by the intensity and correlated to post seismic damage. The many differences in typologies of New Zealand and European churches, with very simple architectural designs and a majority of one nave churches in New Zealand, justified the need to develop a method specifically created for this country. A statistical analysis of the churches damaged during the 2010\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x932011 Canterbury earthquake sequence was previously carried out to develop the vulnerability index modifiers for New Zealand churches. This new method has been applied to generate seismic scenarios for each church, based on the most likely seismic event for 500\\\\xc2\\\\xa0years return period, using the latest version of New Zealand\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s National Seismic Hazard Model. Results show that highly vulnerable churches (e.g. stone churches and/or with a weak structural design) tend to produce higher expected damage even if the intensity level is lower than for less vulnerable churches in areas with slightly higher seismicity. The results of this paper provide a preliminary tool to identify buildings requiring in depth structural analyses. This paper is considered as a first step towards a vulnerability analysis of all the historical buildings in the country, in order to preserve New Zealand\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cultural and historical heritage.'\"], [\"'Regional trade agreements (RTAs) are usually classified according to their form into four broad categories: preferential arrangements, free trade agreements, customs unions and common markets.
