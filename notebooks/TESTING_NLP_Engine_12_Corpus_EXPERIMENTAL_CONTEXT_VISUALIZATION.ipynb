The Nilgiri langurs in Brahmagiri-Makut and the lion-tailed macaques in Sirsi-Honnavara are the northernmost populations of the 2 species in the Western Ghats. The 2 regions represent changes in ecological zones in the Western Ghats. In Brahmagiri-Makut, Hanuman langurs and bonnet macaques occupy lower elevations whereas Nilgiri langurs live in relatively higher altitudes. Only one group of lion-tailed macaques was in Brahmagiri-Makut. In the forests of Sirsi-Honnavara, 3 species of primates viz. lion-tailed macaque, bonnet macaque and Hanuman langur were in larger numbers throughout the forest. A self-sustainable single population of 32 groups of lion-tailed macaques occurred in Sirsi-Honnavara. Few subspecies of Hanuman langurs exist in the study regions. Due to local hunting practices, the relative abundance of primates in Brahmagiri-Makut is lower than that in Sirsi-Honnavara.\\'Abstract: \\'Hill forts of Northern Western Ghats offer an interesting mix of man-made and natural habitats and as a result shelter a great diversity of endemic and threatened plants. Strict protection of certain areas and selective interference for strategic reasons on hill forts are responsible for maintenance of large protected populations of local endemic species. This has also created special patterns of plant distribution. In recent years, many novelties have been described from forts. Though hill forts have gained importance from the historical and archeological point of view, they are seldom considered as biodiversity conservatories. We suggest here that while prioritizing conservation areas in Northern Western Ghats, hill forts should be given a status of local biodiversity hotspots and conservation should be provided to all microhabitats that are natural as well as man-made. This will assure protection of endemic and threatened species of Western Ghats as well as local endemics of Northern Western Ghats.\\'hotspot, Tamil Nadu, India\\'Abstract: \\'This study highlights spatial characterization of evergreen forests of the Western Ghats an ecological hotspot in Tamil Nadu, India using remote sensing and GIS-based analysis in conjunction with ground-based phytosociological data. The evergreen forests of Tamil Nadu are distributed in four distinct hill ranges, Nilgiri, Anamalai, Palni and Tirunelveli, having different topographic, bioclimatic and disturbance levels. The evergreen forests in these four hill ranges are characterized for their uniqueness in terms of patch characteristics and phytosociology. A vegetation type map was prepared using IRS LISS III satellite data and was used to study the patch characteristics in terms of patch size, number, shape, porosity and landcover diversity (LD). The phytosociological characteristics, namely species richness, diversity, similarity and community assemblages, were studied using ground data collected from 95 sample points of 0.1 ha size. Patch size and number revealed distinct intactness and disturbance levels in these four hill ranges. Evergreen forests in the Tirunelveli hills comprising 216.09 km2 are distributed in 306 patches, and in the Palni hills, with 285 km2, forests are distributed in 1029 patches, indicating a high level of fragmentation. LD, indicating the spatial heterogeneity of landcover, was very high in the Nilgiri hills and low in the Tirunelveli hills. The spatial analysis helped to delineate homogenous large patches of evergreen forest, which can be adopted for appropriate conservation strategies. A total of 342 tree species belonging to 4490 stems were evaluated for phytosociology. Only of similarity in terms of species distribution was found across the hill ranges. Conjunctive analysis of patch characteristics and species distribution showed high species richness in less fragmented evergreen forests and vice versa. The study identified the areas of prioritization in terms of ecorestoration and conservation based on patch and phytosociological characteristics.\\'Abstract: \\'Seventy one fish species belonging to 27 families and 50 genera were collected from various sampling sites spread along the upstream and downstream parts of the Chalakudy river, in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in Kerala, South India. Cyprinids were the most dominant group represented by 24 species belonging to 13 genera, followed by the catfishes of the family Bagridae (7 species from 2 genera) and loaches belonging to the family Balitoridae (5 species from 5 genera). Of the 71 species, 4 belong to the (CR) and 16 to the (EN) category. 3 of the critically endangered species are strictly endemic to the Chalakudy river system. We also collected 5 exotic species several of them categorized as potential pest. Fish species richness (FSR) showed a direct relationship with increasing stream order with maximum values observed in the downstream/low elevation regions. Considerable differences were observed in the FSR between different microhabitats with maximum values observed in bed rock and pool riffle and the lowest in regimes followed by step pools. Diversity and species richness decreased with increasing altitude and higher diversity and species richness were observed in sampling sites located between above sea level. A definite temporal partitioning was also observed with regard to FSR with higher richness during the day time and the lowest observed at dawn. Indiscriminate collection of endemic and threatened ornamental fish species for export, exploitation of endangered food fishes by forest-dwelling communities and local fisher folk, pollution, loss of riparian cover, damming and exotic species threaten the rich ichthyofaunal diversity of Chalakudy River. An urgent need exists for studying the life history traits and demography of the most important endemic and threatened fishes, as lack of information on these aspects have significantly affected conservation efforts. The implementation of strong management strategies like fixing total allowable catch (TAC), and the use of quotas are needed to reduce the overall collection pressure with regard to the trade in native ornamental species from the river.\\'Abstract: \\'In order to understand the vegetative and reproductive phenological behaviour of Syzygium caryophyllatum, the knowledge of the factor influencing leaf flushing, maturation, leaf fall, flowering and fruiting of this tree species is required. The authors used field observations collected over at Neeliyarkottam sacred grove, Kannur district, Western Ghats of Kerala, India, to characterize the relationship between phenological pattern and biotic and abiotic (climatic) factors. The relationship between phenological pattern of the selected species and abiotic variables such as precipitation and temperature exhibited significant variation among the species. Flowering begins from second week of March to till May with a peak in April followed by the fruiting. Hand pollination tests indicated that most of the fruits were developed through xenogamous pollination. The breeding test results indicated S. caryophyllatum is self-incompatible and out-crossing is fertile. The foraging activities of some common pollinators on S. caryophyllatum flowers were also studied. The main flower visitors and foragers include honey bees, different varieties of butterflies, wasps, carpenter bees, small flies, bugs and ants. The flowering and fruiting exclusively occur in the dry season and are followed by germination and establishment of seedlings during the subsequent rainy season. The authors conclude that the investigations on the reproductive phenology, floral biology, breeding systems and pollinator visitation are important due to population survival of the species and its evolutionary success.\\'India\\'Abstract: \\' Decalepis arayalpathra, a critically endangered plant species, has a restricted and fragmented population in Southern Western Ghats, India. This study is a first attempt to evaluate genetic diversity and population structure in the nine wild populations of D. arayalpathra based on molecular pattern realized through the marker assays. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA)-based hierarchical clustering of both the marker assays suggest strong genetic clustering between the individuals corresponding to their geographical ranges. Mantel test also corroborates a close genetic proximity between genetic and geographic data Population genetic analysis revealed low levels of gene flow [inter-simple sequence repeat and random amplified polymorphic DNA between the populations, in line with high genetic differentiation with ISSR and 0.440 with RAPD), which was also supported by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), that (ISSR) and (RAPD) total variation resided within populations. Bayesian model-based STRUCTURE analysis detected three genetic clusters showing the high degree of admixture within population. Based on the findings, such as inbreeding depression and the loss of genetic diversity, suggestions for conservation strategies are provided to preserve the genetic resources of this endangered species.\\'Abstract: \\'Spatially explicit approach is essential to prioritise the ecosystems for biodiversity conservation. In the present study, the conservation status of 20 protected areas of the Western Ghats of Kerala, India, was analysed based on long-term changes in forests landscape level changes in fragmentation and forest fires This study has shown that a significant forest loss occurred in protected areas before declaration. Idukki is one of the major protected areas which showed a drastic reduction (18.83%) in its forest cover. During Periyar tiger reserve had lost core 3 forest area followed by Peppara Parambikulam Chimmony Peechi-Vazhani and Neyyar An area of of the protected area was affected by fires in 2014. Overall protected area-wise decadal analysis indicates Periyar has the highest number of fire incidences followed by Wayanad, Kurinjimala, Silent Valley and Eravikulam. Disturbances in the form of fires and fragmentation still exist and may have significant conservation threat to flora and fauna. Among protected areas, many are having a probability to go under threat or dynamic stage. Chinnar, Thattekkad and Kurinjimala sanctuaries are representing high levels of vulnerability, or they are near to decline stage. Habitat level monitoring of the anthropogenic disturbances can be efficiently useful for the strategic conservation planning. The present study has provided geospatial database on spatial patterns of deforestation, fragmentation and forest fires in protected areas of Kerala. Conservation prioritization approach based on these parameters will be useful for the strategic planning in the state of Kerala.\\'Abstract: \\'This study documents the distribution patterns, endemism and uniqueness (species richness) of fishes in the Tunga and Bhadra rivers of Western Ghats, India. We recorded 77 species represented by 7 orders, 16 families and 44 genera, of which 36 species are endemic to Western Ghats, 12 species endemic to India and 26 species endemic to the Indian Subcontinent. Based on our analysis on the distribution patterns, the Tunga River is richer in diversity and higher in endemism than the Bhadra. We calculated the similarity of the species composition among sites within these two rivers using the Jacquard index. The similarity index between the sampling sites of these rivers revealed that the similarity decreases with increasing distance between the sampling sites. Of the 77 fish species we collected, 8 species (11.1%) are in the Critical category, 10 species (13.8%) are in the High Risk category, 36 species (50%) are in the Moderate category and the remaining 18 species (25%) are at lower risk. The threat status of fishes found in the Tunga and Bhadra rivers strongly suggests the need for effective conservation measures to conserve the fish species richness of these rivers.\\'Abstract: \\'Climate change, alien species, and use of land for intensive farming and development are causing severe threat to the plant genetic diversity worldwide. Hence, conservation of biodiversity is considered fundamental and also provides the livelihoods to millions of people worldwide. Medicinal plants play a key role in the treatment of a number of diseases, and they are only the source of medicine for majority of people in the developing world. The tropical regions of the world supply the bulk of current global demand for albeit with increasing threat to populations in the world and its genetic diversity. India is a major center of origin and diversity of crop and medicinal plants. India poses out 20,000 species of higher plants, one third of it being endemic and 500 species are categorized to have medicinal value. The Western Ghats is one of the major repositories of medicinal plants. It harbors around 4,000 species of higher plants of which 450 species are threatened. Currently, the number of species added to the red list category in this region is increasing, and the valuable genetic resources are being lost at a rapid rate. Demand for medicinal plants is increasing, and this leads to unscrupulous collection from the wild and adulteration of supplies. Providing high-quality planting material for sustainable use and thereby saving the genetic diversity of plants in the wild is important. During the last of intensive research, Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute has developed in vitro protocol for rapid regeneration and establishment of about 40 medicinally important rare and threatened plants of Western Ghats. In situ conservation alone would not be effective in safeguarding these important species. Thus, utilizing the biotechnoligical approach to complement ex situ conservation program is becoming vital. Propagating biotechnology tools in plant conservation program is a prerequisite to succeed in sustainable use and to complement the existing ex situ measures. In addition to propagation, storage of these valuable genetic resources is equally important. In vitro slow growth of 35 species and cryopreservation using embryo/meristem/seed in 20 different species of rare medicinal plants of this region is accomplished. Plants developed in vitro of ten medicinal plants, which have restricted distribution, were reintroduced in the natural habitat as well.\\'Abstract: \\'The status of the endemic and endangered lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus) has not been properly assessed in several regions of the Western Ghats of southern India. We conducted a study in Parambikulam Forest Reserve in the state of Kerala to determine the distribution, demography, and status of lion-tailed macaques. We laid 5km2 grid cells on the map of the study area (644km2) and made four replicated walks in each grid cell using GPS. We gathered data on lion-tailed macaque group locations, demography, and site covariates including trail length, duration of walk, proportion of evergreen forest, height of tallest trees, and human disturbance index. We also performed occupancy modeling using PRESENCE ver. 3.0. We estimated a minimum of 17 groups of macaques in these hills. Low detection and occupancy probabilities indicated a low density of lion-tailed macaques in the study area. Height of the tallest trees correlated positively whereas human disturbance and proportion of evergreen forest correlated negatively with occupancy in grid cells. We also used data from earlier studies carried out in the surrounding Anamalai Tiger Reserve and Nelliyampathy Hills to discuss the conservation status in the large Anamalai Hills Landscape. This landscape harbors an estimated population of 1108 individuals of lion-tailed macaques, which is about one third of the entire estimated wild population of this species. A conservation plan for this landscape could be used as a model for conservation in other regions of the Western Ghats.\\'Abstract: \\' Coelogyne nervosa is an epiphytic orchid endemic to Western Ghats, South India. The mature seeds of C. nervosa were cultured on MS (Murashige and Skoog), MS, Kn (Knudson) and VW (Vacin and Went) media to evaluate the seed germination response. Of the four basal media used, MS medium supported maximum seed germination. Further experiments to enhance seed germination were done on MS medium supplemented with various concentrations (10, 20, 30 and of coconut water (CW). Thirty percent CW gave the highest response in terms of percent seed germination (96), fresh weight and protocorm length Since CW containing medium did not support further seedling growth, each seedling was isolated and cultured on MS medium supplemented with either BA (6-benzylaminopurine) or Kin (kinetin) alone each) or in combination with NAA (1-naphthaleneacetic acid; Maximum growth was observed on MS medium supplemented with BA and NAA On this medium, the seedlings reached an average length of with 2.8 well expanded green leaves per seedling. Similarly optimum, healthy, white root induction (3.3 roots/seedlings) was also observed on the same medium. The rooted seedlings were successfully transplanted to pots with success. The 2-year-old tissue culture derived plants produced normal flowers and fruits.\\'India\\'Abstract: \\'Understanding how different audience groups perceive wildlife is crucial for the promotion of biodiversity conservation, especially given the key role of flagship species in conservation campaigns. Although the heterogeneity in preferences reinforces the need for campaigns tailored to specific target audiences, many conservation education and awareness campaigns still claim to target the Audiences can be segmented according to social, economic, and cultural criteria across which species perceptions are known to vary. Different studies have investigated the preferences of different groups towards certain wildlife species, but these are largely confined to a single conservation stakeholder group, such as tourists, local communities, or potential donors in western countries. In this study, we seek to determine from a multi-stakeholder perspective, audience characteristics that influence perceptions towards wildlife at Valparai, a fragmented plateau in the Western Ghats region of the Western Ghats-Sri Lanka Hotspot. We found that stakeholder group membership was the most important characteristic followed by gender. While some characteristics had a wide-scale effect others were restricted to a few species. Our results emphasize the need to design conservation campaigns with specific audiences in mind, instead of the very often referred toAbstract: \\'Ecologically sensitive regions (ESRs) are the with the exceptional biotic and abiotic elements. Identification of ESRs considering spatially both ecological and social dimensions of environmental variables helps in ecological and conservation planning as per Biodiversity Act, 2002, Government of India. The current research attempts to integrate ecological and environmental considerations into administration, and prioritizes regions at Panchayat levels (local administrative unit) in Uttara Kannada district, Central Western Ghats, Karnataka state considering attributes (biological, Geo-climatic, Social, etc.) as ESR through weightage score metrics. The region has the distinction of having highest forest area (80.48%) in Karnataka State, India and has been undergoing severe anthropogenic pressures impacting biogeochemistry, hydrology, food security, climate and socio-economic systems. Prioritisation of ESRs helps in the implementation of the sustainable developmental framework with the appropriate conservation strategies through the involvement of local stakeholders.\\'Abstract: \\'As large nature reserves occupy only a fraction of the land surface, conservation biologists are critically examining the role of private lands, habitat fragments, and plantations for conservation. This study in a biodiversity hotspot and endemic bird area, the Western Ghats mountains of India, examined the effects of habitat structure, floristics, and adjacent habitats on bird communities in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and tropical rainforest fragments. Habitat and birds were sampled in 13 sites: six fragments (three relatively isolated and three with canopy connectivity with adjoining shade-coffee plantations and forests), six plantations differing in canopy tree species composition (five coffee and one cardamom), and one undisturbed primary rainforest control site in the Anamalai hills. Around 3300 detections of 6000 individual birds belonging to 106 species were obtained. The coffee plantations were poorer than rainforest in rainforest bird species, particularly endemic species, but the rustic cardamom plantation with diverse, native rainforest shade trees, had bird species richness and abundance comparable to primary rainforest. Plantations and fragments that adjoined habitats providing greater tree canopy connectivity supported more rainforest and fewer open-forest bird species and individuals than sites that lacked such connectivity. These effects were mediated by strong positive effects of vegetation structure, particularly woody plant variables, cane, and bamboo, on bird community structure. Bird community composition was however positively correlated only to floristic (tree species) composition of sites. The maintenance or restoration of habitat structure and (shade) tree species composition in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and rainforest fragments can aid in rainforest bird conservation in the regional landscape.\\'Abstract: \\'Conservation initiatives are designed to address threats to forests and biodiversity, often through partnerships with natural-resource users who are incentivized to change their land-use and livelihood practices to avoid further biodiversity loss. In particular, direct incentives programmes that provide monetary benefits are commended for being effective in achieving conservation across short timescales. In biodiversity-rich areas, outside protected areas, such as coffee agroforestry systems, direct incentives, such as certification schemes, are used to motivate coffee producers to maintain native tree species, natural vegetation, restrict wildlife hunting, and conserve soil and water, in addition to encouraging welfare of workers. However, despite these claims, there is a lack of strong evidence of the on-ground impact of such schemes. To assess the conservation importance of certification, we describe a case study in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot of India, in which coffee growers are provided price incentives to adopt Rainforest Alliance certification standards. We analyse the conservation and social outcomes of this programme by studying experiences of participating in certification. Despite high compliance and effective implementation, we find a strong case for the endorsement of as with no changes in farm management as a result of certification. We find that such as participation in certification creates grounds for diminishing credibility and local support for conservation efforts. Working towards locally relevant conservation interventions, rather than implementing global blueprints, may lead to more meaningful biodiversity conservation and increased community support for conservation initiatives in coffee landscapes.\\'Abstract: \\'The Western Ghats of India are known to be a major biological hotspot that supports plant diversity and the Kas Plateau, a lateritic plateau of the northern Western Ghats, we examined mesoscale distributions of endemic, rare, or locally significant plant species in forest habitats or on the plateau and its escarpments, and assessed the edaphic and hydrological parameters of seasonal plateau microhabitats.\\'Abstract: \\'Forest resource conservation has been widely accepted as a key to sustain the local and regional economic development. The forest edges are affected by anthropogenic activities including deforestation, forest fragmentation, selective logging, extraction of non-timber forest products, collection of medicinal plants, recreations, hydroelectric projects and its associated developmental activities, which alter the biodiversity. The present study intends to evaluate the edge effect on vegetation structure and species compositions in the tropical forest ecosystems at Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary in the Western Ghats. High species richness (number of species) and diversity indices were observed in the site III (completely undisturbed forest) compared to site I (adjacent to the village/ edge of the forest, which is next to the teak plantation, severely disturbed forest) and site II (in between the undisturbed forest and moderately disturbed forest) while density of tree species showed greater value in site II. Single species such as Tectona grandis (IVI of 80) and Terminalia paniculata (IVI of 112) were the dominant tree species in site I and site II, respectively, whereas, in site III Terminalia bellirica, Bishofia javanica and Syzgium gardneri shared the dominance. Perturbation leads to alien plant invasion particularly Lantana camara, Eupatorium odoratum and Ageratum conizoides. Site II is at forest transition level because the site is dominated by both natural species as well as plantation species such as Tectona grandis. This site seems to be a buffer zone on natural forest and plantations. Further studies are required to analyse the real patterns of regeneration and dynamic change due to human impact by long term monitoring with the establishment of permanent plots.\\'Abstract: \"Contamination-free, simple, cheap and efficient protocol for long term in vitro conservation of Ipsea malabarica (Reichb. f.)

We suggest here that while prioritizing conservation areas in Northern Western Ghats, hill forts should be given a status of local biodiversity hotspots and conservation should be provided to all microhabitats that are natural as well as man-made. This will assure protection of endemic and threatened species of Western Ghats as well as local endemics of Northern Western Ghats.\\'hotspot, Tamil Nadu, India\\'Abstract: \\'This study highlights spatial characterization of evergreen forests of the Western Ghats an ecological hotspot in Tamil Nadu, India using remote sensing and GIS-based analysis in conjunction with ground-based phytosociological data. The evergreen forests of Tamil Nadu are distributed in four distinct hill ranges, Nilgiri, Anamalai, Palni and Tirunelveli, having different topographic, bioclimatic and disturbance levels. The evergreen forests in these four hill ranges are characterized for their uniqueness in terms of patch characteristics and phytosociology. A vegetation type map was prepared using IRS LISS III satellite data and was used to study the patch characteristics in terms of patch size, number, shape, porosity and landcover diversity (LD). The phytosociological characteristics, namely species richness, diversity, similarity and community assemblages, were studied using ground data collected from 95 sample points of 0.1 ha size. Patch size and number revealed distinct intactness and disturbance levels in these four hill ranges. Evergreen forests in the Tirunelveli hills comprising 216.09 km2 are distributed in 306 patches, and in the Palni hills, with 285 km2, forests are distributed in 1029 patches, indicating a high level of fragmentation. LD, indicating the spatial heterogeneity of landcover, was very high in the Nilgiri hills and low in the Tirunelveli hills. The spatial analysis helped to delineate homogenous large patches of evergreen forest, which can be adopted for appropriate conservation strategies. A total of 342 tree species belonging to 4490 stems were evaluated for phytosociology. Only of similarity in terms of species distribution was found across the hill ranges. Conjunctive analysis of patch characteristics and species distribution showed high species richness in less fragmented evergreen forests and vice versa. The study identified the areas of prioritization in terms of ecorestoration and conservation based on patch and phytosociological characteristics.\\'Abstract: \\'Seventy one fish species belonging to 27 families and 50 genera were collected from various sampling sites spread along the upstream and downstream parts of the Chalakudy river, in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in Kerala, South India. Cyprinids were the most dominant group represented by 24 species belonging to 13 genera, followed by the catfishes of the family Bagridae (7 species from 2 genera) and loaches belonging to the family Balitoridae (5 species from 5 genera). Of the 71 species, 4 belong to the (CR) and 16 to the (EN) category. 3 of the critically endangered species are strictly endemic to the Chalakudy river system. We also collected 5 exotic species several of them categorized as potential pest. Fish species richness (FSR) showed a direct relationship with increasing stream order with maximum values observed in the downstream/low elevation regions. Considerable differences were observed in the FSR between different microhabitats with maximum values observed in bed rock and pool riffle and the lowest in regimes followed by step pools. Diversity and species richness decreased with increasing altitude and higher diversity and species richness were observed in sampling sites located between above sea level. A definite temporal partitioning was also observed with regard to FSR with higher richness during the day time and the lowest observed at dawn. Indiscriminate collection of endemic and threatened ornamental fish species for export, exploitation of endangered food fishes by forest-dwelling communities and local fisher folk, pollution, loss of riparian cover, damming and exotic species threaten the rich ichthyofaunal diversity of Chalakudy River. An urgent need exists for studying the life history traits and demography of the most important endemic and threatened fishes, as lack of information on these aspects have significantly affected conservation efforts. The implementation of strong management strategies like fixing total allowable catch (TAC), and the use of quotas are needed to reduce the overall collection pressure with regard to the trade in native ornamental species from the river.\\'Abstract: \\'In order to understand the vegetative and reproductive phenological behaviour of Syzygium caryophyllatum, the knowledge of the factor influencing leaf flushing, maturation, leaf fall, flowering and fruiting of this tree species is required. The authors used field observations collected over at Neeliyarkottam sacred grove, Kannur district, Western Ghats of Kerala, India, to characterize the relationship between phenological pattern and biotic and abiotic (climatic) factors. The relationship between phenological pattern of the selected species and abiotic variables such as precipitation and temperature exhibited significant variation among the species. Flowering begins from second week of March to till May with a peak in April followed by the fruiting. Hand pollination tests indicated that most of the fruits were developed through xenogamous pollination. The breeding test results indicated S. caryophyllatum is self-incompatible and out-crossing is fertile. The foraging activities of some common pollinators on S. caryophyllatum flowers were also studied. The main flower visitors and foragers include honey bees, different varieties of butterflies, wasps, carpenter bees, small flies, bugs and ants. The flowering and fruiting exclusively occur in the dry season and are followed by germination and establishment of seedlings during the subsequent rainy season. The authors conclude that the investigations on the reproductive phenology, floral biology, breeding systems and pollinator visitation are important due to population survival of the species and its evolutionary success.\\'India\\'Abstract: \\' Decalepis arayalpathra, a critically endangered plant species, has a restricted and fragmented population in Southern Western Ghats, India. This study is a first attempt to evaluate genetic diversity and population structure in the nine wild populations of D. arayalpathra based on molecular pattern realized through the marker assays. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA)-based hierarchical clustering of both the marker assays suggest strong genetic clustering between the individuals corresponding to their geographical ranges. Mantel test also corroborates a close genetic proximity between genetic and geographic data Population genetic analysis revealed low levels of gene flow [inter-simple sequence repeat and random amplified polymorphic DNA between the populations, in line with high genetic differentiation with ISSR and 0.440 with RAPD), which was also supported by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), that (ISSR) and (RAPD) total variation resided within populations. Bayesian model-based STRUCTURE analysis detected three genetic clusters showing the high degree of admixture within population. Based on the findings, such as inbreeding depression and the loss of genetic diversity, suggestions for conservation strategies are provided to preserve the genetic resources of this endangered species.\\'Abstract: \\'Spatially explicit approach is essential to prioritise the ecosystems for biodiversity conservation. In the present study, the conservation status of 20 protected areas of the Western Ghats of Kerala, India, was analysed based on long-term changes in forests landscape level changes in fragmentation and forest fires This study has shown that a significant forest loss occurred in protected areas before declaration. Idukki is one of the major protected areas which showed a drastic reduction (18.83%) in its forest cover. During Periyar tiger reserve had lost core 3 forest area followed by Peppara Parambikulam Chimmony Peechi-Vazhani and Neyyar An area of of the protected area was affected by fires in 2014. Overall protected area-wise decadal analysis indicates Periyar has the highest number of fire incidences followed by Wayanad, Kurinjimala, Silent Valley and Eravikulam. Disturbances in the form of fires and fragmentation still exist and may have significant conservation threat to flora and fauna. Among protected areas, many are having a probability to go under threat or dynamic stage. Chinnar, Thattekkad and Kurinjimala sanctuaries are representing high levels of vulnerability, or they are near to decline stage. Habitat level monitoring of the anthropogenic disturbances can be efficiently useful for the strategic conservation planning. The present study has provided geospatial database on spatial patterns of deforestation, fragmentation and forest fires in protected areas of Kerala. Conservation prioritization approach based on these parameters will be useful for the strategic planning in the state of Kerala.\\'Abstract: \\'This study documents the distribution patterns, endemism and uniqueness (species richness) of fishes in the Tunga and Bhadra rivers of Western Ghats, India. We recorded 77 species represented by 7 orders, 16 families and 44 genera, of which 36 species are endemic to Western Ghats, 12 species endemic to India and 26 species endemic to the Indian Subcontinent. Based on our analysis on the distribution patterns, the Tunga River is richer in diversity and higher in endemism than the Bhadra. We calculated the similarity of the species composition among sites within these two rivers using the Jacquard index. The similarity index between the sampling sites of these rivers revealed that the similarity decreases with increasing distance between the sampling sites. Of the 77 fish species we collected, 8 species (11.1%) are in the Critical category, 10 species (13.8%) are in the High Risk category, 36 species (50%) are in the Moderate category and the remaining 18 species (25%) are at lower risk. The threat status of fishes found in the Tunga and Bhadra rivers strongly suggests the need for effective conservation measures to conserve the fish species richness of these rivers.\\'Abstract: \\'Climate change, alien species, and use of land for intensive farming and development are causing severe threat to the plant genetic diversity worldwide. Hence, conservation of biodiversity is considered fundamental and also provides the livelihoods to millions of people worldwide. Medicinal plants play a key role in the treatment of a number of diseases, and they are only the source of medicine for majority of people in the developing world. The tropical regions of the world supply the bulk of current global demand for albeit with increasing threat to populations in the world and its genetic diversity. India is a major center of origin and diversity of crop and medicinal plants. India poses out 20,000 species of higher plants, one third of it being endemic and 500 species are categorized to have medicinal value. The Western Ghats is one of the major repositories of medicinal plants. It harbors around 4,000 species of higher plants of which 450 species are threatened. Currently, the number of species added to the red list category in this region is increasing, and the valuable genetic resources are being lost at a rapid rate. Demand for medicinal plants is increasing, and this leads to unscrupulous collection from the wild and adulteration of supplies. Providing high-quality planting material for sustainable use and thereby saving the genetic diversity of plants in the wild is important. During the last of intensive research, Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute has developed in vitro protocol for rapid regeneration and establishment of about 40 medicinally important rare and threatened plants of Western Ghats. In situ conservation alone would not be effective in safeguarding these important species. Thus, utilizing the biotechnoligical approach to complement ex situ conservation program is becoming vital. Propagating biotechnology tools in plant conservation program is a prerequisite to succeed in sustainable use and to complement the existing ex situ measures. In addition to propagation, storage of these valuable genetic resources is equally important. In vitro slow growth of 35 species and cryopreservation using embryo/meristem/seed in 20 different species of rare medicinal plants of this region is accomplished. Plants developed in vitro of ten medicinal plants, which have restricted distribution, were reintroduced in the natural habitat as well.\\'Abstract: \\'The status of the endemic and endangered lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus) has not been properly assessed in several regions of the Western Ghats of southern India. We conducted a study in Parambikulam Forest Reserve in the state of Kerala to determine the distribution, demography, and status of lion-tailed macaques. We laid 5km2 grid cells on the map of the study area (644km2) and made four replicated walks in each grid cell using GPS. We gathered data on lion-tailed macaque group locations, demography, and site covariates including trail length, duration of walk, proportion of evergreen forest, height of tallest trees, and human disturbance index. We also performed occupancy modeling using PRESENCE ver. 3.0. We estimated a minimum of 17 groups of macaques in these hills. Low detection and occupancy probabilities indicated a low density of lion-tailed macaques in the study area. Height of the tallest trees correlated positively whereas human disturbance and proportion of evergreen forest correlated negatively with occupancy in grid cells. We also used data from earlier studies carried out in the surrounding Anamalai Tiger Reserve and Nelliyampathy Hills to discuss the conservation status in the large Anamalai Hills Landscape. This landscape harbors an estimated population of 1108 individuals of lion-tailed macaques, which is about one third of the entire estimated wild population of this species. A conservation plan for this landscape could be used as a model for conservation in other regions of the Western Ghats.\\'Abstract: \\' Coelogyne nervosa is an epiphytic orchid endemic to Western Ghats, South India. The mature seeds of C. nervosa were cultured on MS (Murashige and Skoog), MS, Kn (Knudson) and VW (Vacin and Went) media to evaluate the seed germination response. Of the four basal media used, MS medium supported maximum seed germination. Further experiments to enhance seed germination were done on MS medium supplemented with various concentrations (10, 20, 30 and of coconut water (CW). Thirty percent CW gave the highest response in terms of percent seed germination (96), fresh weight and protocorm length Since CW containing medium did not support further seedling growth, each seedling was isolated and cultured on MS medium supplemented with either BA (6-benzylaminopurine) or Kin (kinetin) alone each) or in combination with NAA (1-naphthaleneacetic acid; Maximum growth was observed on MS medium supplemented with BA and NAA On this medium, the seedlings reached an average length of with 2.8 well expanded green leaves per seedling. Similarly optimum, healthy, white root induction (3.3 roots/seedlings) was also observed on the same medium. The rooted seedlings were successfully transplanted to pots with success. The 2-year-old tissue culture derived plants produced normal flowers and fruits.\\'India\\'Abstract: \\'Understanding how different audience groups perceive wildlife is crucial for the promotion of biodiversity conservation, especially given the key role of flagship species in conservation campaigns. Although the heterogeneity in preferences reinforces the need for campaigns tailored to specific target audiences, many conservation education and awareness campaigns still claim to target the Audiences can be segmented according to social, economic, and cultural criteria across which species perceptions are known to vary. Different studies have investigated the preferences of different groups towards certain wildlife species, but these are largely confined to a single conservation stakeholder group, such as tourists, local communities, or potential donors in western countries. In this study, we seek to determine from a multi-stakeholder perspective, audience characteristics that influence perceptions towards wildlife at Valparai, a fragmented plateau in the Western Ghats region of the Western Ghats-Sri Lanka Hotspot. We found that stakeholder group membership was the most important characteristic followed by gender. While some characteristics had a wide-scale effect others were restricted to a few species. Our results emphasize the need to design conservation campaigns with specific audiences in mind, instead of the very often referred toAbstract: \\'Ecologically sensitive regions (ESRs) are the with the exceptional biotic and abiotic elements. Identification of ESRs considering spatially both ecological and social dimensions of environmental variables helps in ecological and conservation planning as per Biodiversity Act, 2002, Government of India. The current research attempts to integrate ecological and environmental considerations into administration, and prioritizes regions at Panchayat levels (local administrative unit) in Uttara Kannada district, Central Western Ghats, Karnataka state considering attributes (biological, Geo-climatic, Social, etc.) as ESR through weightage score metrics. The region has the distinction of having highest forest area (80.48%) in Karnataka State, India and has been undergoing severe anthropogenic pressures impacting biogeochemistry, hydrology, food security, climate and socio-economic systems. Prioritisation of ESRs helps in the implementation of the sustainable developmental framework with the appropriate conservation strategies through the involvement of local stakeholders.\\'Abstract: \\'As large nature reserves occupy only a fraction of the land surface, conservation biologists are critically examining the role of private lands, habitat fragments, and plantations for conservation. This study in a biodiversity hotspot and endemic bird area, the Western Ghats mountains of India, examined the effects of habitat structure, floristics, and adjacent habitats on bird communities in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and tropical rainforest fragments. Habitat and birds were sampled in 13 sites: six fragments (three relatively isolated and three with canopy connectivity with adjoining shade-coffee plantations and forests), six plantations differing in canopy tree species composition (five coffee and one cardamom), and one undisturbed primary rainforest control site in the Anamalai hills. Around 3300 detections of 6000 individual birds belonging to 106 species were obtained. The coffee plantations were poorer than rainforest in rainforest bird species, particularly endemic species, but the rustic cardamom plantation with diverse, native rainforest shade trees, had bird species richness and abundance comparable to primary rainforest. Plantations and fragments that adjoined habitats providing greater tree canopy connectivity supported more rainforest and fewer open-forest bird species and individuals than sites that lacked such connectivity. These effects were mediated by strong positive effects of vegetation structure, particularly woody plant variables, cane, and bamboo, on bird community structure. Bird community composition was however positively correlated only to floristic (tree species) composition of sites. The maintenance or restoration of habitat structure and (shade) tree species composition in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and rainforest fragments can aid in rainforest bird conservation in the regional landscape.\\'Abstract: \\'Conservation initiatives are designed to address threats to forests and biodiversity, often through partnerships with natural-resource users who are incentivized to change their land-use and livelihood practices to avoid further biodiversity loss. In particular, direct incentives programmes that provide monetary benefits are commended for being effective in achieving conservation across short timescales. In biodiversity-rich areas, outside protected areas, such as coffee agroforestry systems, direct incentives, such as certification schemes, are used to motivate coffee producers to maintain native tree species, natural vegetation, restrict wildlife hunting, and conserve soil and water, in addition to encouraging welfare of workers. However, despite these claims, there is a lack of strong evidence of the on-ground impact of such schemes. To assess the conservation importance of certification, we describe a case study in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot of India, in which coffee growers are provided price incentives to adopt Rainforest Alliance certification standards. We analyse the conservation and social outcomes of this programme by studying experiences of participating in certification. Despite high compliance and effective implementation, we find a strong case for the endorsement of as with no changes in farm management as a result of certification. We find that such as participation in certification creates grounds for diminishing credibility and local support for conservation efforts. Working towards locally relevant conservation interventions, rather than implementing global blueprints, may lead to more meaningful biodiversity conservation and increased community support for conservation initiatives in coffee landscapes.\\'Abstract: \\'The Western Ghats of India are known to be a major biological hotspot that supports plant diversity and the Kas Plateau, a lateritic plateau of the northern Western Ghats, we examined mesoscale distributions of endemic, rare, or locally significant plant species in forest habitats or on the plateau and its escarpments, and assessed the edaphic and hydrological parameters of seasonal plateau microhabitats.\\'Abstract: \\'Forest resource conservation has been widely accepted as a key to sustain the local and regional economic development. The forest edges are affected by anthropogenic activities including deforestation, forest fragmentation, selective logging, extraction of non-timber forest products, collection of medicinal plants, recreations, hydroelectric projects and its associated developmental activities, which alter the biodiversity. The present study intends to evaluate the edge effect on vegetation structure and species compositions in the tropical forest ecosystems at Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary in the Western Ghats. High species richness (number of species) and diversity indices were observed in the site III (completely undisturbed forest) compared to site I (adjacent to the village/ edge of the forest, which is next to the teak plantation, severely disturbed forest) and site II (in between the undisturbed forest and moderately disturbed forest) while density of tree species showed greater value in site II. Single species such as Tectona grandis (IVI of 80) and Terminalia paniculata (IVI of 112) were the dominant tree species in site I and site II, respectively, whereas, in site III Terminalia bellirica, Bishofia javanica and Syzgium gardneri shared the dominance. Perturbation leads to alien plant invasion particularly Lantana camara, Eupatorium odoratum and Ageratum conizoides. Site II is at forest transition level because the site is dominated by both natural species as well as plantation species such as Tectona grandis. This site seems to be a buffer zone on natural forest and plantations. Further studies are required to analyse the real patterns of regeneration and dynamic change due to human impact by long term monitoring with the establishment of permanent plots.\\'Abstract: \\'A majority of the research on forest fragmentation is primarily focused on animal groups rather than on tree communities because of the complex structural and functional behavior of the latter. In this study, we show that forest fragmentation provokes surprisingly rapid and profound alterations in tropical tree community. We examine forest fragments in the tropical region using high-resolution satellite imagery taken between 1973 and 2004 in the Southern Western Ghats (India) in relation to landscape patterns and phytosociological datasets. We have distinguished fragmentation in six perforated, edge, transitional, patch, and each forested pixel. Furthermore, we have characterized each of the fragment class in the evergreen and semi-evergreen forest in terms of its species composition and richness, its species similarity and abundance, and its regeneration status. Different landscape metrics have been used to infer patterns of land-use changes. Contiguous patches of covered 90% of evergreen forest in 1973 with less porosity and minimal plantation and anthropogenic pressures; whereas in 2004, the area had 67% forest coverage and a high level of porosity, possibly due to Ochlandra spread and increased plantations which resulted in the loss of such contiguous patches. Results highlight the importance of landscape metrics in monitoring land-cover change over time. Our main conclusion was to develop an approach, which combines information regarding land cover, degree of fragmentation, and phytosociological inputs, to conserve and prioritize tropical ecosystems.\\'Abstract: \\'Agroforestry in the Western Ghats (WG) of peninsular India and satoyama in rural Japan are traditional land-use systems with similar evolutionary trajectories. Some of their relevance was lost by the middle of the twentieth century, when modern agricultural technologies and urbanisation engineered shifts in emphasis towards maximising crop production. There has been, however, a resurgence of interest in traditional land-use systems recently, in view of their ability to provide ecosystem services. Both agroforestry and satoyama are thought to be harbingers of biological diversity and have the potential to serve as Carbon (C) stock estimates of the sampled homegardens in WG ranged from 16 to Satoyama woodlands owing to variations in tree stocking and management conditions indicated widely varying C stocks Agroforestry and satoyama also differ in nature, complexity, and objectives. While agroforestry involves key productive and protective functions, and adopts the satoyama woodlands are extensively managed; understorey production is seldom a consideration. Differences in canopy architecture (multi-tiered structure of agroforestry vs. the more or less unitary canopy of satoayama) and land ownership pattern (privately owned/managed agroforestry holdings vs. community or local government or privately owned and mostly abandoned satoyamas) pose other challenges in the transfer and application of knowledge gained in one system to the other. Nonetheless, lessons learnt from satoyama conservation may be suitable for common pool resource management elsewhere in Asia, and aspects relating to understorey production in agroforestry may be relevant for satoyama under certain scenarios.\\'Abstract: \\'The Mountains of the Western Ghats are the second most important shelter in the world for threatened species.

The present study was conducted to identify the rare, endangered and threatened climbing plants in Southern Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India.\\'Abstract: \\'Biodiversity and environmental conservation is important for critically degraded environment, so strategies must be developed using protected area networks such as biosphere reserves, wildlife sanctuaries and national parks. Kalakad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve is such a valuable repository of floral and faunal biodiversity in the southern Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India, both in terms of species richness and endemism. A survey was carried out from September 2004 to June 2006 to assess the conservation status of medicinal plants which are used by the tribal people inhabiting the periphery of the reserve. More than 350 species of ethnomedicinal plants were recorded in the study with the association of tribal practitioners. Out of them, the ethnomedicinal plants Aglaia lawii, Arenga wightii, Chloroxylon swietenia, Eugenia singampattiana, Kingiodendron pinnatum, Orophea thomsonii, Polyalthia rufescens, Pterocarpus marsupium and Santalum album are plants. The majority of the plants of the reserve are rapidly getting threatened, because of the natural calamities and anthropogenic activities inside the forest areas. Thus, the reserve has high conservation value and its biodiversity is vulnerable to different factors so its conservation should receive great attention by involving the local communities and forest representatives.\\'Abstract: \\'The Red Data Book of Indian Plants (RDB) is a reference manual that lists threatened angiosperms, gymnosperms and pterydophytes. Because it is widely used study is an attempt to cross-check the listings in the RDB using vegetation inventories and another reference manual, the Atlas of Endemics of the Western Ghats, India []. Field inventories across the Western Ghats gave an estimate of the species relative abundances and the Atlas provided quantitative information on the number of records for the endemic species in herbaria, literature, and during field surveys. The results of this analysis indicate that the RDB and the Atlas agree statistically regarding the conservation status of endemic trees. However, the proportion of threatened species per Atlas record category behaves erratically, indicating that some threatened endemic trees are not listed in the RDB. Our results suggest that the status of threatened plant species should be reexamined on a priority basis using quantitative methodology. An updating of the RDB is urgently needed, particularly for the endemic plants of the Western Ghats. We provide a list of species that are likely to be threatened, yet are not listed.\\'protected areas serve as refugia for genetic resources of economically important plants?\\'Abstract: \\'Given the increasing anthropogenic pressures on forests, the various protected parks, sanctuaries, and biosphere as the last footholds for conserving biological diversity. However, because protected areas are often targeted for the conservation of selected species, particularly charismatic animals, concerns have been raised about their effectiveness in conserving nontarget taxa and their genetic resources. In this paper, we evaluate whether protected areas can serve as refugia for genetic resources of economically important plants that are threatened due to extraction pressures. We examine the population structure and genetic diversity of an economically important rattan, Calamus thwaitesii, in the core, buffer and peripheral regions of three protected areas in the central Western Ghats, southern India. Our results indicate that in all the three protected areas, the core and buffer regions maintain a better population structure, as well as higher genetic diversity, than the peripheral regions of the protected area. Thus, despite the escalating pressures of extraction, the protected areas are effective in conserving the genetic resources of rattan. These results underscore the importance of protected areas in conservation of nontarget species and emphasize the need to further strengthen the protected-area network to offer refugia for economically important plant species.\\'Abstract: \\'Fragmentation leads to the loss of connectivity among forested landscapes, which is important for biological conservation and biodiversity maintenance. Fragmentation analysis carried out on 20 years time interval in northern-Western Ghats revealed that, losses under moderate and high fragmented forests have decreased from to 2005; however, it is not enough to compensate the loss of intact forests (not fragmented). The area of dense forests in intact forests has decreased from to 2005, this essentially means the loss of quality habitat in the area. While investigating connectivity between fragmented patches by taking different topographical and ecological parameters into the consideration, it was observed that potential connectivity exists between protected areas present in northern and southern areas.\\'Abstract: \\'Species diversity, density, population structure and dispersion patterns of all trees and lianas gbh) were inventoried in a tropical semi-evergreen forest in the Shervarayan hills of Eastern Ghats, south India. Such data are necessary for ecosystem conservation of the under-studied Eastern Ghats, as extensive forests here have already been converted to coffee and orange plantations and the landscape changed due to aluminium ore mining and quarrying. Four 1-ha plots were established in Sanyasimalai (SM) reserve forest of the Shervarayan hills, one plot (SM1) located close to mining and quarrying area, two other contiguous plots (SM2 and SM3) located in selective felling area and the fourth (SM4) in a relatively undisturbed forest. These are 1 to 4km apart in the same semi-evergreen forest tract. In the four study plots a total of 3260 stems (mean density covering 80 species in 71 genera and 44 plant families were recorded. Species richness was greatest in the undisturbed plot SM4 (50), while lowest (33) in the selectively felled site SM2. The forest stand (SM4) was also denser (986 and more voluminous (basal area as compared with the site mean of than the other plots. Four trees, Chionanthus paniculata, Syzygium cumini, Canthium dicoccum and Ligustrum perrottetii dominated the stand, collectively contributing to >50% of the total density. Species richness and stand density decreased with increasing tree girths. The forest stand contained a growing population, but there was considerable variation in basal area distribution between the plots. Trends in species population structure varied, particularly for selective-felled species. Most species exhibited clumped dispersion of individuals both at 0.25ha and 1-ha scales. Variation in plant diversity and abundance are related to site attributes and human impacts.\\'Abstract: \\'We analyze the structure and composition of old-growth wet evergreen forest of Nelliampathy hills, the chain of hills lying immediately south of Palghat Gap, in the southern Western Ghats of India. We sampled 30 plots of 0.1 ha each (50 m 20 m) at six locations enumerating all plants 10 cm girth at breast height. We pooled the data and computed various structural parameters. There were 152 species of 120 genera and 51 families of the study area. Of these, 118 (77%) were trees, 24 were climbers (16%) and 10 were shrubs (7%). Species richness varied from per 0.5 ha sample and Shannon indices of diversity ranged from 4.4 to 5.2. Fifty-nine per cent (89 species) of the species were Indian Sub-continent elements and 34% (51 species) are endemic to the Western Ghats. Fifteen species are listed in various threat categories. Aglaia and Litsea were the most species-rich genera. Numbers of families ranged from per 0.5 ha sample. Euphorbiaceae and Lauraceae were the most species-rich families. Stand density varied from 1714 to 2244 and basal area from 53.6 to 102.1 The vegetation was dominated by species and six dominance patterns characterized the species composition within the hill complex. The old-growth evergreen forests of Nelliampathy exist as small fragments rich in biodiversity and can be used as benchmarks for comparison with disturbed forests.\\'Abstract: \\'A beautiful monocarpic palm of the Western Ghats, talipot which through the ages played a silent role in the culture, economy and ecology especially of the west coast of South India, is facing an uncertain future mainly due to negligence. Much could be done to bring back this palm from obscurity into the mainstream of conservation.\\'Abstract: \\'There are thousands of protected forest areas existing on earth, yet the deforestation rate continues unabated both inside and outside the protected areas especially in the tropical forests. It identifies the less effectiveness of the current conservation strategies, which is normally oriented around the forest area cover rather than the quality of the protected areas. This calls for realistic and effective management strategies for forests. Based on the drawbacks the present study aims at identifying conservation priority sites within the protected areas (Reserved Forests) of Shervarayan hills, Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India. The remnant forest patches having less effective management/protection is identified and analysed for its qualitative contribution to the ecosystem. Quadrats of were laid in different vegetation based on the percentage of forest cover and assess the species diversity pertaining the richness, Endemism and Red list categories. Thematic layers (maps) such as vegetation type, floristic species richness, floristic endemism, and red list flora are created and categorized according to their weightage classes and overlaid in GIS domain to demarcate the Conservation Priority Zones (CPZ). The CPZ are classified according to the priority status i.e., high, moderate and low based on the contributing species richness, levels of endemism and concentration of Red listed plants.\\'Abstract: \\'Sacred areas are the oldest form of habitat protection, and many of these areas contribute to biodiversity conservation. While sacred groves have received considerable scholarly attention, little is known about fresh water swamps in the Western Ghats, India and sacred swamps have largely been ignored. This paper provides a first overview testing the conjecture that sacred swamps have physical features that distinguish them from non-sacred swamps. We assessed 110 fresh water swamps in the district of Uttara Kannada, Central Western Ghats, India, through extensive field surveys. Out of them 11 swamps are according to local testimony. Swamps are found in wet evergreen and evergreen forest types, but sacred swamps occur only in the wet evergreen forests. Sacred swamps differ significantly from non-sacred swamps with respect to size and shape, distance to the nearest road, human settlement, and commercial orchard, and population density within a radius of This shows that preferentially swamps close to settlements, orchards and roads have been declared as sacred, probably to regulate the continuing provision of relevant ecosystem services. While we find a variety of deities associated with these sacred swamps, the practices associated with sacred swamp status and management are essentially the same across belief groups. However, the conservation practice is at risk due to migration dynamics.\\'Abstract: \"We examined species turnover in stream amphibians in rainforest in two hill ranges (Ashambu and Anamalai Hills) in the Western Ghats in south India. In each hill range, six stream segments in length) belonging to three drainage or rivers were surveyed three to four times in three seasons over Species turnover (using 1-Sorenson\\'s index) was estimated between all possible pairs of sites at three spatial scales within drainage, between drainage and between hill ranges. Similar matrices were also developed for altitudinal difference and geographic distance between sites. A total of 30 species in four families were recorded from 3681 individuals. The hill ranges differed significantly in the composition of the stream community at both the species and family levels. Within the hill range, species turnover was correlated with altitudinal difference and not with geographic distance. Anamalai Hills had a greater species turnover than Ashambu Hills, both within and between drainage. There was also a high turnover between these two hill ranges, with only two shared species. This turnover explains the fact that only species have been reported from different hill ranges, although regional diversity is high with about 130 species. The turnover also predicts that several undetected species should occur in hill ranges and drainage that have not been surveyed. The conservation model for mammals and birds, consisting of a few large protected areas, may not adequately address the conservation requirements of amphibians. Protection of rainforest frogs may require many protected areas in different drainages.\"Abstract: \\'Decades of commercial planting and other anthropogenic processes are posing a threat to the riparian landscapes of the Cauvery river basin, which supports a high floral diversity. Despite this, the habitats in the upstream sections of the River Cauvery are still intact, as they are located in sacred groves. To understand the dynamism of riparian forests exposed to anthropogenic pressures, the upstream stretch of Cauvery extending from Kushalanagara to Talacauvery km) was categorized into two landscapes: agro ecosystem and sacred (i.e. preserved). The tree species were sampled using belt transects at 5 km intervals and the regeneration status of endemic species assessed using quadrats. A total of 128 species belonging to 47 families, and representing 1,590 individuals, was observed. Amongst them, 65% of unique species were exclusive to sacred landscapes. A rarefaction plot confirmed higher species richness for the sacred compared to the agro ecosystem landscapes, and diversity indices with more evenness in distribution were evident in sacred landscapes. A significant loss of endemic tree species in the agro ecosystem landscapes was found. Overall, this study demonstrates that an intense biotic pressure in terms of plantations and other anthropogenic activities have altered the species composition of the riparian zone in non-sacred areas. A permanent policy implication is required for the conservation of riparian buffers to avoid further ecosystem degradation and loss of biodiversity.\\'Abstract: agroforestry is a conservation strategy that has shown promise to support the diversity of bird, bat, and insect communities, but few studies have focused on non-volant mammals in coffee farms. We assessed mammal diversity within coffee agroforestry systems in Kodagu, India and investigated the impacts of the non-native shade tree species, Grevillea robusta, on mammal diversity. Twenty farms, with varying amounts of G. robusta planted within the coffee farm, were sampled throughout three rainfall zones during the 4-month study period. We captured six species of small mammals, with indirect methods yielding an additional five species, totaling species. Contrary to current ecological thought, we found that increased amounts of G. robusta did not have a negative impact on either abundance or richness of mammals. Small mammal abundances were higher at farms with greater amounts of herbaceous ground cover and larger, mature shade trees, while small mammal species richness was found to increase with an increase in tree species richness as well as greater amounts of herbaceous ground cover. Additionally, small mammal abundance was higher at coffee farms closer to forested areas. Based on these findings, we suggest the maintenance or cultivation of shade tree richness, mature shade trees, and herbaceous ground cover within coffee farms and preservation of forested areas within the landscape to enhance coffee agroforestry habitat for non-volant mammals. We hope that these habitat requirements will be incorporated into conservation strategies for the promotion of biodiversity within coffee agroforestry systems.\\'Abstract: \\'The composition, abundance, population structure and distribution patterns of all woody species 30 cm gbh) were investigated in an undisturbed and two adjacent human-impacted sites of a tropical wet evergreen forest in Kalakad National Park, Western Ghats, south India. Three 1-ha plots were established, one each in (i) an undisturbed site (named site UD), (ii) in a site selectively felled 35 years ago (site SF small stems felled leaving the large trees (as shade) for developing it into a cardamom estate, on the failure of which the site was abandoned) and (iii) a frequently disturbed site (site FD round woods logged for use in ovens for curing cardamom). These sites are 1 to 3 km apart in the same wet evergreen forest. In the three study plots a total of 2150 stems (mean density 716 covering 122 species in 89 genera and 41 families were enumerated. Species richness was greatest (85 species in the undisturbed site UD, intermediate (83) in SF and lowest (80) in FD. Tree density was greatest (855 stems in site SF, intermediate (720) in UD and lowest (575) in FD. The forest stand was exceptionally voluminous in site UD (basal area 94.64 m2 intermediate (66.9 m2) in SF and least (61.7 m2) in FD, due to tree removal for fuel in the latter sites. Species composition and abundance patterns markedly varied between the three sites. In UD and SF, primary forest species (Cryptocarya bourdillonii , Cullenia exarillata Myristica dactyloides etc.) occurred in greater density. In FD heliophilic secondary forest species (Elaeocarpus venustus, Litsea wightiana, Viburnum punctatum and Vitex altissima) were abundant, while these were absent in UD and SF. The curve did not reach an asymptote in any of the sites on the 1-ha scale. The stand population structure was clearly reverse shaped in UD and SF, while small stems were 2- to 3-fold fewer in FD. Most trees exhibited clumped distribution of individuals on the 1-ha scale. Variation in the kind and richness of species and their abundance is related to human interference and the need for forest conservation is emphasized.\\'Abstract: \"Ecology of Asia\\'s smallest ungulate, the Indian chevrotain or mouse deer (Moschiola indica), has been poorly assessed. We used camera-trapping data to investigate habitat use of mouse deer in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. Presence/absence data, collected under a systematic sampling framework, were used to test a priori hypotheses incorporating covariates believed to influence mouse deer occurrence and detection. The average occupancy rate of mouse deer in the study area was 0.56 with a low detection probability (0.29, Model selection indicated that presence of moist bamboo brakes positively influenced while percent leaf litter negatively influenced mouse deer occupancy. Placement of camera-traps along narrow trails positively influenced detection probability of mouse deer. Future conservation efforts in India should focus on preservation of bamboo vegetation and dense forest cover which provide refuge for the mouse deer. Our results illustrate that occupancy can be suitable for monitoring elusive, forest dwelling, small ungulates; however, caution is needed when applying these models on small ranging species, as our study identifies the limitations in our survey design and its improvement for future monitoring which are applicable for similar-sized species across a range of habitats.\"Abstract: \\'A permanent plot of 30 ha (600 500 m2) was established for long-term ecological research on biodiversity and forest functioning in a tropical evergreen forest at Varagalaiar, Anamalais, Western Ghats. This paper gives the results of the first census of trees in the 30 ha plot. All trees cm gbh were permanently tagged with sequentially numbered aluminium tags and their girth measured. 148 tree species (in 120 genera and 49 families) were enumerated in a total sample of 13,393 individuals. Species diversity, density and dispersion patterns were determined. The mean species richness, density and basal area per hectare were 65 species, 446 stems and 36.26 m2 respectively. The Sorensen similarity index for thirty 1-ha subplots varied from 0.7 to 0.9, indicating the homogeneity in species composition of the stand. The pronounced species hierarchy has resulted in the dominance of four species that occupy four different forest storeys: Drypetes longifolia (lower storey) Reinwardtiodendron anamallayanum (middle storey), Poeciloneuron indicum (upper storey) and Dipterocarpus indicus (emergent). The forest was dominated by Euphorbiaceae in terms of richness (18 species) and abundance of species (3788 stems), and Dipterocarpaceae based on the contribution to basal area (18.4%). Species richness and density decreased with increasing girth-class. Girth class frequency of the stand exhibited an expanding population of trees. Twenty-nine tree species, analysed for spatial dispersion at 1-ha scale, exhibited both clumped and uniform patterns, except Vateria indica which was randomly distributed in one hectare. Repeat census scheduled for subsequent years, will elucidate the behaviour of the individual species and the population dynamics of the tree flora and will be useful for forest conservation and management. It will also help to monitor human activity within this forest.\\'Abstract: \\'Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) has been used in combination with remote sensing and GIS techniques to assess the spatial pattern and annual rate of soil erosion in the Munnar Forest Division in Western Ghats, Kerala, India. The RUSLE takes into account several factors such as rainfall, soil erodibility, slope length and steepness, land cover and erosion control practice for soil erosion prediction. Maximum soil loss of and the areas with extreme erosion (erosion is higher than are confined to 11.46% of the total area, while the area occupied by severe erosion (erosion rate between 25 and is 27.53%. The high rate of annual soil erosion is associated with areas of high terrain alteration from the plantation activities and highly elevated hills/plateau margins with steep side slopes. Such an output is highly useful in decision making context to avoid land acquisition in erosion risk areas, or, alternatively, to recommend soil conservation measures to reduce soil loss, if developmental activities are to be continued at high soil erosion risk areas.\\'Abstract: \\'Saraca asoca (Roxb.) De Wilde is a valuable tree used in traditional medicine against a variety of ailments. Almost all parts of the tree are used for various commercial herbal preparations. Due to overexploitation, the species is rapidly disappearing from Western Ghats where it is native and grew extensively until recently. Conservation of this important medicinal plant is therefore an urgent need. To plan effective conservation strategies, a scientific assessment of the genetic diversity and distribution is needed.\\'Abstract: \\'Understanding of biodiversity on a local scale is extremely important for effective conservation measures, especially in biodiversity hotpsots hosting diverse endemic flora and fauna and subject to strong anthropogenic influences. Little is known about patterns of local biodiversity and the processes generating it in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot: the patterns of genetic diversity and biogeographic affinities are poorly known for most of the species from this region. We studied the genetic diversity and population structuring of an endemic frog Indirana cf beddomii, from 12 localities of Western Ghats using 15 polymorphic microsatellite loci. The genetic diversity as measured by mean expected heterozygosity (H or allelic richness (A was high and similar in all localities. Significant genetic differentiation (mean F with a strong pattern of isolation by distance (IBD) across the localities was observed. Clearest genetic discontinuities in the data corresponded to topographic gaps suggesting that apart from IBD, genetic structuring in this species is strongly influenced by habitat matrix. In general, the results provide novel insight into factors that may impact the genetic diversity and population structuring of endemic amphibians in this biodiversity hotspot.\\'Abstract: \\'Deforestation in the biosphere reserves, which are key Protected Areas has negative impacts on biodiversity, climate, carbon fluxes and livelihoods. Comprehensive study of deforestation in biosphere reserves is required to assess the impact of the management effectiveness. This article assesses the changes in forest cover in various zones and protected areas of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the first declared biosphere reserve in India which forms part of Western Ghats-a global biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we have mapped the forests from earliest available topographical maps and multi-temporal satellite data spanning from to 2012 period. Mapping of spatial extent of forest cover, vegetation types and land cover was carried out using visual interpretation technique. A grid cell of was generated for time series change analysis to understand the patterns in spatial distribution of forest cover The total forest area of biosphere reserve was found to be of total geographical area) in 1920. Overall loss of forest cover was estimated as of the total forest) with reference to 1920. Among the six Protected Areas, annual deforestation rate of >0.5 was found in Wayanad wildlife sanctuary during The deforestation in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve is mainly attributed to conversion of forests to plantations and agriculture along with submergence due to construction of dams during 1920 to 1989. Grid wise analysis indicates that 851 grids have undergone large-scale negative changes of of forest loss during while, only 15 grids have shown loss during Annual net rate of deforestation for the period of 1920 to 1973 was calculated as 0.5 followed by 0.1 for 1973 to 1989. Our analysis shows that there was large-scale deforestation before the declaration of area as biosphere reserve in 1986; however, the deforestation has drastically reduced after the declaration due to high degree of protection, thus indicating the secure future of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve with immediate applications in monitoring and management of forest biodiversity.\\'Abstract: \\'Expansion of coffee cultivation is one of the causes of deforestation and biodiversity loss. However, shade grown coffee has been promoted as a means for preserving biodiversity in the tropics. In this study we compared tree diversity in two types of coffee management regimes with the sacred groves in the Western Ghats of India. We computed species accumulation curves, species diversity indices and evenness indices to compare the different management regimes. Results of diversity indices showed that shade coffee had less diversity compared to sacred groves. Exotic species dominated the tree diversity in lands where the tree harvesting rights are with the growers. Native trees dominated the tree diversity when growers had no ownership rights on trees. A species accumulation curve suggested that the sacred grove had higher species richness compared to other two habitats. Lack of incentive to preserve endemic species as shade trees is forcing growers to plant more exotic species in shade grown coffee plots. If encouraged, shade grown coffee can preserve some biodiversity, but cannot provide all ecological benefits of a natural forest.\\'Abstract: \\'A new species of Justicia L. (Acanthaceae), J. sivadasanii Sunil, K. M. P. Kumar & Naveen Kum., from the Western Ghats of India is described and illustrated. Its IUCN status, distribution and phenology are provided along with colour photographs, and its affinities are discussed.\\'Abstract: \\' Ceropegia fantastica L. (Asclepiadaceae) is a highly endemic and endangered species in the Western Ghats of India. Fourteen microsatellite markers were developed for C. fantastica. Eight microsatellite primers screened had alleles per locus and the observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.48 to 0.83 and 0.48 to 0.62, respectively. The primers were also evaluated for their cross amplification against two related species Ceropegia hirsuta and Ceropegia oculata. The microsatellites developed for this species could be used for addressing population genetics of this endemic and critically endangered species.\\'Abstract: \\'Equatorial rain forests that maintain a balance between speciation and extinction are hot-spots for studies of biodiversity. Western Ghats in southern India have gained attention due to high tropical biodiversity and endemism in their southern most area. We attempted to track the affinities of the pollen flora of the endemic plants of Western Ghat area within the fossil palynoflora of late Palaeocene-early Eocene Ma) sedimentary deposits of western and northeastern Indian region. The study shows striking similarity of extant pollen with twenty eight most common fossil pollen taxa of the early Palaeogene. Widespread occurrences of coal and lignite deposits during early Palaeogene provide evidence of existence of well diversified rain forest community and swampy vegetation in the coastal low lying areas all along the western and northeastern margins of the Indian subcontinent. Prevalence of excessive humid climate during this period has been seen as a result of equatorial positioning of Indian subcontinent, superimposed by a long term global warming phase (PETM and EECO) during the early Palaeogene. The study presents clear evidence that highly diversified equatorial rain forest vegetation once widespread in the Indian subcontinent during early Palaeogene times, are now restricted in a small area as a refugia in the southernmost part of the Western Ghat area. High precipitation and shorter periods of dry months seem to have provided suitable environment to sustain lineages of ancient tropical vegetation in this area of Western Ghats in spite of dramatic climatic changes subsequent to the post India-Asia collision and during the Quaternary and Recent times.\\'Abstract: \\'Changes in tree and understory plant diversity and community composition in two sites at different disturbance levels were studied on the Anaikatty hills, Western Ghats. Systematic sampling using small scale permanent quadrates (50 for trees, 5 for shrubs/saplings, 1 for herbs/seedlings) enumerated 3,376 individuals of trees (106 species), 8,599 of individuals shrubs (122 species) and 16,659 individuals of herbs (145 species). Among the two sites, species richness and diversity were highest for low disturbed stand (98 and 3.9, respectively) compared to high disturbed site (45 and 2.71, respectively). Result of cluster analysis showed that two distinct clusters were formed on the basis of disturbance of the area in concordance with our field observation. A total of 37 species were common to both sites, sixty one species exclusively found in low disturbed site and eight species were pertained to highly disturbed site. test based on Monte Carlo approximation at 95% confidence levels indicated that both populations were not entirely different. The clear difference was only observed for average basal area of trees, density of seedlings, number of species, density and diversity for shrubs and number of species and diversity for herb. The species composition were different in two stand i.e., Nothopegia neilghrrensis in low disturbed stand and Albizia racemosa in high disturbed stand. The major disturbance factors identification using spearman rank correlation indicated that the disturbance in low disturbed habitats were mostly from past logging followed by cutting and illicit felling and grazing, while in high disturbed habitats, it was human presence, past logging and lopping and fuel wood collection.\\'Abstract: \\'While the conservation impacts of invasive plant species on tropical biodiversity is widely recognised, little is known of the potential for cultivated crops turning invasive in tropical forest regions. In the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, India, fragmented rainforests often adjoin coffee plantations. This study in the Anamalai hills assessed the effects of distance from edges and forest structure on the occurrence and abundance of shade-tolerant coffee (Arabica Coffea arabica and Robusta C. canephora) in four fragments using replicate line transects laid from the edges into the interiors. The coffee species cultivated in adjoining plantations was more abundant than the other coffee species inside study fragments, showing a clear decline in stem density from edge to interior suggesting the influence of propagule pressure of adjoining plantations, coupled with edge effects and seed dispersal by animals. Significant positive correlations of coffee density with canopy cover indicate the potential threat of coffee invasion even in closed canopy rainforests. Stem density of Coffea arabica was higher in more disturbed fragments, whereas Coffea canephora had spread in disturbed and undisturbed sites achieving much higher densities In addition, a negative relationship between C. canephora and native shrub density indicates its potential detrimental effects on native plants.\\'Abstract: \\'The main objective of this study is to integrate satellite derived forest burnt areas over a multi-decadal scale to understand fire frequencies in Silent Valley National Park, Kerala, India. There are nine vegetation types distinguished i.e. wet evergreen forest, shola, semi evergreen forest, moist deciduous forest, dry deciduous forest, savannah, reed brakes, scrub and grasslands using Resoursesat-2 LISS III data. The spatial extent of burnt area found to be highly varying and has been estimated as in 1973, in 1985, in 1989, in 1990, in 1994, in 1996 and in 1999. Analysis of burnt area coverage for recent decade based on 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 reveals fire affected area as 8.10, 4.20, 12.21, 5.52, 3.19, 0.62, 1.81, 2.03, 3.00 and area respectively. Spatial analysis indicates, an area of of total vegetation cover) affected by varying frequencies of fires from 1973 to 2014. High frequencies of fires have been observed in dry deciduous forests and grasslands. Buffer zone of national park has undergone frequent fires which may degrade climax forest vegetation and affects the regeneration and adaptability of indigenous species. Spatial tracking reveals grid cells were affected by forest fires. Overall, there is a declining trend of forest fires indicates management effectiveness in Silent Valley National Park.\\'Abstract: \\'We have used data generated using remote sensing and geographical information systems to categorize habitats, and then determined the relationship between the habitat categorizations and species-distribution patterns. A biologically rich Tiger Reserve, located at Southern Western Ghats, India, was chosen for this study. In order to spatially delineate areas of high species richness/diversity and endemic habitat zones, we have identified evergreen habitats in conjunction with landscape metrics, species assemblage, micro-habitats like slope, topography, species endemism, and proportion of core and edge species. A total of 236 species and 2,920 individuals were recorded using systematic stratified plots of covering 47 plots. Hierarchical cluster analysis was done using method. Plot information was used to identify clusters based on species density. The analysis showed five species assemblages that are quite distinct from each other in terms of dominant species. The distribution of endemic and edge species, land cover heterogeneity, and continuity of patches in these clusters were evaluated to understand the degree of disturbance and intactness at landscape scale. Integration of species assemblages and topography brought out four major elevation-slope complexes. Information on species composition (robust field survey) with spectral (hybrid classification) properties has shown 72% overall accuracy and distinguished four evergreen sub-groups and other land cover classes. The developed approach assumes great importance in the assessment of biodiversity and prioritizing the areas of conservation.\\'Abstract: \\'Assessing the distribution, abundance and demographic ratios of endangered and elusive co-occurring carnivore species at a landscape level is important for their continued survival. Despite potential to determine distribution and dietary analyses, use of faecal samples has been relatively limited in the context of multiple sympatric species living at large landscapes. We developed and optimized a range of novel non-invasive molecular techniques for species, gender and individual identification of tiger (Panthera tigris) and leopard (Panthera pardus). We collected a large number of faecal samples as part of a pilot occupancy survey in the Malenad-Mysore Tiger Landscape, Western Ghats, India. We could genetically ascertain species and gender for 88 and of the field-collected samples respectively. Additionally, we also determined a panel of nine and eight polymorphic loci for tiger and leopard individual identification, resulting in 18 tigers and 39 leopards from varied quality field-collected samples. Our pilot study suggest such molecular approaches will help in future efforts to gather landscape level distribution, demographic and other ecological information on tigers and leopards across their distribution.\\'Abstract: \\' Coscinium fenestratum is a critically endangered medicinal plant, well-known for its bioactive isoquinoline alkaloid berberine. The species has been over harvested from its natural habitats to meet the huge requirement of raw drug market and industrial consumption. This has lead to a rapid decline in the population size and has also led to local population extinction at few locations in the Western Ghats, India. In this study, inter-simple sequence repeat markers were used to investigate the genetic variation and population structure of seven extant populations of C. fenestratum from the central Western Ghats, India. Eight primer combination produced a total of 57 unambiguous bands, of which were polymorphic. The species exhibited a moderate to low level of intra population genetic diversity (H H (POPGENE) and H H (HICKORY)). The populations were low to moderately differentiated from one another (G and geographical distance was not significantly correlated with genetic distance, suggesting that these long-lived, geographically distant remnant populations were once connected through gene flow. There was a significant amount of genetic variation among populations The Bayesian software STRUCTURE and HICKORY were used to further reveal the genetic structure of C. fenestratum. The results revealed weak population structure with one single widespread gene pool, and indicated that gene flow and inbreeding are likely to be the major driving force in shaping current population genetic structure of C. fenestratum. Thus, an understanding of the genetic diversity and population structure of C. fenestratum can provide insight into the conservation and management of this species.\\'Abstract: \\'In the Western Ghats of India, amphibians are culled at cardamom plantations since they are perceived to consume cardamom. To better understand the relationship between amphibians and cardamom, a study was undertaken at these plantations, which harbor numerous threatened and range-restricted amphibians. We undertook questionnaire surveys with 298 respondents at 148 plantations across southern India. Time-activity budget and diet analysis surveys were undertaken to determine whether amphibians really consumed cardamom. The conception that amphibians eat cardamom was found to be widespread especially among small-sized plantations, leading to negative perceptions and a lack of interest in amphibian conservation. The plantation community perceives a substantial economic loss due to amphibians, even though this is non-existent as revealed by our field surveys. These perceptions would lead to a continued intolerance of amphibian presence in plantations. A suitable outreach initiative re-affirming facts and spreading awareness on the positive role of amphibians would need to be conducted to negate this age-old myth.\\'Abstract: \\'Rural people in developing countries including India continue to access a number of types of to meet specific needs such as fuelwood, fodder, food, non-timber forest produce and timber for both subsistence and income generation. While a plethora of terms exist to describe the types of forests that rural people as farm forests, social forests, community forests and small-scale expression domestic forest has recently been proposed. Domestic forest is a term aimed at capturing the diversity of forests transformed and managed by rural communities and a way to introduce a new scientific domain that recognises that production and conservation can be reconciled and that local communities can be effective managers. This paper argues in the context of the central Western Ghats of south India that while the domestic forest concept is a useful umbrella term to capture the diversity of forests used by rural people, these domestic forests are often not autonomous local forests but sites of contestation between local actors and the state forest bureaucracy. Hence, a paradigm shift within the forest bureaucracy will only occur if the scientific forestry community questions its own normative views on forest management and sees forest policy as a means to recognise local claims and support existing practices of forest dependent communities.\\'Abstract: \\' Summary. Rhynchospora panduranganii Viji, Shaju & Geetha Kum., a new species from the Western Ghats occurring within the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve is described and illustrated. The species is similar to the American R. scutellata Griseb., but differs by its more robust nature, much wider leaf blades, congested and more numerous spikelets per inflorescence, and larger achenes.\\'Abstract: \\'Detailed karyotypic studies have been done in two critically endangered and endemic Crinum species viz. C. brachynema Herb. and C. woodrowii Baker, which belong to two ploidy levels 2x and 4x respectively. The mean chromosome length (MCL) for C. brachynema and C. woodrowii is more or less same. Both the species fall under 3b category of Stebbins classification and exhibit moderately symmetrical karyotype. The similarity in chromosome morphology is in contrast with the marked phenotypic differences exhibited by these two species which in fact belong to two different sections. As these species are under tremendous anthropogenic influence, this communication is an attempt to provide basic chromosome data on these species with the aim that this data can be useful in future breeding work as Crinums have great ornamental potential. This may finally help in domestication of these neglected species and will ultimately lead to their conservation.\\'Abstract: \\'In this brief report, the relative importance of different climatic variables on structuring the spatial richness patterns of endemic tree species are quantified for Western Ghats of India, a biodiversity hotspot of the world. Path analysis and spatial multiple regression analysis are employed to measure the relative impacts of different climatic variables on the richness of tree species. Four climatic predictors, annual mean temperature (TEM), annual mean precipitation (PREC), annual evapotranspiration (AET), and elevation range (TOPO), are used to represent different perspectives of climatic variability. TEM represents temperature tolerance, PREC water availability, AET energy and TOPO habitat heterogeneity. Results show that, without removing spatial autocorrelation, AET is the most influential variable. However, the effect of AET was detected to be an artifact of spatial autocorrelation and after controlling such a misleading effect using simultaneous autoregressive models, the effects of other variables became evident and important in explaining the richness of endemic trees. All the statistical models consistently identified that TOPO and PREC are the equally influential variables for structuring richness patterns of endemic trees in Western Ghats. In conclusion, habitat heterogeneity and water availability are the most important predictors of richness in tropical endemic tree communities in Western Ghats.\\'Abstract: \\'For successful cultivation and conservation of plants a detailed knowledge of their reproductive biology is required. The reproductive features of trees are important to determine the diversity patterns and community structure of tropical forests. The present study on reproductive biology of Pittosporum dasycaulon, a rare medicinal tree, was conducted in the shola forests of Vaghamon hills, one of the foot hills of Southern Western Ghats of India fromAbstract: \\'The Western Ghats forms an important watershed for the entire peninsular India, being the source of 37 west flowing rivers and three major east flowing rivers and their numerous tributaries. However, deforestation due to large scale land cover changes has affected the water sustenance in the region evident from the quantity and duration of water availability during post monsoon period. Land use Land cover changes accelerated by unplanned anthropogenic activities have been the prime mover of global warming and consequent changes in the climate. This necessitates appropriate resource management with an understanding of drivers. Geo-visualization of landscape transitions considering the influential agents will aid in formulating strategies to mitigate global warming. Uttara Kannada district in the Central Western Ghats has the distinction of having highest forest cover in the country and this region is now experiencing rapid forest cover changes. Factors inducing changes in the land cover are normalized through fuzzyfication, considered for Multi criteria Evaluation using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) under high protection and low protection scenarios. Likely land use transitions by 2022 across zones based on transitions during was done through cellular automata and Markov chain process (MC). The analyses highlight the loss of forest cover by by 2022 in the coastal zone with escalating population density. Similar situation of decline in Sahyadri region is noticed with execution of dams, hydroelectric projects and monoculture plantations. Lower transitions as compared with the second scenario highlights regulatory role in protection. However, forests in plain region show loss of in both scenarios due to population pressure and market induced land cover changes. This necessitates policy interventions by the federal government to mitigate forest loss towards sustainable development.\\'Abstract: \\' Oryza malampuzhaensis Krish.et Chand. (2n = 4x = 48; Poaceae,Oryza) is endemic to Western Ghats, South India, and shows a highly localized distribution over a small geographical area in this region. This is the most poorly understood taxon in genusOryza and is often misidentified asO. officinalis owing to their close morphology. We assessed the nature and distribution of genetic variation among 11 populations ofO. malampuzhaensis using random amplified polymorphic DNA markers. The analysis revealed low genetic variation inO. malampuzhaensis. Cluster analysis of pairwise genetic distances of populations revealed three distinct clusters and the grouping of populations largely corresponded to their geographical proximity. Restricted gene flow and a geography-dependent differentiation were evident among populations. The altitude-influenced differences in ecological factors among the natural habitats of the populations seem to be the cause of the geography-dependent differentiation. Genetically isolated smaller populations and a narrow genetic base inO. malampuzhaensis point to its vulnerability to genetic drift and genetic depauperation. ThusO. malampuzhaensis appears to be under the threat of extinction and needs to be conserved by use of suitable methods. The present study also identified molecular markers diagnostic forO. malampuzhaensis.\\'Abstract: \\'Forty-five species of wild edible fruits were identified and traditional local knowledge of their usage was recorded in 40 villages of Kodagu district in Central Western Ghats, India one of the eight top hotspots of biodiversity in the world. We combined biodiversity inventory of trees with village interviews to record traditional ecological knowledge. Wild edible fruits were an opportunistic source of food for rural people. Wild edible fruits were rich in minerals, vitamins, carbohydrates, proteins, fats and fiber. In recent years there has been a decline in numbers of wild fruit trees due to changes in land use from uncultivated private wooded area to cardamom and coffee cultivation. The availability of wild edible fruits that were once very common on private cultivated areas has declined and their distributions are now restricted more to jungles and wildlife sanctuaries. We propose methods for conservation and describe the need for sustainable utilization to provide supplementary sources of nutritional and pharmaceutically useful edible wild fruits.\\'Abstract: \\'Teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) is one of the most durable timbers in the world that is used for all conceivable purposes. Its widespread use has constrained the distribution of species to small and isolated populations. The genetic structure within and between nine natural teak growing forests of the Western Ghats of India belonging to the states of Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu was investigated using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to provide reasoned scientific management practices and conservation measures. The use of ten selective primer combinations on 180 samples (9 populations X 20 trees) resulted in a total of 665 bands of which were polymorphic. Gene diversity index (H) varied from 0.1387 (Barchi) to 0.2449 (Wayanad). The mean gene diversity (HS) was 0.1995 and the total gene diversity (HT) was 0.264. The Southern Western Ghats populations showed higher within population gene diversity. The relative magnitude of genetic differentiation among populations (GST) was 0.244. Positive correlation between genetic and geographical distances was observed. PCoA, UPGMA and STRUCTURE analyses revealed the tendency of the individual trees within a population to align together indicating specific identity of each population. In the UPGMA dendrogram, Nilambur population joined separately with a large cluster in which the other Kerala populations and Tamil Nadu population formed sub clusters indicating a separate identity for Nilambur population among Southern Western Ghats populations.\\'Abstract: \\'Western Ghats are considered as one of the global biodiversity hotspots. There is an information gap on conservation status of the biodiversity hotspots. This study has quantified estimates of deforestation in the Western Ghats over a period of past nine decades. The classified forest cover maps for 1920, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013 indicates 95,446 (73.1%), 63,123 (48.4%), 62,286 (47.7%), 61,551 (47.2%), 61,511 (47.1%) and 61,511 km2 (47.1%) of the forest area, respectively. The rates of deforestation have been analyzed in different time phases, i.e., and The grid cells of 1 km2 have been generated for time series analysis and describing spatial changes in forests. The net rate of deforestation was found to be 0.75 during 0.13 during 0.12 during and 0.01 during Overall forest loss in Western Ghats was estimated as 33,579 km2 (35.3% of the total forest) from to 2013. Land use change analysis indicates highest transformation of forest to plantations, followed by agriculture and degradation to scrub. The dominant forest type is tropical semi-evergreen which comprises 21,678 km2 (35.2%) of the total forest area of Western Ghats, followed by wet evergreen forest (30.6%), moist deciduous forest (24.8%) and dry deciduous forest (8.1%) in 2013. Even though it has the highest population density among the hotspots, there is no quantifiable net rate of deforestation from 2005 to 2013 which indicates increased measures of conservation.\\'hierarchy process (AHP) and RUSLE techniques\\'Abstract: \\'The present work integrates analytical hierarchy process (AHP) with Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model to determine the critical soil erosion prone areas along with the spatial pattern of annual average soil erosion rates of an upland agricultural sub-watershed in the Western Ghats of Kerala, India. The critical soil erosion prone areas were identified by integrating geo-environmental variables such as land use/land cover, geomorphology, drainage density, drainage frequency, lineament frequency, slope, and relative relief after determining its relative contribution in conditioning the terrain susceptible to soil erosion by AHP technique, in a raster-based Geographic Information Systems environment. The spatial pattern of average annual soil erosion rates was obtained by RUSLE model that consider five factors, viz., rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodability (K), slope length and steepness (LS), cover management (C) and conservation practice (P) factors. The soil erosion probability map prepared by the AHP method was reclassified into soil erosion severity map showing regions of different erosion probability. Among this, the critical erosion zone occupies of the total area followed by high erosion severity zone occupies of the study area. Nil and low zones together constitute of the total area. The assessed annual average soil loss from the watershed shows an increased value of as the maximum loss. The cross-comparison of potential soil erosion severity map with annual average soil loss in the area validates the finding of the study by a high spatial correlation. More erosion proneness and annual loss were observed in areas where the side slope plateau, denudational slope, and valley fills comes with high slope and relative relief. The intense terrain modification in this area with improper soil conservation measures makes the watershed more vulnerable to soil erosion.\\'India\\'Abstract: \\' Dysoxylum malabaricum (white cedar) is an economically important tree species, endemic to the Western Ghats, India, which is the most densely populated biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we used variation at ten nuclear simple sequence repeat loci to investigate genetic diversity and fine scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) in seedlings and adults of D. malabaricum from four forest patches in the northern part of the Western Ghats. When genetic variation was compared between seedlings and adults across locations, significant differences were detected in allelic richness, observed heterozygosity, fixation index (F IS), and relatedness Reduced genetic diversity and increased relatedness at the seedling stage might be due to fragmentation and disturbance. There was no FSGS at the adult stage and FSGS was limited to shorter distance classes at the seedling stage. However, there was clear spatial genetic structure at the landscape level regardless of age class, due to limited gene flow between forest patches. A comparison of the distributions of size classes in the four locations with published data from a more southern area, showed that large trees (diameter at breast height, DBH, are present in the southern sacred forests but not in the northern forest reserves. This pattern is likely due to stronger harvesting pressure in the north compared to the south, because in the north there are no cultural taboos regulating the extraction of natural resources. The implications for forest conservation in this biodiversity hotspot are discussed.\\'Abstract: \\'This article analyzes landscape pattern in the WesternGhats mountain ranges in south-western India at two scales,comparing small-scale, detailed studies of landscapepattern, with broader, regional-scale assessments of theWestern Ghats. Due in large part to their inaccessibility,relatively little is known about the landscapes of thisbiodiverse region, which also supports some of the highestpopulation densities in the world. A broad-scale NDVI-basedIRS 1B satellite image classification is used to analyzenorth-south and east-west trends across the entire WesternGhats and western coast of India, an area over 170 000 km2. Northern and eastern landscapes are morefragmented compared to the southern and western slopes.Western slopes also have greater landscape diversity withland cover types more interspersed compared to the easternslopes. These differences can be related to north-south andeast-west variations in rainfall and plant distribution. Data from thirteen landscapes km2 in area, arefurther utilized to analyze trends in landscape pattern, anddescribe the geographical distribution of major natural andmanaged ecotope types. At this scale, very high levels ofintra-ecotope type variability in landscape pattern areencountered for all land cover types. Results at these twoscales are integrated to suggest a hierarchical stratifiedapproach for monitoring land cover and biodiversity in the region.\\'Abstract: \\' Fimbristylis tuckeri, a perennial fimbristyloid sedge from Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve and its environs in Western Ghats, India is described as a new species.

This species is distributed in the Western Ghats of southern India and is well known for its wood (Rao It has gained considerable interest in recent years because of the pharmacologically important compound rohitukine and its derivative flavopiridol. Rohitukine, a chromane alkaloid, is reported to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-fertility, anti-implantation, anti-cancer and immuno-modulatory properties (Naik Carlson Sedlacek Mohanakumara Dysobinin, the other chemical compound isolated from fruits of this tree is also reported to exhibit significant central nervous system depressant action and mild anti-inflammatory activity (Singh The bark is also reported to be used for the treatment of leprosy and foul ulcers (Jain and DeFilipps 1991).\\'Abstract: \\'A new species, Glyphochloa maharashtraensis, and a new variety, Glyphochloa maharasthraensis var. hirsuta are described and illustrated from the Western Ghats of India.\\'Abstract: \\'The effect of fragmentation on different life forms within tropical forest plant communities is poorly understood. We studied the effect of degree of fragmentation and surrounding matrix on trees, lianas, shrubs and epiphytes in tropical forest fragments of Kodagu, Western Ghats, India. These fragments exist as sacred groves amidst a highly modified agricultural landscape, and have been preserved by the religious sentiments of local communities. Plants were sampled at two sites in continuous forests and 11 forest fragments. A total of 122 species of trees, 29 species of lianas, 60 species of shrubs and 66 species of epiphytes were recorded. Trees exhibited a significant relationship (R Richness estimates after controlling for stem density (rarefaction) revealed that observed relationship was not an artefact of passive sampling. Variation in species richness of the other three groups was explained by stem density and structural diversity. Linear distance from the reserve forest did not explain any variation in species richness. All life forms exhibited significant nested pattern. Trees were nested along the area gradient while nestedness in the other three groups showed evidence in support of habitat nestedness. The four life forms thus responded variably to degree of fragmentation. Our study revealed that 74% of the regional diversity for trees was contributed by diversity among plots, highlighting the importance of inter-patch habitat diversity in maintaining the total regional species pool. We conclude that trees alone cannot serve as good indicator for taking appropriate conservation measures to mitigate species loss resulting from habitat fragmentation.\\'Abstract: \\'Assessment of vulnerability is an important step in building long-term resilience in the forestry sector. The objective of this paper is to present a methodological approach to assess inherent vulnerability of forests at landscape level. The approach involves use of vulnerability indicators, the pairwise comparison method, and geographic information system (GIS) tools. We apply this approach to assess the inherent vulnerability of forests of the Western Ghats Karnataka (WGK) landscape, which is a part of the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in India. Four vulnerability indicators, namely biological richness, disturbance index, canopy cover, and slope, are selected. We find that forests in 30, 36, 19, and grid points in this region show low, medium, high, and very high inherent vulnerability, respectively. The forest showing high and very high inherent vulnerability are mostly dry deciduous forests and plantations located largely on the eastern side of the landscape. We also find that canopy cover is one of the key indicators that determine the inherent vulnerability of forests, and natural forests are inherently less vulnerable than man-made plantations. Spatial assessment of inherent vulnerability of forests at landscape level is particularly useful for developing strategies to build resilience to current stressors and climate change in future.\\'Abstract: \\'Within a 30-ha permanent plot of a tropical evergreen forest in the Anamalais, Indian Western Ghats, all the trees (belonging to 153 species) were identified and tagged during This communication reports the results of tree population changes based on two annual censuses (1999 and 2000) of the plot after the initial census, and compares the results with other tropical forest sites. One species, Ficus beddomei, disappeared from the plot and there was no new addition of species. Of the 96 species that showed changes in their population density, for 12 species recruitment and mortality matched. Tree recruitment (5 exceeded mortality (4 during the two-year period. Four modes of tree deaths were recorded in our site. The per cent mortality of trees differed between tree size classes during each recensus. The plot tree density increased progressively in the two-year period, indicating that shifts in species composition and density in natural forests, without major catastrophic disturbance, occur slowly.\\'Abstract: \\'The morphometric analysis of river basins represents a simple procedure to describe hydrologic and geomorphic processes operating on a basin scale. A morphometric analysis was carried out to evaluate the drainage characteristics of two adjoining, mountain river basins of the southern Western Ghats, India, Muthirapuzha River Basin (MRB) in the western slopes and Pambar River Basin (PRB) in the eastern slopes. The basins, forming a part of the Proterozoic, high-grade, Southern Granulite Terrain of the Peninsular India, are carved out of a terrain dominantly made of granite- and hornblende-biotite gneisses. The Western Ghats, forming the basin divide, significantly influences the regional climate (i.e., humid climate in MRB, while semi-arid in PRB). The Survey of India topographic maps (1:50,000) and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission digital elevation data were used as the base for delineation and analysis. Both river basins are of 6th order and comparable in basin geometry. The drainage patterns and linear alignment of the drainage networks suggest the influence of structural elements. The Rb of either basins failed to highlight the structural controls on drainage organization, which might be a result of the elongated basin shape. The irregular trends in Rb between various stream orders suggest the influence of geology and relief on drainage branching. The Dd values designate the basins as moderate- to well-drained with lower infiltration rates. The overall increasing trend of Rl between successive stream orders suggests a geomorphic maturity of either basins and confirmed by the characteristic I hyp values. The Re values imply an elongate shape for both MRB and PRB and subsequently lower vulnerability to flash floods and hence, easier flood management. The relatively higher Rr of PRB is an indicative of comparatively steeply sloping terrain and consequently higher intensity of erosion processes. Further, the derivatives of digital elevation data (slope, aspect, topographic wetness index, and stream power index), showing significant differences between MRB and PRB, are useful in soil conservation plans. The study highlighted the variation in morphometric parameters with respect to the dissimilarities in topography and climate.\\'endangered ethnomedicinal plant from Western Ghats, India\\'Abstract: \\' Decalepis arayalpathra, an endangered, endemic ethnomedicinal plant from southern Western Ghats, India, is targeted for its aromatic and medicinal properties. This study aimed at to identify fungal endophyte populations associated with healthy and diseased roots of this perennial shrub. Healthy and rotted root samples of D. arayalpathra were collected, fungal endophytes assemblages were identified both by culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches, further sequenced and the retrieved sequences were analysed with the reference sequences in GenBank to know their phylogenetic relationships. Analysis of the ITS rDNA region generated 24 different Ascomycota and three Basidiomycota taxa. Trichoderma sp. was most abundant in healthy and diseased root samples, while Penicillium and Aspergillus were confined to healthy roots. Furthermore, Fusarium solani, Fusarium oxysporum and Mucor velutinosus were found to be the most frequent fungi identified from the rotted root samples, thus substantiated to be the cause for D. arayalpathra decline in the wild. Interestingly, the strains assigned to Fusarium sp. were isolated from diseased roots showing typical clearly visible symptoms, such as a severe brown discolouration on the taproot. Molecular profiling of all the pure fungal isolates, viz., Trichoderma, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium and Mucor, revealed high sequence similarities to corresponding reference sequences. Sequencing of Trichoderma pure cultures isolated from healthy and diseased roots revealed sequence similarities to Trichoderma harzianum, T. hamatum, T. koningiopsis, T. asperellum, T. pubescens and Hypocrea sp. This confirms the morphological examinations, as Hypocrea is the teleomorph stage of Trichoderma sp. This study signifies the first work pertaining to the taxonomy of the fungal endophytic community of D. arayalpathra, and the results reported in this work may help to ascertain the cause of root rot disease often perceived in D. arayalpathra. Also, it could be useful to identify the promising endophytic communities against the root rot diseases occurring in D. arayalpathra.\\'Abstract: \\' Vateria indica is a critically-endangered and economically-important tree endemic to the Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot in India. Due to extreme local endemism and anthropogenic destructive harvesting of resin, the species is categorized as critically endangered. The present study investigated the biotic limiting factors of recruitment of V. inidica in its natural populations, and studied the pattern of anthropogenic harvest of nuts of V. indica in the recent past. Seed predation and seedling herbivory particularly by insects were assessed. The sustainability of the nut harvest was assessed by conducting pre- and post-harvest censuses of nuts on forest floors. Over of the fruits of V. indica were infested by the insects, but, only about of the infested fruits were seed-predated. Seedling herbivores included a leaf miner, ants of two species, and larvae of a lymantrid moth. Seedling mortality due to herbivores was moderate Pre- and post-harvest censuses showed that only of the fruits that were naturally-fallen on the forest floor were spared after the harvest had taken place. Sringeri has exported 820 metric tons of nuts in the study year, which was an all-time high estimate. The study concludes that the anthropogenic nut collection can hamper the population structure of V. indica locally. Since V. indica has an alternate-year major flowering cycle, the seed loss as seen in the present study is critical. Raising plantations of V. indica as an afforestation program can contribute to the conservation of the species and the development of local communities.\\'Abstract: \\'The objective of the present work is to study the chemical variation in Calophyllum inophyllum growing along the Western Ghats of India.

The contents of dipyranocoumarins were estimated in seeds collected from 20 locations. Leaves from plants at the same 20 locations were assayed for ISSR variation. A dendrogram based on genetic distance as well as principal component analysis based on dipyranocoumarins and ISSR variation clustered plants from these 20 locations into three groups that indicated close relationship among ISSR, dipyranocoumarins contents, and geographical position (variation) of locations. Based on this study, two locations of elite plants were identified.\\'Abstract: \\'Eleven populations of the tetraploid Oryza officinalis Wall ex Watt were collected from five forest ranges along the Western Ghats in Kerala, South India. Multivariate discriminant analysis using 15 morphological characters revealed a high degree of variation within the taxon. Such infra-specific taxonomic diversity points to the perpetuation of the polyploid segregants at different localities as a result of selection under varying micro ecosystems.\\'Abstract: attempts to intensify the use of natural resources can often result in the exhaustion of the resource or deterioration of other interacting resources. The single-minded pursuit of the development of the water resources of the rivers of the Western Ghats shows many examples of this view, particularly in the unnecessary destruction of the dwindling forest resources. This destruction may be caused by (i) problems o f rehabilitation, e.g. the Ramanagar settlement of the Kalinadi project (ii) the impact of labourers, e.g. the destruction of evergreen sholas on the Upper Nilgiri plateau (iii) the access to encroachers and poachers, e.g. Panshet and Kalinadi (iv) faulty planning, e.g. Linganamakki and Kalinadi. This destruction of forest cover has had a number of deleterious consequences in (i) worsening the shortages of forest resources, (ii) hastening the siltation of the reservoirs, (iii) ecological imbalances as in the rapid spread ofEupatorium in the Kalinadi project area and (iv) the decimation of biological diversity, as in the great reduction of evergreen forests in the Western Ghats, threatening the survival of lion-tailed macaque and the extinction of grass species,Hubbardia heptaneuron. It is stressed that the only sustainable and therefore true development is environmentally sound development. The interests of the weaker sections of the society often provide a good index of the soundness of the development from an environmental point of view. The planning of the development process with this perspective is a great scientific and technological challenge that must be taken up.\\'Abstract: \\'Herbaceous vascular epiphytes were screened in a total sample of 13 445 trees (in 153 species) and 348 lianas (in 30 species) cm girth at breast height in a 30 ha plot of tropical evergreen forest at Varagalaiar, Indian Western Ghats. Of these, 4.3% of trees and 3.7% of lianas were infested with epiphytes. Epiphyte diversity totaled 26 species in 19 genera and 10 families. Sixteen species were angiosperms in three families (Orchidaceae 54%; Piperaceae and Araceae 8%) and 10 species (38%) were pteridophytes in seven families. The orchid, Pholidota pallida was most abundant and occurred on 178 (29.6%) stems. Asplenium nidus occurred on the maximum of 62 host species. The species richness estimators employed for species accumulation curves after 100 times randomization of sample order have stabilized the curve at 18th and 19th hectares respectively for Incidence-based Coverage Estimator and Chao2. A total of 588 trees and 13 liana stems lodged epiphytes, 74% of which were evergreen species and 26% deciduous. Epiphyte density was greater (56%) in deciduous species (Bischofia javanica 30% and Vitex altissima 8%). A significant positive relationship was found between trunk size and epiphyte association. Larger epiphyte species occurred mostly on middle and larger stems and smaller epiphyte species occurred on smaller stems. The majority of epiphytes (92%) were of autochorous dispersal type, bearing capsule or dust diaspores, while the remaining species with berries and nutlets are dispersed by small vertebrates.\\'Abstract: \\'The center of diversity of Piper nigrum L. (Black Pepper), one of the highly valued spice crops is reported to be from India. Black pepper is naturally distributed in India in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot and is the only known existing source of its wild germplasm in the world. We used ecological niche models to predict the potential distribution of wild P. nigrum in the present and two future climate change scenarios viz (A1B) and (A2A) for the year 2080. Three topographic and nine uncorrelated bioclim variables were used to develop the niche models. The environmental variables influencing the distribution of wild P. nigrum across different climate change scenarios were identified. We also assessed the direction and magnitude of the niche centroid shift and the change in niche breadth to estimate the impact of projected climate change on the distribution of P. nigrum. The study shows a niche centroid shift in the future climate scenarios. Both the projected future climate scenarios predicted a reduction in the habitat of P. nigrum in Southern Western Ghats, which harbors many wild accessions of P. nigrum. Our results highlight the impact of future climate change on P. nigrum and provide useful information for designing sound germplasm conservation strategies for P. nigrum.\\'Abstract: \\'Plants diversity and phenological pattern of the trees were monitored in a montane wet temperate forest (shola) in the Kukkal Forest, Palni hills of the southern Western Ghats, India. Twelve random plots were selected for sampling the vegetation. For phenological studies, twenty-three fleshy fruit trees were identified in the study area and 10 individuals of each species were selected to record the phenological events fortnightly between April 2002 and April 2004. The phenological events were divided into vegetative and reproductive phases. A total of 2279 individuals were inventoried which belong to 83 species, 68 genera and 40 families. About 30% of the species were endemic to the Western Ghats. The most dominant species 1 cm dbh) was Psychotria nilgiriensis var. astephana (Rubiaceae), which accounted for 12% of the total sampled individuals. Lauraceae was the dominant family accounting for 20% of the individuals. Fruiting peak occurred in July 2003 and least in June 2002. During the peak period, fruits of 85 individuals of six species were observed. Syzygium tamilnadensis, Ilex wightiana and Beilschmiedia wightii fruited only once during the two years of study. The number of fruiting species showed no correlation with rainfall (r = 0.26, p = 0.2), while a correlation was found with fruit abundance (r = 0.40, p < 0.05). The results indicate that the montane wet temperate forest is unique in their diversity and a conspicuous display in phenology.\\'Abstract: \"Young shoots collected from mature trees of Calophyllum apetalum during the flush season were red weeks), pinkish-red weeks), pale green weeks) and dark green weeks) coloured after different periods of growth.

The shoot tip was a relatively poor source of regeneration (2.3 shoots per explant; 39% of explants). Subculturing of explants from in vitro derived shoots for 5 weeks in medium containing 4.4 BAP resulted in the formation of an increased number and percentage of shoots in the nodes (5.3 per explant; 74% of explants). The shoot cultures were transferred to 1/2 MS basal medium for 4 weeks to induce the elongation of shoots cm). Rooting of the microshoots (>2.0 cm) was achieved when cultured in quarter strength MS medium supplemented with 9.8 IBA for 4 weeks followed by transfer to 1/4 MS basal medium for 4 weeks.

Here, molecular methods were used for assessment of 246 barcodes belonging to 81 fish species from northern Western Ghats of India, using, Barcode gap analysis, barcode index number, automatic barcode gap discovery, Poisson tree processes and general mixed Yule-coalescent, these methods had their potential to discriminate 97.53%, 93.90% 95.06%, 93.82% and 92.59% of species respectively. But, some of them tended to estimate the inconsistent number of species leading to discrepancies between the morphological concept and inference from molecular phylogenetic reconstructions. So, we took a standard approach to recognize those methods that produced consistent results, three of five such methods were identified that revealed three hidden cryptic species complexes in Monopterus indicus, Parambassis ranga and Systomus sarana. Further, to validate these three genetically diverged species, we used diagnostic character based approach along with nine unidentified species through BLOG and WEKAs SMO classifier. Those methods were unable to identify these species, which might be due to the limited number of specimens used for the analysis. This is the first effort to generate the DNA barcode reference library of freshwater fishes from northern Western Ghats of India, one of the biodiversity hotspots. These barcodes when analyzed through the defined workflow, will provide valuable measures to prove the efficiency of molecular species delimitation methods in taxonomic discrimination which aid conservation of biodiversity.\\'Abstract: \\'Soil and water conservation along with crop productivity improvement is indispensable for sustainable development of rainfed areas. Integration of suitable fruit trees within the cropping system can reduce risk allied with rainfed farming. The system of raising multi-height plant species with agricultural crops known as multitier agroforestry system was assessed for resource conservation and production potential in rainfed conditions of Eastern Ghats region in India. Thirty experimental plots, each of dimension with slope having different multitier agroforestry treatments were assessed for soil erosion, nutrient loss and crop yield. Results revealed that multitier plantation of drumstick (Moringa oleifera) with Gliricidia sepium hedgerow and ginger (Zingiber officinale): pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) (8:2) intercropping enumerated minimum mean runoff and soil loss This treatment saved more soil organic carbon, more phosphorus and more potassium, respectively than broadcasted finger millet cultivation (traditional practice). An increase of drumstick fruit yield was observed in Gliricidia hedgerow based multitier agroforestry systems over non-Gliricidia systems. The findings will contribute as a technical reference for the promotion of hedgerow based multitier agroforestry for resource conservation and fertility restoration of sloping lands.\\'India\\'Abstract: \\'Habitat fragmentation is considered the most serious threat to primate conservation in the tropics, and understanding it effects on lion-tailed macaque is very important because most of the populations live in fragmented habitats. We examined demographic parameters of 9 lion-tailed macaque groups in 8 rain forest fragments with reference to fragment area, tree density, canopy cover, tree height, and total basal area of food trees. Group size ranged from 7 to 90 individuals but was not related to habitat variables. Birth and growth rates of groups did not differ significantly between small and large fragments. Tree density, canopy cover, and total basal of food trees all show strong positive correlations with fragment area. Growth rate correlates with tree density, but there are no other significant relationships between birth or growth rate and habitat variables. The percentage of immature individuals in the group is significantly positively associated with the total basal area of food trees, but not with any other habitat variable. Comparison of our data from this study with data available for the same population in 1996 indicates a slight decline in birth rate but an increase in total number of individuals, from 154 to 242. Of the 5 small fragment groups, 3 have increased in size since 1996 while the sizes of the other 2 groups have remained the same. Based on this study, we advocate that to manage the fragile lion-tailed macaque groups the following steps need to be taken: 1) create dispersal corridors between the fragments using fruit trees to facilitate male dispersal, 2) construct canopy bridges across the prevailing roads, 3) protect the fragments from further degradation, and 4) periodically monitor these populations for long-term conservation.\\'Abstract: \\'Frogs in the genus Indirana are endemic to Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. The species are poorly studied and in many cases threatened or endangered. Here we describe primers and polymerase chain reactions for 62 microsatellite loci for Indirana beddomii, one of the commonest frogs in the genus. Fifty-six of the primers were polymorphic on sample of 23 individuals from a single sampling site (Ponmudi, Kerala) with an average 9.11 alleles per locus The average observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.64 and 0.71, respectively. The loci should be useful in conservation genetic studies of Indirana frogs.\\'Abstract: \\'Biodiversity and ecosystem services play key roles in future economic strategies seeking to promote development and prosperity. This study assesses the status of biodiversity and flow of ecosystem services from selected forest types in the Western Ghats. At the sampling sites, the number of tree species ranged from 16 to 79 per hectare depending on the forest type. The estimates for index for trees in the evergreen, moist deciduous and dry deciduous forest plots were 3.02, 2.9 and 1.54, respectively. The total biomass carbon stocks in evergreen, moist deciduous and dry deciduous forests in the study area was 229, 221 and respectively. Analysis of dependency patterns of local communities on forest resources indicated a high dependency on provisional services such as fuelwood, manure and fodder. The study records the highest dependency rates for fuelwood, ranging between 72 and 100% for the three forest types and indicates that forest ecosystems underpin the well-being of the population dependent directly and indirectly on them.\\'Abstract: \\'Biologically mediated soil processes rely on soil biota to provide vital ecosystem services in natural and managed ecosystems. However, land use changes continue to impact on assemblages of soil biota and the ecosystem services they provide. The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of land use intensification on the distribution and abundance of soil invertebrate communities in the Nilgiri, a human-dominated biosphere reserve of international importance. Soil invertebrates were sampled in 15 land use practices ranging from simple and intensively managed annual crop fields and monoculture tree plantations through less intensively managed agroforestry and pristine forest ecosystems. The lowest taxonomic richness was found in annual crops and coconut monoculture plantations, while the highest was in moist-deciduous and semi-evergreen forests. With 21 ant species, agroforestry systems had the highest diversity of ants followed by forest ecosystems (12 species). Earthworms and millipedes were significantly more abundant in agroforestry systems, plantations and forest ecosystems than in annual crop fields. Ants, termites, beetles, centipedes, crickets and spiders were more abundant in forest ecosystems than in other ecosystems. It is concluded that annual cropping systems have lower diversity and abundance of soil invertebrates than agroforestry and natural forest ecosystems. These results and the literature from other regions highlight the potential role that agroforestry practices can play in biodiversity conservation in an era of ever-increasing land use intensification and habitat loss.\\'Abstract: \\'Contrary to expectations, some human-modified landscapes are considered to sustain both human activities and biodiversity over the long-term. Agroforestry systems are among these landscapes where crops are planted under native shade trees. In this context, ancient agroforestry systems can provide insight into how farmers managed the landscape over time. Such insight can help to quantify the extent to which tropical forests (especially habitat-specialist trees) are responding to local and landscape-level management. Here, we extracted fossil pollen (indicator of past vegetation changes) and macroscopic charcoal (indicator of biomass burning) from four forest sedimentary sequences in an ancient agroforestry system in Western Ghats, India. We used a mixed-modelling approach and a principal components analysis (PCA) to determine past trajectories of forest change and species composition dynamics for the last In addition, we reconstructed the long-term forest canopy dynamics and examined the persistence of habitat-specialist trees over time. Our results show that the four sites diverged to a surprising degree in both taxa composition and dynamics. However, despite these differences, forest has persisted over under agricultural activities within agroforestry systems. This long-term analysis highlights the importance of different land-use legacies as a framework to increase the effectiveness of management across tropical agricultural lands.\\'Abstract: \\'An efficient protocol was developed for the rapid in vitro multiplication of an endemic and critically endangered medicinal herb, Ceropegia noorjahaniae Ans., via enhanced axillary bud proliferation from nodal explants.

The highest number of shoots maximum shoot length and the highest response of shoot induction were recorded on MS medium supplemented with BAP. Rooting was best achieved on half-strength MS medium augmented with IBA Half-strength MS medium supplemented with BAP and sucrose w/v) produced an average of 5.6 flower buds per microshoots with highest flower bud induction response. The plantlets regenerated in vitro with well-developed shoot and roots were successfully established in pots containing sterile sand and coco peat (1:1) and grown in a greenhouse with survival rate. The regenerated plants did not show any detectable morphological variation. The developed method can be successfully employed for large-scale multiplication and conservation of C. noorjahaniae.\\'Abstract: \\'Species diversity of earthworms in tropics is less studied compared to those of the temperate regions. Despite the fact that there have been numerous studies on earthworm diversity in the Western Ghats of India, there still exists scope for more earthworm species which are yet to be described. The present work involves a survey of earthworms in the Nilgiri biosphere reserve part of a biodiversity hot spot of Western Ghats. Despite being a part of the biodiversity hot spot, studies on earthworm diversity at NBR are very limited. Unless an authentic record of earthworm species is made available, the consequence of human interference, habitat alteration or climate change on the species diversity cannot be assessed. An attempt has been made in this study to conduct a survey of earthworm species available in the selected forest ecosystems of the NBR. The findings of this study have shown that of the earthworm species identified is native, while the rest are exotic. On the basis of total number of earthworms collected, exotics accounted for indicating the predominance of native species in the study area and indicating that this habitat is less disturbed. Among the species identified from Mukurthi, Priodochaeta pellucida is listed as vulnerable and has never been encountered since its discovery about ago. indices showed that evergreen forests of Silent Valley have a high species diversity as do shola/grasslands of Mukurthi and moist deciduous forests of Muthanga.\\'Abstract: \\'Western Ghats, one of the megadiversity hotspots, hold a rich treasure of diversity in Momordica L. comprising M. charantia var. muricata, M. charantia var. charantia, M. dioica and M. sahyadrica.

Traditional uses of these species comprising food, medicinal and cosmetic, culinary preparations, vernacular names in local dialects and taboos and religious beliefs relating to their domestication and folk taxonomy are dealt with in this paper.\\'Abstract: \\' Musa acuminata ssp. burmannica, one of the wild progenitors contributing to the present-day dessert bananas, has a long evolutionary history intervened by human activities. In this study, ISSR markers were used to analyze the pattern of genetic variation and differentiation in 32 individuals along with two reference samples (viz., Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides, var. Calcutta 4 and Musa balbisiana) of wild Musa, which corresponded to three populations across the biodiversity-rich hot spot of southern Western Ghats of India. High levels of genetic diversity were revealed both at the species and population levels, using diversity indices. The hierarchical analysis of molecular variance showed pronounced genetic differentiation, as of the total variance was fixed within population and only among populations. genetic differentiation coefficient (G and low gene flow further confirmed this. The positive correlation (Mantel test) between geographic distance and genetic distance indicates geographic isolation as one of the key factors in shaping the population genetic structure. Grouping of individuals was largely in conformity with their spatial distribution, which was confirmed by UPGMA cluster analysis and PCA scatter plot clustering all 32 individuals into three major groups along a geographical gradient. The discontinuous distribution and dwindling population due to habitat fragmentation are serious threats to prevailing genetic diversity in this species. Conservation measures based on diversity pattern are suggested for long-term preservation and sustainable utilization of this precious genetic resource.\\'Abstract: \\' Cucumis silentvalleyi (Manilal, T. Sabu et P.J. Mathew) Ghebretinsae et Thulin and Cucumis indicus Ghebretinsae et Thulin are two rare narrow endemics of Western Ghats of India. Both have morphological resemblance but distinguishable by a few key characters like shape of the leaf, ovary and fruit, and chromosome number. While both are edible and non-bitter, their distribution is mutually exclusive, but overlapping with Cucumis sativus var. hardwickii (Royle) Alef. (the wild and feral form of C. sativus L.). Interspecific crossability studies indicate that both are related to each other and to a lesser extent to Cucumis setosus Cogn. and Cucumis melo L. Being incompletely described, a comparative account of their morphology, phenology, distribution, ecology and conservation are provided.\\'Abstract: \\'Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae, Caesalpinioideae) is a dominant self-incompatible ant-plant or myrmecophyte, growing as an understorey tree in high-density patches. It is endemic to the biodiversity hotspot of the southern Western Ghats of India and, besides ants, harbours many endemic invertebrate taxa, such as bees that pollinate it as well as arboreal earthworms, within swollen hollow stem internodes called domatia. Using inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers, three geographically separated populations were found to be multiclonal, characterized by high levels of clonal diversity. Values for the Simpson diversity index ranged between 0.764 and 0.964, and for evenness index between 0.00 and 0.036 for neighbourhoods within populations. This myrmecophyte was found to combine sexual recruitment (66.7%) and clonal production (33.3%) as methods of reproduction. Moderate amounts of genetic diversity at the species level were observed, with 52.63% polymorphism, and moderate values of diversity index (0.1895) as well as of gene diversity (0.1186). In each population, observed genotypic diversity was significantly lower than expected, indicating significant genetic structure. Neighbour-joining trees demonstrated that Agumbe, which is the most northern population examined and geographically twice as far away from the other two populations, grouped separately and with larger bootstrap support from a larger cluster consisting of the Sampaji and Solaikolli populations, which are closer to each other geographically. Some neighbourhoods within each population showed spatial genetic structure even at small spatial scales of <5 m. A combination of clonality and short-distance pollen movement by small pollinating bees (Braunsapis puangensis) coupled with primary ballistic seed dispersal, and possible secondary seed dispersal by rodents, may contribute to spatial genetic structure at such small scales. The clonality of H. brunonis may be a factor that contributes to its dominance in Western Ghat forests where it supports a rich diversity of invertebrate fauna.\\'plant of Western Ghats, India\\'Abstract: \\' Decalepis arayalpathra popularly used as an effective remedy for peptic ulcer, gastric antisecretory and cancer-like afflictions with an immunomodulatory property. This study was conducted to unravel the chemical composition of the tuberous root and bioactivities of the compounds in the fractions of antioxidant activity by using large-scale multi-targeted approach, which is still unexplored. Methanolic extract (EM) and its sequential fraction (EC: chloroform extract, EEA: ethyl acetate extract, EB: butanol extract, EA: aqueous extract) were used for qualitative and quantitative of phytocompounds present in the tuberous root of the plant. The characterization of 2H4MB and chlorogenic acid by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was also performed with the help of standard compound. The results revealed the extract to be rich in phenolics, tannins, flavonoids, carbohydrate, saponin and alkaloids. EM proved to be a compatible solvent for the extraction and corresponds to maximum numbers of phytocompounds followed by its fraction (EB, EA, EEA and EC). EM, EB and EEA were further subjected for gas spectrometry analysis, which revealed the presence of more than 20 different bioactive compounds. The methanolic extract and its successive fractions were also screened for the antioxidant activity using different prototype. 2H4MB and chlorogenic acid quantified by HPLC in methanol extract was 11.22 and respectively. The reported compound might be responsible for the potent antioxidant property of the plant. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the analysis of the chemical composition and the bioactive potential of the compounds obtained by extract of D. arayalpathra. \\'Abstract: \\'Life history traits evolve such that the reproductive output of an organism is maximized. Demographic characteristics, a consequence of life history traits, indicate the reproductive output per individual in group-living species. Both phylogenetic and ecological factors influence demographic traits. In the forests of the Western Ghats, India, we studied the demography of three langur species: Semnopithecus johnii, a wet forest-dwelling species; Semnopithecus hypoleucos, largely a wet forest-dwelling species; and Semnopithecus priam, a primarily dry forest-dwelling species. S. hypoleucos and S. priam are genetically closer to each other than to S. johnii. We sampled a total of 193 groups of the three species of langurs. The group size was smaller in the two wet forest-dwelling species, S. johnii and S. hypoleucos (nine), than in the dry forest-dwelling species, S. priam (18). The number of adult females per group was higher in S. priam (seven) and S. johnii (six) than in S. hypoleucos (four). On the other hand, the adult female:immature ratio, indicating reproductive output and life history, was highest in S. johnii (1:0.33) followed by S. hypoleucos (1:1) and S. priam (1:1.09). Our results suggest that reproductive output is lowest in the arboreal wet forest species and increases as the species become somewhat dry deciduous forest dwellers, or almost facultative dry forest dwellers, and relatively more terrestrial. Some traits, such as group size, appear to be more sensitive to ecological factors, and some other traits such as age-sex ratios and reproductive output appear to be more conservative.\\'Abstract: \\' In northern Western Ghats (India), four tropical habitats with different disturbance levels were monitored for diversity and seasonal patterns in butterfly communities. Species richness was highest in late monsoon and early winter. Majority of the butterfly species also showed abundance peaks in these seasons. Fire played a significant role in determining species composition in fire-afflicted areas and affected flight periods of some species but did not affect species richness. Grazing had a major impact on species composition and it favoured only those Lycaenids and Nymphalids whose caterpillars feed on herbs. In case of one of the sites where phenophases of the larval foodplant and population trend of a small Lycaenid was documented, the population showed rapid increase at the time when the plants were in suitable phenophase for growth of the caterpillars. A possible evolutionary interaction between herb-feeding and non-herb-feeding Lycaenids is proposed.\\'Abstract: \\'The community ecology of freshwater fishes in four river systems (Sharavati, Aghanashini, Bedti and Kali) of the central Western Ghats (India) has been studied for the first time. Patterns of fish species distributions were analysed and important stream and environmental parameters determining the species richness and composition of this region were identified. Upstream--downstream trends in species richness and diversity as well as changes in stream characteristics were studied using univariate correlation analyses. Preliminary analyses on changes in species composition and feeding guilds showed the presence of a gradual species turnover along the stream gradient. There were associated changes in the major feeding guild compositions, with a higher proportion of insectivore and algivore/herbivore composition in the upper reaches shifting to a predominance of omnivores and carnivores downstream. product--moment correlation analyses along with stepwise multiple regression analyses identified stream depth and altitude as the important parameters determining species richness. Canonical correspondence analysis was performed to study species associations with environmental parameters. The analysis showed a strong species environmental correlation to the CCA axes, a high significance for the CCA axis 1 as well as for the overall test. The plots of the species and site scores on the CCA axes showed a clear segregation of species based on their relations with environmental and stream properties. This study is an important step in our understanding of the community structure of fish species of these rivers and would be helpful in future efforts on the conservation of aquatic communities and their habitats.\\'Abstract: \\'A new species of Chlorophytum is described and illustrated.

Out of 10 morphospecies of pill millipedes (Arthrosphaera) recovered, four were identified, and the rest did not match with morphological and taxonomic descriptions. A maximum of five species of Arthrosphaera were recovered from the Western Ghat forests. In forests, the biomass of pill millipedes was higher than earthworms but lower in abundance. In plantations, both biomass and abundance of millipedes were higher than those of earthworms. None of the 12 soil edaphic features (moisture, bulk density, water-holding capacity, temperature, pH, conductivity, organic carbon, P, K, Ca, Mg and litter depth) significantly correlated with millipede biomass in the Western Ghat forests, nor were any soil features correlated with earthworm biomass in the west coast plantations. While all, except for soil moisture, were significantly correlated with earthworm biomass in the Western Ghat forests. In the Western Ghat plantations, the biomass of millipedes was significantly correlated with soil moisture, pH, organic carbon and minerals (P, K and Ca). In the west coast plantations, the biomass of millipedes was significantly correlated with moisture, water-holding capacity, organic carbon, Ca, and Mg, while, in the foothill plantations, only with temperature.\\'Abstract: \\'Tropical dry forests and savannas constitute more than half of all tropical forests and grasslands, but little is known about forest fire regimes within these two extensive types of ecosystems. Forest fire regimes in a predominantly dry forest in India, the Nilgiri landscape, and a predominantly savanna ecosystem in the Sathyamangalam landscape, were examined. Remote sensing data were applied to delineate burned areas, determine fire size characteristics, and to estimate fire-rotation intervals. Belt transects (0.5 ha) were used to estimate forest structure, diversity, and fuel loads. Mean area burned, mean number of fires, and mean fire size per year were substantially higher in the Nilgiri landscape compared to the Sathyamangalam landscape. Mean fire-rotational interval was 7.1 yr in the Nilgiri landscape and 44.1 yr in the Sathyamangalam landscape. Tree cm diameter at breast height) species diversity, tree density, and basal area were significantly higher in the Nilgiri landscape compared to the Sathyamangalam landscape. Total fuel loads were significantly higher in tropical dry and moist deciduous forests in the Nilgiri landscape, but total fuel loads were higher in the tropical dry thorn forests of the Sathyamangalam landscape. Thus, the two landscapes revealed contrasting fire regimes and forest characteristics, with more and four-fold larger fires in the Nilgiri landscape. The dry forests and savannas could be maintained by a combination of factors, such as fire, grazing pressures, and herbivore populations. Understanding the factors maintaining these two ecosystems will be critical for their conservation.\\'Abstract: \\'The availability of refuges from predators and high quality food are thought to determine habitat use in small ungulates. We tested this hypothesis on habitat use by the Indian chevrotain in a tropical rainforest in the Western Ghats, using pellet-groups to infer habitat use. Between December 2009 and April 2010, we sampled 204 grids of with four spatial replicates in each, using occupancy framework. We quantified refuges such as fallen logs and boulders, understorey complexity, and noted the presence of fruiting trees in the grid. Detection probability, p, of pellet-groups was estimated at 0.61. The naive estimate of occupancy was 0.52, which increased to 0.73 when p was accounted for. Out of eight candidate models compared using AICC, the one with the number of refuges and understorey complexity was the best model. Both covariates had non-zero positive slopes. Fruiting trees occurred very infrequently and did not influence habitat use, perhaps because the chevrotain fed more on buds, shoots and young leaves during the dry period covered by this study. The strong influence of understorey complexity on habitat use was perhaps also due to the abundance of these food items. These results highlight the need to control human use that adversely impacts the availability of refuges and understorey complexity such as removal of fallen logs and rattans. This study also demonstrates the application of the occupancy approach in the study of small and elusive ungulates.\\'Abstract: \\'A long-standing view of Indian biodiversity is that while rich in species, there are few endemics or in-situ radiations within the subcontinent. One exception is the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, an isolated mountain range with many endemic species. Understanding the origins of the montane-restricted species is crucial to illuminate both taxonomic and environmental history.\\'Abstract: \\' Summary. Two new species of Brachystelma: B. mahajanii Kambale & S. R. Yadav from Ebbanad, Nilgiri District, Tamil Nadu and B. vartakii Kambale & S. R.

Based on this premise, endophytes have been regarded as a focal group for estimating fungal numbers because their possible hyperdiverse nature would reflect significantly global fungal diversity. We present our consolidated ten-year work on 75 dicotyledonous tree hosts belonging to 33 families and growing in three different types of tropical forests of the NBR in the Western Ghats, southern India. We conclude that endophyte diversity in these forests is limited due to loose host affiliations among endophytes. Some endophytes have a wide host range and colonize taxonomically disparate hosts suggesting adaptations in them to counter a variety of defense chemicals in their hosts. Furthermore, such polyphagous endophytes dominate the endophyte assemblages of different tree hosts. Individual leaves may be densely colonized but only by a few endophyte species. It appears that the environment (the type of forest in this case) has a larger role in determining the endophyte assemblage of a plant host than the taxonomy of the host plant. Thus, different tropical plant communities have to be studied for their endophyte diversity to test the generalization that endophytes are hyperdiverse in the tropics, estimate their true species richness, and use them as a predictor group for more accurate assessment of global fungal diversity.\\'seeds and axenic seedling-derived rhizomes\\'Abstract: \\'An efficient protocol has been devised for the propagation and field establishment of Eulophia cullenii (Wight) Bl., a terrestrial orchid having ornamental potentialities, and is critically endangered in Western Ghats, India. Seeds extracted from capsules germinated in MS, MS, Knudson C, or Mitra liquid medium developed into protocorms in Supplementation of organic additives like coconut water, peptone, yeast extract, and casein acid hydrolysate (CH) significantly enhanced protocorm growth. Upon subculture onto agar-gelled Mitra medium fortified with 0.05% CH, 56% of protocorms regenerated into shoots through the formation of linear mini-rhizomes. The regenerated shoots grew vigorously in MS, producing new rhizomes. Mature rhizomes from axenic seedlings produced maximum shoots/whole rhizome in MS fortified with 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), in Horizontal and longitudinal halves of the rhizome also gave multiple shoots in the presence of BAP. Shoots or shoot clumps sub-cultured onto MS basal medium produced roots followed by rhizomes in Seedlings with mature rhizomes showed 70% establishment in the nursery and added a new rhizome at the end of one growth cycle. An average of 70.6% of the rhizomes originating from seedlings during the second growth cycle sprouted to produce new shoots, when planted in the native localities. Asymbiotic germination and cloning through rhizomes thus can provide a large number of vigorous plants of E. cullenii for ornamental exploitation as well as eco-restoration, if rhizome as storage organ is ensured in the propagule.\\'Abstract: \\'Macro and microhabitat analyses were applied to characterise the fish assemblage structure in 10 streams of the Western Ghat mountains of Peninsular India. Macrohabitat features, such as channel gradient, stream depth, stream width, riparian cover, instream cover, habitat types and substrates, were used. Microhabitat requirements of the abundant cyprinids (35 species) were also analysed. Macrohabitat assessment indicated that a high habitat diversity was associated with a high species diversity, and that habitat volume was a major determining factor for species diversity and abundance. In all streams, cyprinids were the dominant group in the assemblage and almost all cyprinids were confined to pools with a varied habitat diversity. Riffle dwelling species included ancient forms such as Glyptothorax madraspatnum, G. trewasae and Homaloptera santhamparaiensis. Suitable microhabitats for dominant cyprinid species were pools and riffle edges. Big-sized barbs and mahseers such as Hypselobarbus dobsoni, H. curmuca, H. dubius, Labeo calbasu, Puntius sarana, Tor khudree and Tor khudree malabaricus were confined to deep pools with a large area. Smaller Puntius species like P. fasciatus, P. melanampyx, P. narayani, P. sophore, P. ticto and P. vittatus lived in shallow backwater pools and pools with low flow. Species like P. arulius tambiraparniei, P. amphibius, P. bimaculatus and P. filamentosus were found towards shallow pools with moderate flow. Surface-dwelling species such as Danio aequipinnatus, Rasbora daniconius, Salmostoma spp. and Barilius spp. preferred deepwater habitats with high flow. Habitat-based multivariate analysis revealed four guilds: surface dwellers, column dwellers, generalized bottom dwellers and specialized bottom dwellers.\\'Abstract: \\'We performed desiccation and storage trials to better understand storage behavior of Knema attenuata seeds. Mature seeds with moisture content (MC) of 31% exhibited 73% germination. During the period of desiccation (open lab condition) seeds with MC 23% showed 40% germination. After further drying to MC 21% germination was reduced to 16%. Complete loss in viability resulted when seed moisture was reduced to 18%. The seeds stored at and (open lab condition) lost their viability within 10 days. Seeds stored in sealed polythene bags and moist sand retained viability for more days than did seeds stored under all other storage conditions. Sensitivity of seeds to lower temperature and desiccation suggest that the storage behavior of K. attenuata seeds is recalcitrant. Seeds stored in moist conditions can, at best, be stored for a period of two months.\\'Abstract: \\'Spatial and temporal trends of invasion by Ochlandra travancorica, a native reed bamboo species were studied. The study was carried out in Agasthyamalai Biosphere reserve, Western Ghats, India. Multi-temporal satellite images from 1973 to 2012 were utilized to map the areas of occurrence of the species. The largest areal extent of the species was calculated to be in the recent time, at which the invasion process reached its saturation phase. The species was found to be a generalist, with no preferred inclination towards any particular topographic or climatic zone. Evergreen forests were established to be its closest associate with largest area followed by semi evergreen and moist deciduous forests within buffer distances of 100, 200 and A threatening of evergreen forests were revealed to have been converted to pure reed bamboos. Overlay analysis showed the oldest and the newest surviving patches of pure reed bamboos in the landscape of Agasthyamalai. The study realizes the significance of remote sensing and GIS in mapping and monitoring of invasive species. We suggest periodical monitoring of reed bamboo areas to check its growth, spread and establishment in order to ensure conservation of Western Ghats.\\'Abstract: \\'Habitat fragmentation is postulated to be a major factor influencing infectious disease dynamics in wildlife populations and may also be responsible, at least in part, for the recent spurt in the emergence, or re-emergence, of infectious diseases in humans. The mechanism behind these relationships are poorly understood due to the lack of insights into the interacting local factors and insufficient baseline data in ecological parasitology of wildlife. Here, we studied the gastrointestinal parasites of nonhuman mammalian hosts living in 10 rainforest patches of the Anamalai Tiger Reserve, India. We examined 349 faecal samples of 17 mammalian species and successfully identified 24 gastrointestinal parasite taxa including 1 protozoan, 2 trematode, 3 cestode and 18 nematode taxa. Twenty of these parasites are known parasites of humans. We also found that as much as 73% of all infected samples were infected by multiple parasites. In addition, the smallest and most fragmented forest patches recorded the highest parasite richness; the pattern across fragments, however, seemed to be less straightforward, suggesting potential interplay of local factors.\\'Abstract: \\'Phenological studies help to analyze resource abundance and feeding ecology of some herbivorous primate species. The rainforest between the rivers Aghnashini and Sharavathy in Karnataka, India, is one of the richest primate habitats in the country. Plant resource availability was studied in this forest using belt transect and plot methods. More than 800 trees of 71 species were considered for phenology sampling, and the tree species used by primates for consumption of leaves, flowers and fruits were selected for availability monitoring. Flush leaves were available throughout the year. The availability of mature leaves and flowers was highest in pre-summer Unripe and ripe fruits were mostly available in summer The availability of these resources showed significant seasonal variation. The availability and abundance of plant food resources throughout the year, presence of keystone species and broad food niches probably account for the presence of a high density of primates including 32, 47 and 151 groups of lion-tailed macaques, bonnet macaques and Hanuman langurs respectively in about of this forest making this region a model for primate conservation.\\'Abstract: \\'Water quality assessment and freshwater fish diversity of Bhadra river, Western Ghats, Karnataka was examined. River water was clear except at one station (BV Site) with rocky and sandy substrate. The mean water quality of study sites were as following, air temperature water temperature dissolved oxygen total hardness alkalinity (as CaCO3), conductivity COD and BOD respectively. Altogether, 56 species of fish representing 31 genera and 15 families were recorded. The Cyprinid family was dominant in the present study. Various diversity index packages have been used to assess the fish diversity. Fish diversity is also correlated with physicochemical variables.\\'Abstract: \\'Tree diversity cm gbh) in undisturbed and human-impacted tropical evergreen forest sites was investigated in the Kolli hills, Eastern Ghats, India. Four 2-ha contiguous permanent plots were erected, one each in Perumakkai shola (site PS), Vengodai shola (VS), Kuzhivalavu shola (KS) and Mottukkadu shola (MS) at 1000, 1050, 1200 and 1250 m elevation, with increasing human disturbance, to evaluate the difference in tree species composition, stand structure and dynamics. This paper discusses the results of the first survey. A total of 3825 individuals and 78 species from 61 genera and 36 families were enumerated in the 8 ha area. Among the four 2-ha sites, species richness was greatest (58) in the undisturbed site PS and lowest (39) in the highly disturbed site MS. Shannon, Simpson, Hill diversity and evenness indexes revealed a progressive reduction in diversity with increasing disturbance. The asymptote species-area curves imply adequate site sampling. Tree density (1151 to 651 trees and basal area (106 to 46.6 m2 decreased from undisturbed to disturbed site, due to selective felling. Single species, Memecylon umbellatum dominated sites MS (39%) and VS (26%), while Nothopegia heyneana, Memecylon umbellatum and Diospyros ovalifolia were dominant in PS, and Meliosma simplicifolia, Myristica dactyloides and Phoebe wightii in KS. Based on species abundance, we classify the study area as association with Neolitsea and Myristica as codominants. Tree population structure revealed a step-wise decline in girth frequencies with increasing size class in undisturbed site PS, whereas tree density fell sharp (>50%) in medium girth class in the disturbed site MS. Population of the dominant species varied widely. The diversity values of this inventory are compared with similar studies in India and other tropical forests. Evidently, the reduction in species richness (by 52%), basal area (56%) and tree density (58%) in disturbed sites, with 57.6% of species rarity of this tropical evergreen forest, in secluded patches of Kolli hills, underlines conservation need to prevent species loss.\\'Abstract: \\'Studies on the effects of tropical rainforest fragmentation and disturbance have often focussed on plants and vertebrates such as birds and mammals and seldom on invertebrates, despite the latter being among the most biologically diverse groups in these ecosystems. Spiders are one such group of invertebrate predators that are known to be sensitive indicators of environmental change in tropical ecosystems. The present study assesses the spider community structure and responses to rainforest fragmentation and degradation and conversion to shade-coffee plantations in the Anamalai hills, southern Western Ghats, India. Ten rainforest fragments ranging in size from to under varying levels of degradation within the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary and private lands of the Valparai plateau, and two shade-coffee plantation sites were sampled for spiders using visual searches along time-constrained belt transects between January and May 2005. Within a total sampled area of 4,565 individual spiders (4,300 detections) belonging to 156 morphospecies within 21 families and 8 functional groups were recorded. The estimated total number of understorey spider species in the study area was 192 species, representing around 13% of the total number of spider species so far described from India. Overall spider density, species richness, and species density showed no trend in relation to fragment area across all sites. Specific comparisons among undisturbed sites indicated however that high altitude sites had fewer species than mid-altitude sites and fragments had fewer species than relatively larger continuous forest sites. In contrast to the lack of trend in overall species richness and abundance, species composition changed substantially in relation to habitat alteration and altitude. Cluster analysis of Bray-Curtis similarities among sites in spider species composition revealed four distinct clusters: high altitude undisturbed sites, mid-altitude disturbed sites with an undisturbed mid altitude site, mid-altitude highly disturbed sites with a disturbed site, and shade-coffee plantation sites. Spider species, such as Psechrus torvus and Tylorida culta, that contributed significantly to the dissimilarity between undisturbed and disturbed rainforest sites, and rainforest and shade-coffee sites were identified that serve as useful indicators of habitat alteration.\\'Abstract: \\'Regulation of streamflow by a reservoir creates a flow regime much different from the pre-impoundment period flow regime. Hydro-Electric Projects (HEPs) commissioned in the Western Ghat regions of the Kerala State, India during the last four decades caused considerable changes in the flow regimes of the rivers of the Kerala State in southwest India. In this paper, the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) approach proposed by Richter et al. (1996) is used to analyze flow regime changes in the Periyar and Muvattupuzha Rivers, due to the construction of the Idukki (1976), Idamalayar (1987) and Lower Periyar (1997) HEPs in the high ranges of the Western Ghats. Normal rainfall years (annual rainfall values within mean 0.75 standard deviation limits) are only considered in the analysis to focus on hydrologic alterations due to human activities. The mean hydrologic alteration in the Periyar River (deviation from the pre-development hydrologic indicator values) after commissioning of three HEPs is 35%. Inter-basin water transfer after power generation from the Idukki HEP resulted in a higher discharge in the adjacent Muvattupuzha River, leading to considerable changes in the hydro-environment (mean hydrologic alterations varying between 57 to 63%). IHA parameters showing hydrologic alterations above the 67th Percentile were further analyzed. For each of the pre-construction hydrologic parameters 1 standard deviation from the mean is set as the upper and lower management target limits. The values of each IHA parameter beyond these targets are considered as non-attainment. Considerable hydrologic alterations are observed, especially for low flows in both basins. Inter-basin transfer induced larger changes in flow parameters compared to intra-basin regulations. The study shows that under a proper water release and diversion scheme, the non-attainment of IHA parameters (values fall beyond the target limits) can be reduced. The findings of the study will be greatly beneficial to regional water management and restoration of an eco-environmental system in the humid tropical region.\\'Abstract: \\'Vigna khandalensis (Santapau) Raghavan et Wadhwa, is an endemic legume belonging to subgenus Ceratotropis (Asian Vigna), genus Vigna of the family Fabaceae. It is commonly known as or V. khandalensis is sporadically distributed at high altitude areas in the Northern Western Ghats, India. It is an annual, erect, tall herb growing along roadsides, hilly slopes, pond sides and near human settlements. The legume seeds are utilized by human beings at the time of famine. Surprisingly, the plant remains neglected and underutilized although its high nutritional value. The scant information on V. khandalensis leads us to investigate this underexploited and underutilized legume as a food source for human. The present paper deals with geographical distribution, taxonomy, ecology, agro-morphological characterization, nutritional content and phytochemical analysis. The results obtained in the present investigation provide information on agro-morphological traits and nutritional potential of V. khandalensis. Furthermore, it is promoted as a legume for the for food security.\\'Abstract: \\'The objective of this study is to present a methodological approach to assess the inherent vulnerability of forests and apply it to a case study. Addressing inherent vulnerability, resulting from current stresses, is a necessary step for building resilience to long-term climate change. The proposed approach includes use of analytical framework that enables selection of vulnerability criteria and indicators systematically, application of pairwise comparison method (PCM) for assigning weights, and synthesis of a composite vulnerability index. This methodological approach has been applied at local scale to Aduvalli Protected Forest in Western Ghats in South India, where a vulnerability index value of 0.248 is estimated. Results of the case study indicate that of invasive and forest dependence of community are the major sources of vulnerability at present for Aduvalli Protected Forest. Adoption of this methodology can assist in development of forest management plans to enhance adaptability of Aduvalli PF to current as well as future stresses, including climate change. This methodological approach can be applied across forest-types after appropriate changes to criteria and indicators and their weights, to estimate the inherent vulnerability to enable development of adaptation strategy.\\'Abstract: \\'Carbon stock distribution in the protected areas (PAs) of India is rarely studied, although they constitute 21.34% of the geographical area under forest cover. A quantitative assessment of ecosystem service is used here to evaluate the PAs of India in terms of storage and spatial distribution of carbon stocks. The area selected for the study was Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR), in the Southern Western Ghats, a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site. Carbon storage on a land parcel largely depends on the amount of five carbon pools: aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, dead wood, litter, and soil organic matter. The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model uses land cover types and data on the stocks in the five carbon pools to estimate the amount of carbon stored in a landscape. The InVEST model is multiservice and has a modular design that provides an effective tool for exploring the likely outcomes of alternative management and climate scenarios and for evaluating trade-offs among sectors and services. The results showed that the average carbon (C) stock in the study area was and a sum of 15.43 million tons were stored in PTR. The multiservice, modular design of the ecosystem service analysis provides decision-makers an effective tool for evaluating and managing natural resources.\\'Abstract: \\'This paper introduces a new statistical method that we recommend should become standard procedure to quantify the goodness-of-fit of calibration and validation for land-use change models. We present a multiple-resolution Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC) that measures the goodness-of-fit between a reference map, which is considered reality, and a simulated map, which is a output. This proposed ROC is based on: (1) multiple-resolutions, (2) soft classification, (3) sampling without replacement, and 4) explicit separation of factors of quantity versus location of land-use change. We illustrate the method with a case study in Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot, where we have maps of cumulative forest disturbance for 1920 and 1990. We use a predictive modeling approach similar to GEOMOD in which we calibrate the model with the map of 1920, then predict the map of 1990, at which point we subject the model to validation. We show that the fit of calibration tends to be much larger than the fit of validation. Thus if a modeler assess a model by goodness-of-fit of calibration only, then the modeler will likely be over confident in the predictive ability.\\'Abstract: \\'A total of 3611 fungal isolates were recovered from 4200 leaf segments incubated from 7 medicinal herbs during monsoon, winter and summer seasons. These fungal isolates belonged to teleomorphic Ascomycota (23.5%), anamorphic Ascomycota producing conidiomata (17.4%), anamorphic Ascomycota without conidiomata (46.9%), Zygomycota (1.42%) and sterile forms (10.6%). Chaetomium globosum, Aspergillus niger, Aureobasidium pullulans, Curvularia lunata, Fusarium spp., Penicillium spp., Pestalotiopsis spp., Trichoderma viridae, Cladosporium cladosporioides, were frequently isolated from more than one host plant. The number of endophytic isolates was higher in winter than in monsoon and summer seasons.\\'Abstract: \\'The distribution and availability of food was examined to see how it influenced ranging patterns and sleeping site selection in a group of lion-tailed macaques. The home range and core area were kernel) and kernel) respectively. The lion-tailed macaques had a longer day range, had a greater number of sleeping sites and used more core areas in the summer as compared to the monsoon and the post-monsoon seasons. The ranging patterns and sleeping site use were influenced by the major food resources used in a particular season. The ranging was mainly influenced by Artocarpus heterophyllus in monsoon, Cullenia exarillata and Toona ciliata in post- monsoon, and Artocarpus heterophyllus and Ficus amplissima in summer. The distribution of these four plant species is, therefore, critical to ranging, and thus to conservation of the lion-tailed macaque.\\'Abstract: \\'Parental care has evolved many times in multiple taxa and, by definition, enhances offspring survivorship. Anurans exhibit a diverse array of parental care behaviors, but studies examining their adaptive significance in an evolutionary context are limited. The critically endangered bush frog, Raorchestes chalazodes (Rhacophoridae), only breeds inside hollow internodes of the endemic bamboo (Ochlandra travancorica) in the southern Western Ghats of India from June through October. From systematic surveys, we established that adult males are sole caregivers exhibiting egg attendance and egg guarding behavior. Predation was the main cause of egg mortality in the absence of an attending male; the majority of predation events were caused by conspecific males. The results highlight the role of regional and microhabitat-specific selection pressures such as strong seasonality, limited resources, and competition for oviposition sites. Oviposition sites are in high demand, but in short supply and by consuming unattended eggs, the conspecific male may benefit from nutritional gains as well as mating opportunities at the oviposition site. Our work lays foundations for further examination of social and reproductive behaviors of anurans not only in the Western Ghats but also in South and Southeast Asia.\\'Abstract: \\'We used standard isolation protocols to explore the endophytic fungal communities in three tissue types of two dominant orchids (Bulbophyllum neilgherrense and Vanda testacea) of the Kaiga forest of the Western Ghats. We surface sterilized and assessed 90 segments of each orchid for the occurrence and diversity of endophytic fungal taxa. The 118 fungal isolates were obtained from root, bulb and leaves of B. neilgherrense, consisting of 17 anamorphic taxa (range, taxa) with 1.3 fungal taxa per segment (range, taxa). Four taxa (Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Penicillium sp. and morpho sp. 1) belonged to the core group The relative abundance of A. flavus and morpho sp. 1 was more than 10%. A total of 130 fungal isolates from roots, stems and leaves of V. testacea yielded 20 anamorphic taxa (range, taxa) with 1.4 fungal taxa per segment (range, taxa). Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, A. ochraceus, Gliocladium viride, Penicillium sp. and morpho sp. 1 belonged to the core group. Relative abundance exceeded 10% for A. flavus, A. niger, and morpho sp. 1. The Simpson and Shannon diversity indices were higher in leaf than root or bulb/stem of both orchids. similarity coefficient was higher between root and leaf in both orchids (56.3%-60%) than between other pairs. Our study revealed that the endophytic fungal assemblage and diversity of B. neilgherrense and V. testacea of Kaiga forest of the Western Ghats were relatively similar between orchids and their tissues.\\'Abstract: \\'We assessed soil fungal diversity in the dry deciduous forest of a Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary of the Western Ghats (210.31 m a.s.l.; N and Soil samples were collected by random mixed sampling during winter (November, 2008), summer (March, 2009) and monsoon (August, 2009) seasons, and physico-chemical parameters were recorded. During winter, summer, and monsoon seasons, 49, 45 and 49 of fungal species belongs to 20, 18 and 19 of genera were isolated, respectively. Isolated soil fungi were mainly of the Mitosporic fungi, followed by Zygomycotina, Ascomycotina, Oomycotina and Coelomycetes. Indices of diversity, dominance and fisher alpha during winter, summer and monsoon seasons were 3.756, 3.638 and 3.738 0.9737, 0.9694 and 0.9726 (1-D) and 18.84, 29.83 and 19.46 respectively. (r) correlation coefficient of fungal population with physico-chemical parameters of soils showed significantly positive and negative correlations (p<0.01) during winter, summer and monsoon seasons. Physico-chemical soil parameters played an important role in the occurrence, diversity, distribution, and relative abundance of fungal species in the tropical dry deciduous forest soil.\\'Abstract: \\'Pot experiments were conducted to assess the efficacy of three arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi viz. Glomus fasciculatum, Funneliformis mosseae and Acaulospora the growth of Vatica chinensis. Plants grown in the presence of AM fungi generally showed an increase in growth and biomass over those grown in the absence of AM fungal inoculation. It was observed that a consortium of AM fungi without organic manure was found to be the best treatment to enhance plant biomass. The plant height, number of leaves and plant dry and fresh matter, plant P and N contents varied significantly with treatments. The AM colonization was higher in the seedling roots inoculated with two or three AM fungi. This study indicated that the inoculation with AM fungi either alone or in combination improved the growth, biomass yield and phosphorus nutrition of V. chinensis compared to that of the control. This information may be helpful to improve the growth of these species in sustainable forestry program.\\'Abstract: \\'Nutrient composition of the manure of four pill millipedes (Arthrosphaera dalyi, A. davisoni, A. fumosa and A. magna) inhabiting in semi-evergreen forests and plantations of the Western Ghats of Southwest India was evaluated. The quantity and quality of fecal pellets differed between millipedes and their habitats (forest and plantation). Organic carbon content in manure was lower in plantations than in forests, while nitrogen content was elevated in plantations. The carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of manure was lower in plantations compared to forests. The phosphorus content in manure was elevated in plantations in all except for A. dalyi. Calcium content of manure was increased in plantations than in forests. The contents of magnesium, potassium and phenolics in manure showed varied results. The mass of fecal pellets was correlated only with volume in forests (r=0.882; p < 0.01) and pH in plantations (r=0.616; p < 0.05), while the volume of fecal pellets was correlated with nitrogen content in forests (r=0.751; p < 0.01) and calcium in plantations p < 0.05). The conductivity was positively correlated with phosphorus and potassium, while magnesium was negatively correlated in forests as well as plantations. Potassium and magnesium were negatively correlated in forests p < 0.001) and plantations (r=0.692; p < 0.05). Overall, the physicochemical characteristics and nutrient composition of fecal pelets differed between millipedes as well as habitats. The low carbon to nitrogen ratio and the increased nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium content in the manure of millipedes inhabiting in plantations indicates possibilities for successfully employing them for in situ composting of forest or plantation residues.\\'Abstract: \\'The Western Ghats (India) is a region of high biological diversity and endemicity of terrestrial fauna, but very little is known about its freshwater species distributions. Four rivers, Sharavati, Aghanashini, Bedti and Kali, of the central Western Ghats were studied for their fish diversity and composition. A total species richness of 92 species (and an endemicity of 25%) was reported. A comparison of expected species richness (SR) estimates using different statistical estimators was made these showed the expected SR to be in the range of species. Many of the species were found to be shared with those belonging to the southern Western Ghats, but the study also unearthed new findings in terms of description of a new species and extension of the known distribution range of some of the species. The study at varying spatial and temporal scales also showed that while the rivers are very similar to each other in terms of the SR values, they do vary with respect to the species composition. Species compositions across upper (or lower) reaches of these rivers were found to be more similar to one another than the upstream and downstream reaches in the same river. Temporal patterns, with regard to diurnal activity of fishes were studied. These showed that of the 72 species collected at night, 29 were exclusive to night sampling. Though much of the information of the feeding and habitat preferences of the fishes in this region is lacking, it is speculated that the differences in their activity patterns could be related to feeding and predator avoidance.\\'Abstract: \\'Diurnal periodicity of abundance (total, male and female) and behavior (resting, feeding and croaking) of the frogs Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis, E. hexadactylus and Hoplobatrachus tigerinus inhabiting in ponds of the Western Ghats at different altitudes (high, mid and foothill) have been investigated during three seasons (monsoon, post-monsoon and summer). Irrespective of seasons, the air and water temperatures were significantly lower during night than day in all locations and the humidity was significantly higher in high-altitude than other locations. Total abundance was significantly high only during night in mid-altitude inhabiting frog E. hexadactylus The resting behavior was significantly lower during night than day in all frogs, while it was opposite for croaking behavior. The feeding behavior was significantly higher during day than night in E. cyanophlyctis Total abundance was significantly correlated with abundance of females. Three hourly observations up to revealed consistently high total as well as female abundance during monsoon than other seasons. The resting and feeding behaviors of frogs gradually decreased from day towards night, while croaking behavior gradually increased from onwards and reached a peak at and decreased further. Studies on the influence of environmental variables on the behavior of frogs in their native/natural habitats and in mesocosms will be rewarding to follow up their rehabilitation and conservation.\\'Abstract: \\' Mating behaviour of four species of pill-millipedes under genus Arthrosphaera Pocock (Arthrosphaera dalyi Pocock and Arthrosphaera disticta Pocock, Arthrosphaera fumosa Pocock and Arthrosphaera magna Attems) endemic to the Western Ghats of Southern India was analyzed in mesocosms. Stridulation is a classical communication signal in males as well as females for mate selection. Conglobation (or volvation) is a mechanism of defence to protect from disturbance or avoid predation. If male touches female or vice versa they conglobate. To avoid disparity among individuals of the same species, volvating pill-millipedes evolved stridulation behaviour for communication. The male broadcasts appropriate signal to female through stridulation to advertise its interest in mating. The females test the fitness by conglobation and suitable male uncoils the partner through stridulation signals. Male with its pygidium successfully uncoils the female and attains suitable orientation for courtship. Male pairs with female contact in opposite direction to deposit sperm into the vulva of female. The duration of mating varies from species to species and usually a lapse from 3 to Vibration generated by stridulation is species-specific and its perception mechanism in pill-millipedes is yet to be clearly understood. Present study emphasized the structure of stridulatory organs, mechanism of stridulation and pattern of mating behaviour in four species of pill-millipedes.\\'Abstract: \\'The changes in species composition, abundance and forest stand structure were analyzed across altitudinal regimes in tropical forests of Eastern Ghats of northern Andhra Pradesh, India. Three 1-ha plots were established with one each in low, medium and high altitudes. A total of 153 species, 2129 stems (709 stems of cm girth were enumerated. Species richness and diversity pattern varied along altitudinal gradient and increased with the altitude. Species richness varied from 52 to 110 and stand density from 639 to 836 with average basal area of 34.39 Shannon-Wiener index ranged from 4.55 to 5.17. Low altitude (i.e., Site 1) is dominated by Xylia xylocarpa (59.22) and Lagerstroemia parviflora (23.90), medium altitude (i.e., Site 2) by Xylia xylocarpa (45.50) Bursera serrata (17.29), and high altitude (i.e., Site 3) has Schleichera oleosa (28.25) Pterocarpus marsupium (26.55) as predominant species. Taxonomically, Rubiaceae (12 species), Fabaceae (12), Euphorbiaceae (11), Rutaceae (7) and Lauraceae (7) were dominant families. Density-wise, Fabaceae, Combretaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Anacardiaceae and Myrtaceae were abundant. Thus, conservation assessment based on altitudinal regimes and the information on species structure and function can provide baseline information for monitoring and sustaining the biodiversity.\\'Abstract: \\'A new species of Gymnostachyum Nees (Acanthaceae), G. warrieranum K. M. P. Kumar, Balach. & V. B. Sreek. from the Western Ghats of India is described and illustrated. IUCN status, distribution, phenetic relationships, phenology and plastid genome variation are discussed and a key to the Gymnostachyum species distributed in Kerala is also provided for easy identification.\\'Abstract: \\'Even since Linnaeus, naturalists and taxonomists have been systematically describing species new to science. Besides indicating gaps in taxonomic effort, understanding the temporal patterns of species discovery could help in identifying drivers that determine discovery. In this study we report the patterns of discovery of eight taxa birds, butterflies, frogs, tiger beetles, grasses, asters, ferns and orchids in the Western Ghats, a megadiversity centre in India. Our results indicate that the discovery curves for birds and butterflies have been saturated while those for frogs and grasses continue to increase. Within each taxon, the major drivers of discovery were commonness of the species and their size. The average years taken for discovery across taxa were directly related to the per cent endemicity and species richness of the taxa. We discuss the trajectories of discovery with respect to rarity or endemicity of the species and life history features, and the implications these might have for strategizing the discovery process in India.\\'Abstract: \\'Caecilians are legless amphibians quite characteristic of the Western Ghats. Fourteen out of 16 Indian species occur in the Western Ghats and all are endemic. The present paper deals with the biology of caecilians with reference to external morphology and general breeding behaviour. It consolidates information on 26 morphological parameters which are used in caecilian identification. Metric multidimensional scaling of 16 species of caecilians using pair-wise euclidian distances calculated on the basis of 11 important morphometric parameters clearly depicts morphological distances between different species and more so the genera, thereby validating the classification. A field guide has been developed for the identification of caecilians based on a survey made all over the Western Ghats, observation of holotypes at the Natural History Museum, London and review of the literature. The study also reveals the microhabitat requirements of the caecilians. Further, the localities of caecilian distribution in the Western Ghats are mapped. The taxonomy of Indian caecilians is discussed.\\'Abstract: \\'There are no comprehensive reports available on impact of shaded and un-shaded coffee agrosystems on soil biology and microbiological processes. The present study compared the changes in soil biological and microbiological attributes along with coffee quality under different levels of shade and elevation for coffee in India. Significantly higher bulk density was observed in low elevation with open patch/no shade (LEOP) as compared to high elevation with thick shade (HETS). Low elevation with thick shade (LETS) recorded significantly higher water holding capacity as compared to high elevation with open patch (HEOP) Significantly higher organic carbon was observed in samples from shaded area as compared to no shade As compared to low elevation, higher available nitrogen available phosphorus and exchangeable potassium content was found to be significantly higher in samples of high elevation. Significantly higher soil respiration rate and urease activity was observed in the treatment LEOP, whereas higher dehydrogenase and fluorescein diacetate activity were indicated in HETS and HEOP treatments respectively. High elevation with thick or no shade treatments indicated significantly higher soil micro and macro-fauna population as compared to low elevation with thick or no shade. Significantly higher microbial population was recorded in HETS followed by LETS, whereas Shannon diversity index dominance index (D), and Shannon evenness (SE) were found to be similar for HETS, HEOP, and LETS treatments. Better cup characteristics were observed with coffee grown at HETS in comparison with low elevation grown coffee.\\'Abstract: \\' Artocarpus altilis (Park.) Fosberg is an important fruit vegetable tree grown in the homesteads of southern part of India. To provide reasoned scientific management practices and conservation measures, the pattern of morphological and genetic variation were investigated for six populations using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers and 15 morphological traits. The use of five selective primer combinations on 60 samples resulted a total of 414 bands in which 85% were polymorphic. The values of genetic distance varied from 0.0044 to 0.3376 Analysis of molecular variance revealed most of the variation within populations (57.45%) than (42.55%) among populations. The genetic variation by AFLP data is not reflected in quantitative morphological variables. However, the genetic and geographical distances were positively correlated which were further well supported by the PCO analysis and Dollo-parsimony tree, both show the tendency of the individuals to group according to the geographical localities.\\'Abstract: \\'Freshwater crabs of the Western Ghats have been severely underestimated in their diversity. Since freshwater crabs have a small spatial scale endemism, many remote and poorly studied localities in the Western Ghats need to be surveyed. In this study, a new genus and new species is described.\\'Abstract: \\'Remote sensing offers fast and reliable technique to map the variation in plant diversity and distribution at different scales. Using 891 geo-tagged ground sampled point collected for the Western Ghats, India from a national level study on biodiversity characterization. We analyzed the distribution of plant species with respect to the satellite derived vegetation indices. The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer derived vegetation products, i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), leaf area index (LAI), and surface reflectance (SR-645nm and SR-858nm) were fitted to suitable regression curves with respect to plant species richness where NDVI demonstrated the best fit while fPAR showed better relation with woody species richness. We observed positive but weak correlation for all the biophysiological proxies with species richness in the forests of Western Ghats. The annual pattern of correlation faired than seasonal (i.e., post-monsoon) between biophysical variables and species richness, while the woody subset of the species richness demonstrated marginally better relation at annual scale. The range of each biophysical proxy varied from medium to high, indicating higher vegetation strength. The species richness trend increased linearly for NDVI and EVI. The positive correlation showed by fPAR and LAI could be due to varied canopy architecture of the Western Ghats forests. Utility of fine resolution spatio-temporal data could render better understanding of species richness pattern using biophysical proxies, and thereby, help in long-term biodiversity monitoring.\\'Abstract: \\' A survey of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) status of plants growing in the Western Ghats region of Southern India was undertaken. Root and soil samples of plants growing in the four vegetation types forest, grassland, scrub, and cultivated land or plantation were examined. Of the 329 species (representing 61 families) examined, 174 were mycorrhizal. AM association was recorded in 81 species for the first time, including species from several families assumed to be non-mycorrhizal, e.g. Amaranthaceae, Capparaceae, Commelinaceae, Cyperaceae and Portulacaceae. AM fungal spores of 35 species belonging to Acaulospora, Gigaspora, Glomus, Sclerocystis and Scutellospora were recorded. AM fungal species richness was found to be highest in scrub and lowest in agricultural and plantation soils. Mean colonization levels were dependent on plant life-form, life-cycle pattern and vegetation type.\\'Abstract: \\'The Western Ghats form a major mountain belt, next to the Himalayas, in controlling the flux of water and carbon to the northern Indian Ocean. This study attempts to understand the water and carbon cycles in two humid tropical river basins with its streams originating at higher altitudes of the Western Ghats, India. Water and suspended particulate matter (SPM) were collected on a monthly scale during summer monsoon season (June-September) from Swarna and Nethravati rivers draining into the Arabian Sea. For the source apportionment, samples have been measured for stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water and stable isotopes of carbon in particulate organic matter (POM) at spatial scale from tributaries and main channel of rivers, and runoff water from agricultural land (dominant paddy field) and forest in the downstream region. The association between and deuterium-excess in river water and rain water shows that water in these tropical basins depicts rainout effect of marine source moisture during the onset of summer monsoon. As the monsoon intensifies, the fresher rain water replenishes older water stored previously in sub surface soil layer leading to its flushing into the river during summer monsoon season. Stable carbon isotope ratio and elemental ratio of POM = -27.1 0.4 and C/N = 8.1 1.7) in two humid tropical river water during summer monsoon season is an admixture of suspended particulates from runoff water of forest = - 27.82 0.4 and agricultural land = -26.29 0.4 It is found that shows minimal variability with SPM content and C/N ratio within the same organic carbon pool. The study emphasizes the need to consider the agricultural runoff contribution to the rivers while establishing the global elemental budget and observing the global climate change.\\'Abstract: \\'Teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) is a popular hardwood species native to South and South-East Asia. The possible association of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker with morphological variables of eleven important characters viz. girth at breast height (GBH), height of tree, bole height, branch knots, presence of fluting, spiral stem, leaf hair, leaf length/breadth ratio, branching pattern, bark colour and petiole shape for nine natural populations comprising 180 genotypes of teak (9 populations 20 trees). The phenogram constructed using Euclidean distances for the eleven morphological characters showed that the populations were not grouped according to their geographical origin. The test for pairwise correlation between Euclidean distances of different morphological variables and genetic distances from AFLP data revealed that only petiole character (r =0.269; p =0.046) and height of tree (r =0.200; p =0.001) were significantly correlated with that of AFLP data matrix. The nine populations in this study covered a geographic area of about 1000 km stretch along the Western Ghat of South India. A test of correlation between genetic and geographic distance matrices revealed a significant positive correlation (r =0.475; p =0.009). The lack of perfect congruence between morphological and molecular data except for geographic distance, tree height and petiole character suggested that the morphological system might be useful for the morphotypes management but not appropriate to study the genetic structure of the teak populations.\\'Abstract: \\'A population of the Western Ghats squirrel,Funamhulus tristriatus Waterhouse, was studied for some group attributes. The density ranged between 2 and 4 individuals/ha, the pattern being irregular. The rate of persistence was very low and nearly 83 % of the squirrels marked and released disappeared from the population within 12 months. The sex ratio significantly favoured males. Males were heavier than females, but the difference was not statistically significant.\\'Abstract: \\'A morphometric analysis was carried out to describe the topography and drainage characteristics of Papanasam and Manimuthar watersheds. These watersheds are part of Western Ghats, which is an ecologically sensitive region. The drainage areas of Papanasam and Manimuthar watersheds are 163 and respectively and they show patterns of dendritic to sub-dendritic drainage. The slope of both watersheds varied from to and to respectively. Moreover, the slope variation is chiefly controlled by the local geology and erosion cycles. Each watershed was classified as a fifth-order drainage basin. The stream order of the basin was predominantly controlled by physiographic and structural conditions. The increase in stream length ratio from lower to higher order suggests that the study area has reached a mature geomorphic stage. The development of stream segments is affected by rainfall and local lithology of the watersheds.\\'Abstract: \\'This article reports the structure of dominance and its relationship with social grooming in wild lion-tailed macaque females. The strength of dominance hierarchy was 0.79 on a scale of 0 to 1 indicating a moderate linearity in the ranking system. Dominance scores were converted into an ordinal as well as an interval scale. Grooming scores were also converted into interval scales using standard scores. Grooming received and grooming given correlated positively and negatively respectively with dominance ranks indicating that high ranking females received more and gave less grooming. Grooming was also positively related to encounter rates for dyads of females. More grooming among adjacent ranks, and grooming being more reciprocal, occurred only in the case of dominant females. The grooming patterns, therefore, appeared to be more of despotic than egalitarian nature. While ranking macaques into different Grades of social systems ranging from despotic to egalitarian, Thierry (2004) has placed lion-tailed macaques in Grade 3 corresponding to the social system. Our results indicate that the grooming and dominance relationships in this species are more despotic, and hence, the Grade for this species requires to be shifted toward 2 or 1.\\'Abstract: \\'The study was conducted in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, in the Western Ghats to understand the effect of a single fire event on tree diversity and regeneration status. Four forest patches were selected which were unburned, 2-year-old burn, 5-year-old burn, and 15-year-old burn. Three square plots were laid randomly in all four patches and analyzed for tree diversity, stand structure, and regeneration of tree species.\\'Abstract: \\'The objective of this study is to apply and test a simple parametric water balance model for prediction of soil moisture regime in the presence of vegetation. The intention was to evaluate the differences in model parameterization and performance when applied to small watersheds under three different types of land covers (Acacia, degraded forest and natural forest). The watersheds selected for this purpose are located in the sub-humid climate within the Western Ghats, Karnataka, India. Model calibration and validation were performed using a dataset comprising depth-averaged soil moisture content measurements made at weekly time steps from October 2004 to December 2008. In addition to this, a sensitivity analysis was carried out with respect to the water-holding capacity of the soils with the aim of explaining the suitability and adaptation of exotic vegetation types under the prevailing climatic conditions. Results indicated reasonably good performance of the model in simulating the pattern and magnitude of weekly average soil moisture content in deep soil layer under all three land covers. This study demonstrates that a simple, robust and parametrically parsimonious model is capable of simulating the temporal dynamics of soil moisture content under distinctly different land covers. Also, results of sensitivity analysis revealed that exotic plant species such as Acacia have adapted themselves effectively to the local climate.\\'Abstract: \\'Thirty-six medicinal plant species belonging to 25 families were surveyed to study Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal diversity from different localities of North and South Goa of Western Ghats, Goa region, India. A total of 30 medicinal plant species were found to be mycorrhizal and six plant species showed absence of AM fungal colonization. Forty two AM fungal species belonging to five genera viz., Glomus, Acaulospora, Scutellospora, Gigaspora and Ambispora were recovered from the rhizosphere soil. Glomus was found to be the most dominant genera in the study sites, and Glomus fasciculatum the most dominant AM fungal species. Negative significant correlation was observed between percent colonization and spore density. and Shannon Weiner diversity index studies carried out in North and South Goa exhibited less variation in both the sites, indicating a stable and a diverse plant community.\\'Abstract: \\'The Western Ghats, the bold westerly escarpment of India paralleling the west coast, are characterized by different geologic and geomorphic units formed during different episodes of history. The majority of these present day landforms evolved in response to the tectonic activity that the Western Ghats witnessed during the Tertiary period. The major structural features together with the geomorphic units have predominant role in the occurrence of cataclysmic landslides which the windward slope of Western Ghats witness during the peak monsoon season. The Kerala and Periyar lineaments, which are the sites of minor earthquakes, pass through the study area. Escarpments and structural hill systems are the vulnerable landforms for landslide occurrence. Due to the predominant role of these tectonic and geomorphic features in the capricious change of landforms, a study was carried out in this hilly terrain based on geomorphology. The study of soil, slope morphometry, relative relief, land use/land cover and hydrogeological conditions together with a multidimensional analysis in a GIS environment resulted in classifying the entire area into different landslide susceptible zones based on Bureau of Indian Standards. Moreover, the area is also divided into three zones based on the terrain conditions and the type of landslide occurrence. The methodology can well fit with any area experiencing the same terrain conditions and can be used to classify an area on the basis of landslide occurrence and geomorphology.\\'Abstract: \\'Antler cycles are convenient external signs indicating internal changes in reproductive status of male deer. Antler phenology of chital (Axis axis) and sambar (Rusa unicolor) were studied in a deciduous habitat of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, Western Ghats, using vehicle transects for 2 successive years. Apparent breeding seasonality occurred with the majority of adult stags in hard antlers from May to mid October in chital and October to May in sambar Adult hard antler in chital correlated with mean group size, while sambar showed a weak correlation between adult hard antler and group size. Chitals prefer forming large groups at forest edges and open habitats while sambars prefer dense vegetation cover. Adult hard antlers in chital and sambar showed a weak relation to fawning since most adult females were in oestrus during the peak rutting season. Adult hard antlers in chital associated positively with rainfall and day length while sambar responded weakly to rainfall. We conclude that environmental variables determined species-specific mating strategies in the two deer species.\\'Abstract: current distribution of Cajanus lineatus in the forest area of the Western Ghats including Kumbharli Ghat, Mahabaleshwar, Lonavala, Khandala and Sinhgarh, from where the species was reported earlier, was estimated. The extensive exploration of these areas revealed that Cajanus lineatus is facing severe threat of habitat loss/fragmentation due to anthropogenic activities. Very few fragmented populations with a small number of plants such as one or two individuals were found and most of them had vanished when visited subsequently. The species almost disappeared from most of the native places as urbanization and road constructions have increased importantly. Cajanus lineatus prefers open places, mainly targeted by these activities. Hence, the present situation of the habitat-specific C. lineatus in these areas is alarming and very soon the species will be at the verge ofAbstract: \\'Cynometra travancorica Bedd. belonging to family Fabaceae is an endangered tree species endemic to Western Ghats with restricted distribution. There is an urgent need for conservation of this endangered species and the vegetative propagation techniques can play major role in planting stock production. Present study focuses on the standardisation of vegetative propagation protocol of C. travancorica using stem cuttings with different concentrations of three plant growth regulating substances in different season. The anatomical, physiological and biochemical changes of the sprouted cuttings belonging to different growth regulator treatments were also conducted. Softwood, semi hardwood and hardwood cuttings were collected in three seasons and and treated with indole 3 butyric acid, indole 3 acetic acid and naphthalene acetic acid in different concentrations. Rooting response was measured after in the mist chamber. The adventitious rhizogenesis of C. travancorica stem cuttings was influenced by type of cutting, season of collection, type of growth regulator and its concentration. Semi hardwood cuttings collected during season III treated with IBA recorded about 84% rooting. Anatomical studies on the sprouted cuttings treated with different growth regulator did not show any significant differences, whereas physiological and biochemical parameters of sprouted cuttings varied. Hence, we recommend this treatment combination for the large scale planting stock production.\\'Abstract: \"This study focuses on the mother-child nexus (or process of enculturation) with respect to knowledge and valuation of wild food plants in a context where accelerated processes of modernization and acculturation are leading to the erosion of knowledge and cultural values associated with wild food plant use, in Wayanad, Western Ghats, India. Wild food plants in this biodiversity hotspot form an important part of local diets and are used as famine foods and medicines. In general, the collection and consumption of these foods are increasingly stigmatized as symbols of poverty and \\'tribalness\\' (equivalent to \\'backwardness\\'). The study, which falls within the discipline of ethnobotany, involves three socio-cultural groups the Paniya and Kuruma tribes and non-tribals. Further, it examines the impact in the enculturation process of an unusual educational programme sponsored by the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation that is oriented towards creating awareness among children of cultural identity and local biological resources the study compares children having participated in the programme with those who have not, with their mothers. The process of enculturation is assessed by comparing wild food plant knowledge and values between mothers and their children, and by examining events where knowledge transmission occurs, including collection and consumption. For that, quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis tools were used, and methods included semi-structured interviews, photo identification and informal interviews of key informants.\"Abstract: \\'The Meenachil, the only river that flows through the heart of the Kottayam district of Kerala state, India was selected for the study. The present study has been carried out with an objective to systematically examine the prevalence of indicator and pathogenic microorganisms and to compare the microbiological quality of the river water during the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Water samples from 44 different sites during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons were collected for the analysis. During the pre-monsoon period, the faecal coliform count ranged from 230 to 110,000 while there was a variation from 200 to 4600 during the post-monsoon period. When the faecal streptococci count was analysed, it ranged from 140 to 110,000 during the pre-monsoon and 70 to 4600 during the post-monsoon seasons, respectively. All the samples collected were found to have total viable count (TVC) higher than those prescribed by Bureau of Indian Standards (ISI 1991). Total viable counts were found in the range of to in the pre-monsoon and to in the post-monsoon. The presence of faecal indicator bacteria, Escherichia coli and potentially pathogenic bacteria, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Salmonella enterica in the Meenachil River indicates that the bacteriological quality of the Meenachil River is poor. Moreover, it sheds light to the fact that raw sewage is being dumped into the Meenachil River. Urban runoffs and effluents of rubber factories appear to be the important sources of faecal contamination in the river. From this study, we conclude that these water bodies pose significant public health hazards. Adequate sanitary infrastructure will help in preventing source water contamination. Besides this, public health education aimed at improving personal, household and community hygiene is urgent.\\'in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in India\\'Abstract: \\'Improved understanding of the processes shaping the assembly of tropical tree communities is crucial for gaining insights into the evolution of forest communities and biological diversity. The climate is thought to be the first order determinant of abundance and distribution patterns of tree species with contrasting traits such as evergreen and deciduous leaf phenology. However, the relative role of neutral, and niche-based processes in the evolution of these patterns remain poorly understood.\\'Abstract: \\'We surveyed slender lorises (Loris lydekkerianus) in Karnataka, south India intermittently during November 2004 and estimated their relative abundance via direct sightings. Two subspecies, Loris lydekkerianus lydekkerianus and L. l. malabaricus, with different morphological traits, occur in the eastern drier region and the western wet region of the state, respectively. The distribution of Loris lydekkerianus lydekkerianus is patchy in a small region in the southeast, which contradicts earlier reports of its abundance throughout the state. Loris lydekkerianus malabaricus occurs throughout the Western Ghats as a contiguous population. The encounter rates of Loris lydekkerianus lydekkerianus and L. l. malabaricus are 0.41 individuals/km and 0.21 individuals/km, respectively. Whereas several forest tracts in the distributional range of Loris lydekkerianus malabaricus are protected areas, no such area exists in the distributional range of L. l. lydekkerianus. Loris lydekkerianus faces serious challenges of conservation because it largely occurs in commercial plantations, which can be relatively unstable habitats as harvesting can take place at any time.\\'Abstract: \\'We have quantitatively analyzed the tree species diversity with respect to soil nutrient status in three sites of a sacred forest ecosystem of Niyamgiri hill range, Eastern Ghats, India. Extensive field surveys and sampling were conducted in 3 sites of the hill range: Site 1 Pterocarpus dominated forest (PTF) N and E), Site 2 Mangifera dominated forest (MAF) N and E) and Site 3 Mixed forest (MIF) N and E). A total of 28 families, 42 genera, 46 tree species, and 286 individual trees were recorded on an area of 0.6 ha. Tree density varied between 470 and 490 individuals and average basal area between 3.16 and 10.04 m2 Shannon Index ranged from 2.34 to 4.53, Index ranged from 0.07 to 0.09, and equitability Index ranged from 0.7 to 1.34. The number of individuals was highest in the girth at breast height (GBH) class of cm. The soil nutrient status of the three forest types was related to tree species diversity. The soil pH value of the three sites reflected the slightly acidic nature of the area. Species diversity was positively correlated with organic carbon and phosphorus and negatively with nitrogen, EC and pH. The results of the current study may be helpful to further develop a conservation plan for tree species in tropical sacred forest ecosystems.\\'Abstract: \\'In this study, the effects of changes in historical and projected land use land cover (LULC) on monthly streamflow and sediment yield for the Netravati river basin in the Western Ghats of India are explored using land use maps from six time periods (1972, 1979, 1991, 2000, 2012, and 2030) and the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). The LULC for 2030 is projected using the land change modeller with the assumption of normal growth. The sensitivity analysis, model calibration, and validation indicated that the SWAT model could reasonably simulate streamflow and sediment yield in the river basin. The results showed that the spatial extent of the LULC classes of urban agriculture and water bodies increased, whereas that of forest grassland and bare land decreased from 1972 to 2030. The streamflow increased steadily (7.88%) with changes in LULC, whereas the average annual sediment yield decreased (0.028%) between 1972 and 1991 and increased later (0.029%) until 2012. However, it may increase by 0.43% from 2012 to 2030. The results indicate that LULC changes in urbanization and agricultural intensification have contributed to the increase in runoff, amounting to 428.65 and respectively, and sediment yield, amounting to 348 and respectively, in the catchment area from 1972 to 2030. The proposed methodology can be applied to other river basins for which temporal digital LULC maps are available for better water resource management plans.\\'Abstract: \\'The knowledge of tree age is important for understanding tree growth and forest dynamics. It may be estimated by methods involving growth ring counts, or by methods involving field measurements of growth rates. Direct methods are considered more accurate, but it is not clear if they are appropriate for all species, notably from the humid tropics. In this paper we assess the occurrence of annual growth rings and their utility for age estimation in three tropical tree species, Acrocarpus fraxinifolius, Dalbergia latifolia (Fabaceae) and Syzygium cumini (Myrtaceae), growing in traditional shade coffee plantations of the southern Western Ghats, India. These species previously were described as having or growth rings. We used anatomical studies, field measurements and computational methods to characterise growth rings and assess similarities between directly and indirectly estimated tree ages. Our study revealed that annual growth rings were characterised by different sets of anatomical features per species and were most distinct in the fast-growing deciduous A. fraxinifolius. Growth rates measured in the field showed annual periodicity in all three species, and reflected annual rainfall-drought cycles in D. latifolia and S. cumini. Direct age estimates were most similar to indirect estimates in D. latifolia, and least so in S. cumini. The results of direct age estimation by counting rings are consistent with them being annual in nature in tropical species with distinct and reliable annual growth ring formation. However, for species with poorly defined growth rings, indirect age estimation methods might be more useful.\\'Abstract: \\'The Western Ghats plays a pivotal role in determining the hydrological and hydroclimatic regime of Peninsular India. The mountainous catchments of the Ghats are the primary contributors of flow in the rivers that sustains the life and agricultural productivity in the area. Although many studies have been conducted in the past decades to understand long term trends in the meteorological and hydrological variables of major river basins, not much attention have been made to unfold the relationship existing among rainfall and river hydrology of natural drainages on either side of the Western Ghats which host one of the unique biodiversity hotspots across the world. Therefore, an attempt has been made in this paper to examine the short term (last three decades) changes in the rainfall pattern and its influence on the hydrological characteristics of some of the important rivers draining the southern Western Ghats as a case study. The short term, annual and seasonal trends in the rainfall, and its variability and discharge were analyzed using Mann-Kendall test and estimator of slope. The study showed a decreasing trend in rainfall in the southwest monsoon while a reverse trend is noticed in northeast monsoon. Correspondingly, the discharge of the west and east flowing rivers also showed a declining trend in the southwest monsoon season. The runoff coefficient also followed the trends in the discharge. The runoff coefficient of the Periyar river showed a decreasing trend, whereas the Cauvery river exhibited an increasing trend. A high-resolution analysis of rainfall data revealed that the number of moderate rainfall events showed a decreasing trend throughout the southern Western Ghats, whereas the high intensity rainfall events showed an opposite trend. The decline in groundwater level in the areas which recorded an increase in high intensity rainfall events and decrease in moderate rainfall events showed that the groundwater recharge process is significantly affected by changes in the rainfall pattern of the area.\\'Abstract: \\'The present study has generated spatial databases on the vegetation type with plant biodiversity, forest fragmentation and disturbance regimes in Tamilnadu parts of Eastern Ghats (EG), India. These databases have been analysed geospatially with landscape ecology approach. The study also includes ground inventory of plant species based on Remote Sensing (RS) data stratification. The vegetation type map was generated from the visual interpretation of two season IRS LISS III data. The spatial landscape analysis of the remotely sensed interpreted images was carried out using customized software, SPLAM. This is first such study in Tamilnadu Eastern Ghats that provides a comprehensive spatial database on vegetation types, disturbance regime and plant species diversity. The study has shown that the dry deciduous and thorn forests have shown better resistance to disturbance compared to the most disturbed evergreen and semievergreen forests. The study outputs are being utilized by forest department and biodiversity boards for conservation action planning and compliance to Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).\\'India\\'Abstract: \\'Kodagu district produces 2% of the coffee, in complex, multistoried agroforestry systems. The forests of the district harbour a large population of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). The combined effects of high elephant density and major landscape changes due to the expansion of coffee cultivation are the cause of conflicts (HEC). Mitigation strategies, including electric fences and compensation schemes implemented by the Forest Department have met with limited success. Building on previous studies in the area, we assessed current spatial and temporal trends of conflict, analysed local perceptions and identified factors driving elephants into the estates. Our study, initiated in May 2007, shows that the intensity of HEC has increased over the last exhibiting new seasonal patterns. Conflict maps and the lack of correlation between physical features of the coffee plantations and elephant visits suggest elephants move along corridors between the eastern and western forests of the district, opportunistically foraging when crossing the plantations. Dung analyses indicate elephants have selectively included ripe coffee berries in their diet. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of wild elephants feeding on coffee berries. If this new behaviour spreads through the population, it will compound an already severe conflict situation. The behavioural plasticity, the multiplicity of stakeholders involved, the difficulty in defining the problem and the limits of technical solutions already proposed suggest that HEC in Kodagu has the ingredients of a problem whose resolution will require more shared understanding and problem solving work amongst the stakeholders.\\'Abstract: \\'Kodagu district produces 2% of the coffee, in complex, multistoried agroforestry systems.

The anthropogenic activities such as power generation (burning of fossil fuels), agriculture (livestock, farming, rice cultivation and burning of crop residues), polluting water bodies, and industry and urban activities (transport, mismanagement of solid, liquid waste, etc.) have risen substantially CO2 concentrations to 72% among GHGs. Emissions and sequestration of carbon need to be in balance to sustain ecosystem functions and maintain the environmental conditions. Forests are the major carbon sinks to mitigate global warming. The current research focusses on the carbon budgeting through quantification of emissions and sinks in the Uttara Kannada district, central Western Ghats, Karnataka. This would help in evolving appropriate mitigation strategies towards sustainable management of forests. The study reveals that total carbon stored in vegetation and soils are and respectively. The annual carbon increment in forests is about Carbon uptake by the natural forest is about and by the forest plantations is amounting to the total of Sector-wise carbon emissions are (livestock), (paddy cultivation), (fuel wood consumption), and (vehicular transport), respectively. The analysis highlights that forest ecosystems in Uttara Kannada are playing a significant role in the mitigation of regional as well as global carbon emissions. Hence, the premium should be on conservation of the remaining native forests, which are vital for the water security (perennial streams) and food security (sustenance of biodiversity) and mitigation of global warming through carbon sequestration. Sustainable management ecosystem practices involving local stakeholders will further enhance the ability of forests to sequester atmospheric carbon apart from other ecosystem services, such as hydrological services and improvements in soil and water quality.\\'India\\'Abstract: \\'Climate change affects local and regional water resources. Especially in regions with water scarcity, high climate sensitivity, and dynamic socioeconomic development, an adaptation of water management strategies is needed. Our study aims at (i) testing a new downscaling approach to utilize climate model results in a meso-scale hydrologic model and at (ii) analyzing the impact of climate change on the water balance components in the Mula and Mutha Rivers catchment upstream of the city of Pune, India. The new downscaling approach relies on the inherent consistency of both, the climate model and the measured data. It allows to derive a representation of a future climate scenario by rearranging past measurements We found a good agreement of the monthly statistics of the rearranged and the original measured data in the baseline period. However, the downscaling method is limited by the range of measured values provided in the baseline period, which results in an underestimation of temperatures in the last of the scenario period. The downscaled weather data for IPCC emission scenario A1B were used in a hydrologic impact assessment with SWAT. The scenario resulted in higher evapotranspiration, particularly in the first months of the dry season and in repeated low water storages in the reservoirs at the end of rainy season. Consequently, local and downstream water users as well as rain-fed agriculture and semi-natural vegetation in the Western Ghats increasingly suffer from water stress.\\'Abstract: \\'The diet and feeding ecology of 12 cyprinid fishes were studied in the Thalayanai stream of southern India. The diet of Barbodes sarana, Danio aequipinnatus and Rasbora daniconius were specialized in terrestrial and aquatic insects. Hypselobarbus dobsoni and Garra mullya consumed vegetative matter and unicellular algae as their most important dietary component, respectively. Hypselobarbus curmuca and Hypselobarbus dubius specialized in crustaceans and molluscs. Puntius amphibious, Puntius bimaculatus, Puntius dorsalis, Puntius filamentosus and Puntius tambraparniei fed on variety of food resources (aquatic insects, algae and detritus) and their feeding intake varied between wet to dry seasons. index of diet breadth showed the broadest diets for P. dorsalis in both seasons, whereas G. mullya had a narrow feeding spectrum in both seasons. Among co-existing species, diet overlaps were substantially low during both wet and dry season. These results suggest that feeding specialization and low diet overlap reduce inter-specific competition, allowing co-existence of these cyprinid fishes in this highly structured stream assemblage.\\'Abstract: \\'Studies on the occurrence of aquatic hyphomycetes were carried out in Panekal sulfur spring in the Western Ghats, India by incubation of leaf litter and analysis of natural foam and of induced foam. Sampling was done once every three months over a period of two years from September 1989 to June 1991. The temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and sulfide content of water were also measured. No fungi were observed within the spring, whereas 16 species belonging to 13 genera were isolated from two outflow sites of the stream. The percent frequency of Triscelophorus monosporus was high (24.0%). The temperature of water in the spring ranged between 30.0 and and the sulfide content between 3.2 and 4.3 mg Studies showed that sulfide water (4.0 mg from the spring inhibited the growth of the colonies of Dactylella aquatica, Phalangispora constricta, Tetracladium setigerum, Vermispora cauveriana, and Wiesneriomyces laurinus. When the leaves colonized by aquatic hyphomycetes were incubated at different temperatures in sulfur-spring water and stream water separately, sporulation was not observed in any of the fungi at and above except Phalangispora constricta, which could sporulate at At lower temperatures relatively fewer species were found to sporulate in sulfur-spring water than in stream water.\\'Abstract: \\'We mapped filamentous fungal association with mechanically and woody litter naturally deposited in a stream of the Western Ghats of India. Using a durometer (rubber hardness tester), the toughness of surface of wood collected from stream was determined by considering durometer reading from to as hardwood and softwood, respectively. From each wood diameter), two segments each of length were excised and vertically cut into nine sections comprising eight marginal and one central section. From three stream locations, hardwood and softwood sections were assessed for the occurrence of lignicolous and Ingoldian fungi. A first set of wood sections was incubated in damp chambers up to with periodical screening (every for lignicolous fungi. Another set was incubated in bubble chambers up to to ascertain colonization of Ingoldian fungi. In hardwood sections, 17 lignicolous fungi (ascomycetes, four; mitosporic fungi, 13; mean, 6.8; range, and ten Ingoldian fungi (mean, 2; range, comprising nine lignicolous and three Ingoldian fungi as core-group taxa were recovered. In softwood, ten lignicolous fungi (ascomycetes, 0; mitosporic fungi, ten; mean, 3.8; range, and 26 Ingoldian fungi (mean, 8.1; range, comprising six lignicolous and 12 Ingoldian fungi as core-group taxa were recovered. The ratio of lignicolous fungi/Ingoldian fungi was higher in hardwood than softwood (1.7 vs. 0.4). The spore output of Ingoldian fungi was higher in softwood (mean, range, than hardwood (mean, range, The Shannon diversity of lignicolous fungi was higher in hardwood than softwood (3.604 vs. 2.665), whereas it was opposite for Ingoldian fungi (3.116 vs. 3.918). The overall fungal diversity was higher in softwood than hardwood (4.413 vs. 4.219). The range of index of similarity among wood sections was higher in lignicolous fungi and than Ingoldian fungi and in hardwood and softwood. The rarefaction indices of expected number of taxa against hardwood sections revealed higher and persistent lignicolous fungi than the Ingoldian fungi, while the Ingoldian fungi were persistent in softwood sections, although they were lower than lignicolous fungi. Our study demonstrated the dominance of lignicolous fungi and Ingoldian fungi in hardwood and softwood, respectively.\\'Abstract: \\'The bacterial community structure of the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil of Pinus patula, found in the Nilgiris region of Western Ghats, was studied by constructing 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. In the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil clone libraries constructed, 13 and 15 bacterial phyla were identified, respectively. The clone libraries showed the predominance of members of culturally underrepresented phyla like Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. The Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria clones were predominant in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil samples, respectively. In rhizosphere, amongst Alphaproteobacteria members, Bradyrhizobium formed the significant proportion, whereas in non-rhizosphere, members of subdivision-6 of phylum Acidobacteria were abundant. The diversity analysis of P. patula soil libraries showed that the phylotypes (16S rRNA gene similarity cutoff, of Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes were relatively predominant and diverse followed by Alphaproteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. The diversity indices estimated higher richness and abundance of bacteria in P. patula soil clone libraries than the pine forest clone libraries retrieved from previous studies. The tools like principal co-ordinate analysis and Jackknife cluster analysis, which were under UniFrac analysis indicated that variations in soil bacterial communities were attributed to their respective geographical locations due to the phylogenetic divergence amongst the clone libraries. Overall, the P. patula rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere clone libraries were found significantly unique in composition, evenly distributed and highly rich in phylotypes, amongst the biogeographically distant clone libraries. It was finally hypothesised that the phylogenetic divergence amongst the bacterial phylotypes and natural selection plays a pivotal role in the variations of bacterial communities across the geographical distance.\\'Abstract: \\'We assessed the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and dark septate endophyte (DSE) fungal associations in 57 ferns and 3 lycophytes (belonging to 15 families in 39 genera) of different life forms (epiphytic, saxicolous and terricolous) occurring in Palni Hills of Western Ghats. Fungal symbiosis was absent in all the three lycophytes examined. Fifty-five of the 57 ferns examined had AM and 37 had DSE fungal association. This is the first report on AM and DSE fungal association for 22 and 30 species, respectively. In addition, AM morphology was evaluated for the first time in 34 species. Sixty-five percentage of the mycorrhizal ferns had intermediate-type AM and had typical Paris-type AM morphology. Both Paris- and intermediate-type AM morphologies were observed in of ferns. The root length colonized by AM and DSE fungal structures significantly varied among species, and a significant negative relation existed between the root length colonized by AM and DSE fungi.\\'Abstract: \\'The selected study area is a coastal watershed which receives high rainfall in the monsoon season. During this period, most of the water input to the watershed drains to the Arabian Sea without any adequate use due to the rugged topography of the watershed. Hence, an attempt has been made to assess the physical properties specifically morphometric parameters of the Gad watershed using geoinformatics techniques along with field evidence for understanding the relationship between fluvial landforms and hydro-physical parameters in the region. Morphometric parameters have been analyzed and integrated with physical parameters like topography, rainfall, soil, land cover, geology, and geomorphology for evaluating the potential water resource availability in the Gad watershed. The results of the study have shown that there is high surface water availability in the watershed with very low water retaining capacity, mainly in the upper region of the watershed due to presence of basaltic bedrock and steep slopes. Based on this work, a water resource management plan has been suggested at a subwatershed level which established on the physical properties and morphological characteristics of the study area.\\'Abstract: \\'Understanding the patterns of biodiversity is central to species conservation planning. Here we illustrate chiropteran diversity and distribution pattern of the hill ranges of the Eastern Ghats of Odisha state, India using roost survey and mist net survey techniques. The present study recorded 23 bat species including two newly recorded species for the study site i.e., Hipposideros galeritus and Megaderma spasma. The bat capture rate was the highest in the moist deciduous forest describing higher bat populations compared with the places of human habitation. Utilities of 21 climate, three physiographic and two disturbance variables and species distribution modelling could reveal that the north-eastern part was more suitable for bat distributions than the southern part of the region. The climate, physiographic and disturbance variables were crucial in their distributions, where elevation and potential evapotranspiration were highly significant. Unlike other species, Taphozous melanopogon showed negative correlation with these variables. The mean diurnal temperature and precipitation seasonality have positive influence on bat distributions, indicating their resilience to seasonal precipitation changes and day time temperature fluctuations. The negative effect of temperature seasonality on the distribution of Pteropus giganteus could attribute to its vulnerability to climate change effects. The study provides inputs for monitoring the future spatio-temporal changes, suggesting long term conservation measures. It could generate basic information on the impacts of climate change on bat distribution in the future climate change scenario.\\'Abstract: \\'The primary deciduous forests in the Eastern Ghats (EG) of Tamil Nadu (TN) India have undergone many changes owing to various need-based forest managements, such as timber extraction for industry, railway sleepers, charcoal, and forest clearance for hydroelectric projects and agriculture, during preindependence and postindependence periods (i.e., from 1800 to 1980). The enactment of a forest conservation act during the 1980s changed the perception of forest managers from utilization to conservation. This study was taken up to assess the forests dynamics in the EG of TN spatially between 1990 and 2003 and nonspatially between 1900 and the 1980s. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Indian Remote Sensing satellite (IRS) 1D Linear Imaging and Self Scanning (LISS III) data were used to assess forests during 1990 and 2003, respectively. Field floristic survey and secondary data (such as published literature, floras, books, and forest working plans) were used to assess the forest dynamics in terms of forest type and species composition among the preindependence period, the postindependence period, and the present (i.e., before and after 1980). The satellite data analysis revealed a considerable amount of changes in all forest types during the The comparison of species composition and forest types between the past and present revealed that need-based forest management along with anthropogenic activity have altered the primary deciduous forest in to secondary and postextraction secondary forests such as southern thorn and southern thorn scrub forests in the middle above mean sea level (MSL)] and lower slopes MSL). However, the evergreen forests present at the upper slope MSL) and plateau seemed not to be much affected by the forest management. The changes estimated by the satellite data processing in the major forest types such as evergreen, deciduous, southern thorn, and southern thorn scrub are really alarming because these changes have occurred after the implementation of a forest conservation act. The dependence of local people on forests for various purposes in this region is also considerably high, which might be a key factor for the changes in the forests. The results of this study not only provide an outlook on the present status of the forests and the change trends but also provide the basis for further studies on forests in the EG of TN.\\'Abstract: \\'At present the biodiversity in Eastern Ghats is threatened by loss of habitats, exploitation and unscientific management of natural resources, forest fire, biological invasion and other anthropogenic pressures. In this context, we have assessed the forest cover changes, fragmentation and disturbance in the R.V.

Satellite data of IRS-1A LISS II of 1988 and IRS-P6 LISS III of 2006 were assessed for forest cover changes in 1 sq.km grid and generated as Sensitivity Index map. Further the road and settlement buffer of was generated to represent Threat Index map. From 1988 to 2006, the forest cover had a total cover loss of 35.2 sq.km and increase in scrub cover by 7.2%. Over all change analysis from 1988 to 2006 with reference to forest cover indicates, negative changes (loss of forest area) accounted for 48.1 sq.km area and positive changes (gain of forest) necessitates the conservation measures in this range with high priority.\\'Abstract: \\'Floral composition and structural parameters of the herbaceous vegetation of four recovering tropical dry deciduous forest stands protected for 2, 4, 6 and 10-year periods, on the Eastern Ghats of India, situated at Kandhamal district of Orissa, India were investigated. More than of recovering forest stands of each of the four stages was selected and fifteen sample quadrats of were randomly placed at each stand for vegetation analysis. Floristic analysis revealed highest number of species (69) in 2-year recovering stand, which declined with increase in age. A total of 87 species, 71 genera and 32 families were recorded in the forest stands. Total number of herbaceous species encountered in the stands was 44, 28, 30 and 24 in 2, 4, 6 and 10-year stands, respectively. Total individuals of all herb species were 114, 70, 88 and in 2, 4, 6 and 10-year stands, respectively. Herbaceous stand basal areas were 7.84, 3.66, 4.77 and in 2, 4, 6, and 10-year stands, respectively. Importance value index (IVI) revealed that Heteropogon contortus was predominant in 2 and 4-year stands, Andrographis paniculatus in 6-year stand and Elephantopus scaber in 10-year stand. Diversity-dominance curve revealed lognormal distribution in all the four stands. dominance index (C) was highest in 2-year stand which decreased in other stands, while diversity index (H1) was almost the same in all the stands. Biomass of herbaceous vegetation was in in in and in 10-year stand.\\'Abstract: \\'Botanical exploration in Ananthagiri hill range revealed the endemic species Cyathea nilgirensis Holttum (Cyatheaceae).

For understanding the role of agroforestry on biodiversity, a study was undertaken to access butterfly diversity in coffee, cashew and guava plantations in Eastern Ghats of southern Odisha during 2016. A total of 1075 individuals of butterflies belonging to 60 species and 46 genera under five families were recorded during the study. Species richness (S) as well as Shannon diversity (H) were found to be higher in coffee plantation, followed by cashew and guava However, though butterfly abundance was found to be maximum in coffee (43%), it was higher in guava (33%) followed by cashew (24%). Also, a significant difference was observed between butterfly abundance among three plantations. This shows coffee plantation was the best habitat for butterflies among the three agroforestry habitats studied. The reason for this was habitat heterogeneity in coffee plantation supporting maximum exclusive butterfly species and was least-human influenced with close canopy forest. Over all, family Nymphalidae was found to be the most abundant, and Lycaenidae was the least abundant. The findings of the present study are promising and may set new directions for management of agroforestry plantations in the region to support a rich biodiversity.\\'Abstract: \\'In tropical evergreen forest in the Kolli Hills of the Indian Eastern Ghats, four 2 ha (100 m 200 m) replicate plots (two plots each in undisturbed and human-impacted sites), were inventoried for species diversity of lianas cm girth at breast height (g.b.h.) and their relationships with cm g.b.h. host trees. Liana diversity included 26 species from 18 families and 24 genera. The population density and basal area of lianas in the study plots were 48 individuals and 0.23 m2 respectively, while those of the trees were 478 stems and 43.6 m2 respectively. As the lianas and their hosts had often been cut in the disturbed sites, their diversity was less there than in the undisturbed sites. Five (19%) liana species were common to all four sites. Three lianas, Hiptage benghalensis (Malpighiaceae), Elaeagnus indica (Elaeagnaceae) and Gnetum ula (Gnetaceae) were dominant. The twining mechanism (54% of liana species and 71% of individuals) and zoochorous diaspores (73% of species and 77% of individuals) predominated. A total of 336 trees from 39 species, 34 genera and 22 families hosted 345 lianas. The ratio of liana : host for species was 1 : 1.5 and for individuals was 1 : 1. Liana preferences for certain host trees, host girth classes and trellis heights were evident.\\'Abstract: \\'Live fencing, an age old and traditional agroforestry practice, remains relatively less understood and least documented at least in India. Exploratory surveys conducted in the northern part of the Eastern ghat region of India covering five districts of three states (Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Chhatisgarh), indicated that traditional farmers have vast knowledge about their live fencing practices and the species used. Two groups of species were observed on the fence. The first group of thirty three species were used primarily for protection and denoted as fence species. Together, they also provide 22 other products and services. The second group of species maintained on the fences for production purposes include five fruit trees, fifteen other trees and two climbers. The fencing practices were classified into two groups (single species and multiple species live fence systems) depending on the species used and into three groups (live fencing around field crops, around backyards or homesteads and around orchards/plantations) depending on the landscapes being protected. Only 20% of fences were dominated by single species; the rest were under multiple species.Ninety percent of house backyards were fenced, whereas only one percent of crop fields and seventy percent orchards were fenced. Some promising fence species of this region are Acacia caesia, A concinna, A. nilotica, Agave sisalana, Annona squamosa, Borassus flabellifer, Carissa carandus, Lawsonia inermis and Murraya koenigii\\'Abstract: \\'Landscape ecology as a discipline in science is rather young. However its principles appear promising in outlining conservation strategies including a wide range of organisms, particularly birds. Birds due to their mobility use a variety of environmental resources, especially habitats. However, currently these habitats are only available in patches over most of the tropical world. Further whatever is left is under constant human pressure. This paper, therefore, addresses this problem and suggests means of dealing with it using the landscape approach as outlined by landscape ecology.\\'Abstract: \\' Santalum album L. is an economically important tropical tree species. Owing to extensive logging, changes in land-use patterns and poor natural regeneration, the natural sandal populations are rapidly dwindling. It is feared that such threats could easily undermine the genetic diversity of sandal populations. Effective measures to prevent such loss are prerequisite. We have developed baseline data on the levels of genetic diversity and its distribution on a geographic scale for sandal in India. Based on Geographic Information System, distribution map of sandal was developed and found that the populations were geographically more concentrated in the Deccan plateau. It was found that, for past there was a monotonic decrease in the extraction of sandal in the state of Karnataka, India. Using allozyme markers, the genetic diversity of 19 sandal populations in peninsular India were determined and over all observed heterzygosity (Ho) was found to be 31%. The percent Ho was positively correlated with the density of the sandal populations and with increasing longitude it was found to be negatively correlated The dendrogram analysis indicated a clear clustering of sandal populations based on their geographic occurrence. The Deccan plateau populations were found to be genetically the most diverse and seemed to represent the of sandal genetic resources in peninsular India. Our results have important implications for the conservation strategies for sandal populations in peninsular India and can be applied for the conservation of other taxa as well.\\'Ghats, India\\'Abstract: \\'Environmental implications of Biological spectrum tree species diversity in two protected forests of Gandhamardan hill ranges of Eastern Ghats, India, are of great ecological significance in the perspective of climatic change. Biological spectrum includes phanerophytes nanophanerophytes chamaephytes hemicryptophytes geophytes hydrophytes therophytes and lianas The comparison with normal spectrum depicts The present study enlisted of a total of 10,775 trees belonging to 90 tree species within a sampled area (441 plots). The index is 3.92 (Site-I) and 3.31 (Site-II) with value 1.0. This value indicates that the tropical moist deciduous forests are also species diverse systems. Mean stand density was in Site-I and in Site-II. Ascertaining the phytoclimate of Gandhamardan hill ranges tree species diversity and comparing the area on a geographical scale would be helpful for conservation and management of the study area.\\'Abstract: \\'Data on the conservation status of 167 species of flowering plants presented here are from two representative sectors in south India: (a) the lowlands, characterized by dry deciduous vegetation representative of the Deccan plateau, as also a cluster of eight low altitude hill ranges [to 1200 (1500) m] of the southernmost reaches of the Eastern Ghats of India, and coastlands including mangroves; and (b) the hills, the high altitude hill ranges (to 2475 m) of the Palni hills, an eastward spur of the Western Ghats of India, characterized by evergreen vegetation but largely decimated around the hill station of Kodaikanal with the invasion of alien species since the l840s with the arrival of overseas colonial personnel and the raising of commercial monoculture plantations. Data for the 167 species are entered in 7 + 1 columns for the two regions separately. However, the IUCN red list categories are not used in their entirety for two reasons: (i) the areas are relatively small; (ii) the stress comes more from extrinsic causes like habitat destruction and over-exploitation rather than intrinsic (genetic) causes. However, it is stressed that what is happening over restricted areas over short time intervals is a miniature of what is happening over larger areas over longer periods, and hence these data are vitally important in planning for conservation and eco-restoration. The quality and quantity of new information are decisive; the findings are discussed under nine heads, as the first synthesis of results obtained from over two decades of field work.\\'Abstract: \\'Tropical forests, which play critical roles in global biogeochemical cycles, radiation budgets and biodiversity, have undergone rapid changes in land cover in the last few decades. This study examines the complex process of land cover change in the biodiversity hotspot of Western Ghats, India, specifically investigating the effects of conservation measures within the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary. Current vegetation patterns were mapped using an IRS P6 LISS III image and this was used together with Landsat MSS data from 1973 to map land cover transitions. Two major and divergent trends were observed. A dominant degradational trend can be attributed to agricultural expansion and infrastructure development while a successional trend, resulting from protection of the area, showed the resilience of the system after prolonged disturbances. The sanctuary appears susceptible to continuing disturbances under the current management regime but at lower rates than in surrounding unprotected areas. The study demonstrates that remotely sensed land cover assessments can have important contributions to monitoring land management strategies, understanding processes underpinning land use changes and helping to inform future conservation strategies.\\'Abstract: \\'Landscape ecology, inter alia, addresses the question as to how altered landscape patterns affect the distribution, persistence, and abundance of a species. Landscape ecology plays an important role in integrating the different scales of biodiversity from habitat patch to biome level. Satellite remote sensing technology with multi-sensor capabilities offers multi-scale information on landscape composition and configuration. Advances in geospatial analytical tools and spatial statistics have improved the capability to quantify spatial heterogeneity. Globally, landscape level characterization of biodiversity has become an important discipline of science. Considering the vast extent, heterogeneity, and ecological and economic importance of forest landscapes, significant efforts have been made in India during the past decade to strengthen landscape level biodiversity characterization. The generic frame work of studies comprises preparation of national databases providing information on composition and configuration of different landscapes using multi-scale remote sensing techniques, understanding the landscape patterns using geospatial models to elicit disturbance and diversity patterns and application of this information for bioprospecting and conservation purposes. Studies on hierarchical linkage of multi-scale information to study the processes of change, landscape function, dynamics of habitat fragmentation, invasion, development of network of conservation areas based on the understanding of multi-species responses to landscape mosaics, macro-ecological studies to understand environment and species richness, habitat and species transitions and losses, landscape level solutions to adaptation and mitigation strategies to climate change are a few of the future challenges. The paper presents the current experiences and, analyses in conjunction with international scenario and identifies future challenges of Indian landscape level biodiversity studies.\\'Hanuman langurs in Karnataka, India\\'Abstract: \\'We assessed the distribution and conservation status of bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata), rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and Hanuman langurs (Semnopithecus entellus) in the state of Karnataka, India. Karnataka is situated in southwest India with an area of A total of of vehicular survey was made from November 2001 to July 2004. We also visited 107 temples/tourist spots to determine the presence of primates. Bonnet macaques and Hanuman langurs were widely distributed, whereas rhesus macaques were not found in the state. However, bonnet macaques were absent in a few districts in the northern plains and Hanuman langurs were absent in some districts of the southern plains. A total of 205 groups of bonnet macaques and 139 groups of Hanuman langurs were sighted. The relative encounter rate of both species differed across biogeographic zones. Bonnet macaques were largely encountered in the Western Ghats and the Southern Plateau whereas Hanuman langurs were abundant in the Western Ghats and Northern Plains. We found that bonnet macaques have been eliminated from about 48% temples/tourist spots where they occurred in the recent past. The Hanuman langur population of Road was assessed during April 2003, and we found that the present population size was about 38% of a previous survey in 1961. Habitat change, hunting/trapping and translocation were the major factors causing a decline in the langur population.\\'Abstract: \\'Sacred groves are patches of forests preserved for their spiritual and religious significance. The practice gained relevance with the spread of agriculture that caused large-scale deforestation affecting biodiversity and watersheds. Sacred groves may lose their prominence nowadays, but are still relevant in Indian rural landscapes inhabited by traditional communities. The recent rise of interest in this tradition encouraged scientific study that despite its pan-Indian distribution, focused on northeast, Western Ghats and east coast either for their global/importance or unique ecosystems. Most studies focused on flora, mainly angiosperms, and the faunal studies concentrated on vertebrates while lower life forms were grossly neglected. Studies on ecosystem functioning are few although observations are available. Most studies attributed watershed protection values to sacred groves but hardly highlighted hydrological process or water yield in comparison with other land use types. The grove studies require diversification from a stereotyped path and must move towards creating credible scientific foundations for conservation. Documentation should continue in unexplored areas but more work is needed on basic ecological functions and ecosystem dynamics to strengthen planning for scientifically sound sacred grove management.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Director of environmental studies at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Human Ecology, Environmental and Population Studies at the University of Rajasthan. This paper describes the biodiversity in the north-western Indian State of Rajasthan, its relationship with the environment and the existing human and livestock populations. As the biodiversity is depleting in this area due to zoogenic and anthropogenic reasons, certain pragmatic conservation strategies are advocated. The north-western part of India is occupied by a desert ecosystem, the Thar Desert. Animal husbandry is the major livelihood in the region, followed by agriculture. The vegetation, which is predominantly xerophytic and quite sparse, occurs in great variety. Six hundred and eighty-two plant species and 390 animal species have been identified from the Thar Desert. Many plant and animal species have become endangered due to zoogenic and anthropogenic activities. Plants such as Calligonum polygonoides, Tecomella undulata and Prosopis cineraria urgently require conservation.\\'Abstract: \\'Freshwater fish comprise one of the most threatened vertebrate groups with close to one-third of the species in danger of extinction (Dudgeon 2012) and several species already extinct (Baillie and Butcher 2012). This vulnerability has been largely attributed among others, to the poor state of knowledge (Dudgeon 2003, 2012; Cooke et al. 2012), and the uneven distribution of conservation attention and investment (Darwall et al. 2011a) on freshwater ecosystems and their resources.\\'Abstract: \\'Vegetation structure and species composition of tropical ecosystems were studied through nine transects at Veerapuli and Kalamalai reserve forests in the Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India. Species diversity, dominance, species richness and evenness indices of plant communities and also population structure of woody plants were enumerated. A total of 244 species (183 genera and 76 families) were recorded. Species richness (number of species) were 82,142 and 96 species per 0.3 ha respectively for the study areas of low-elevation forest (LEF), mid-elevation forest (MEF) and high elevation forest (HEF). Species diversity indices were greater in MEF compared to the other two forests except juveniles. In contrast, greater dominance value indices were recorded in LEF than other forests. Density and basal area of the MEF were twice greater than the LEF, while HEF showed greater tree density and low basal area when compared to LEF. The stem density and species richness (number of species) decreased with increased size classes of trees observed in the present study indicated good regeneration status. Population structure of juveniles and seedlings also reflects good regeneration status. Terminalia paniculata (IVI of 99.9) and Hopea parviflora (IVI of 103.8) were dominant tree species respectively in LEF and MEF whereas in HEF Agrostistachys meeboldii (63.65), Cullenia excelsa (63.67) and Drypetes oblongifolia (39.67) share the dominance. Past damage (anthropogenic perturbation) may be one of the reasons for single species dominance in LEF and MEF. Occurrence of alien species such as Eupatorium odoratum and Ageratum conyzoides also indicated the past disturbance in LEF. The variations in plant diversity and population structure are largely due to anthropogenic perturbation and other abiotic factors.\\'Abstract: \\'A total of 373 species of wild relatives of crop plants representing 120 genera and 48 families were collected from different phytogeographical regions of India during a mission mode sub-project on Sustainable Management of Plant Biodiversity under National Agricultural Technology Project during Significant diversity representing endemic/rare/endangered species has been discussed in this paper. The information on phytogeographical distribution, life form, economic types and assessment of threat has also been included. Thrust areas for future target collections and conservation have been discussed to serve as reference for management of genetic resources.\\'Abstract: \\'Slender lorises live in forests of southern India and Sri Lanka. Little is known about their distribution patterns and relative densities. We report the results of a survey conducted in 6 forest divisions in the southern parts of the state of Andhra Pradesh, South India.

We recommend conservation measures for Loris tardigradus.\\'Abstract: \\'Tropical forests are the largest terrestrial storehouses of carbon and are recognized as rich, diverse and highly productive ecosystems. The present study was conducted to characterize the land use, diversity and biomass of tropical forest in Western Ghat of Maharashtra State in India through satellite remote sensing and GIS. The study has been designed and implemented to promote analysis on Western Ghat biodiversity resources including trees, shrubs and herbs based on inventorying, monitoring and mapping. Field measured biomass is integrated with spectral responses of various bands and indices of the Landsat TM satellite image for estimation of above-ground biomass in a area of relic forest in the Central Western Ghat. The above-ground biomass from field-based inventory varied from 30.2 to in moist deciduous forest, in dry deciduous forest, in semi-evergreen forest, and in evergreen forest. The total above-ground biomass of the study area was estimated to be tons. A regression equation between field above-ground biomass and a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was used for spectral modeling to estimate and prepare the above-ground biomass map in the region. A total 120 plant species in 81 genera and 31 families were identified in the study area. This study emphasizes the importance of relic forests for their biodiversity, carbon sequestration and total biomass.\\'RAPD and microsatellite markers\\'Abstract: \\'Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and microsatellite markers were applied to evaluate the genetic variation in endemic and endangered yellow catfish, Horabagrus brachysoma sampled from three geographic locations of Western Ghat, South India river systems. In RAPD, of 32 10-mer RAPD primers screened initially, 10 were chosen and used in a comparative analysis of H. brachysoma collected from Meenachil, Chalakkudy and Nethravathi River systems. Of the 124 total RAPD fragments amplified, 49 (39.51%) were found to be shared by individuals of all 3 populations. The remaining 75 fragments were found to be polymorphic (60.48%). In microsatellites, six polymorphic microsatellite loci were identified by using primers developed for Pangasius hypophthalmus, Clarias macrocephalus and Clarias gariepinus. The identified loci were confirmed as microsatellite by sequencing after making a clone. The nucleotide sequences of 6 loci were published in NCBI genbank. The number of alleles across the six loci ranged from 4 to 7 and heterozygosities ranged from 0.07 to 0.93. The mean number of alleles and effective number of alleles per locus were 5.00 and 3.314, respectively. The average heterozygosity across all investigated samples was 0.72, indicating a significant deficiency of heterozygotes in this species. RAPD and microsatellite methods reported a high degree of gene diversity and genetic distances depicted by UPGMA dendrograms among the populations of H. brachysoma.\\'Abstract: \\'The genus Isoetes L. in India is represented by 14species, of which eight species are recognized as being local endemics [confinedto one particular phyto-geographical division (PGD)] while the remaining sixoccur in more than one PGD and are described as endemic to a wider range. Thelocal endemic species are Isoetes dixitei,Isoetes panchganiensis and Isoetessahyadriensis in Western Ghats region; Isoetespantii, Isoetes bilaspurensis, Isoetesreticulata and Isoetes tuberculata inChotanagpur Malwa Vindhya Plateau and Isoetes debii innortheastern India. The wider endemic species are Isoetespanchananii, Isoetes sampathkumaranii,Isoetes rajasthanensis, Isoetesmahadevensis, Isoetes indica andIsoetes coromandelina. Our studies on the patterns ofendemism suggest that the radiation of quillworts advanced from dry lowlandareas to the rainy uplands and mountains. Isoetescoromandelina is the first Indian quillwort to colonize in lowlandsof the coastal zone (Coromandel), from where it spread to different parts of thesub-continent and gave rise to new species. Thus this species is a key Indianspecies which has played an important role in the radiation of quillwort in thecountry and appeared as the connecting link among the quillwort flora of variousPGDs. The centres of diversity for almost all the presently known Indianquillworts species are recognized.\\'Abstract: \\'Diversity in morphological characters of 206 accessions of 14 wild Vigna species from India was assessed. Of these, 12 species belonged to Asian Vigna in the subgenus Ceratotropis and two were V. vexillata and V. pilosa belonging to subgenus Plectotropis and Dolichovigna, respectively. Data on 71 morphological traits, both qualitative and quantitative, were recorded. Data on 45 qualitative and quantitative traits exhibiting higher variation were subjected to multivariate analysis for establishing species relationships and assessing the pattern of intraspecific variation. Of the three easily distinguishable groups in the subgenus Ceratotropis, all the species in mungo-radiata group, except V. khandalensis, viz. V. radiata var. sublobata, V. radiata var. setulosa, V. mungo var. silvestris and V. hainiana showed greater homology in vegetative morphology and growth habit. The species, however, differed in other plant, flower, pod and seed characteristics. Within species variation was higher in V. mungo var. silvestris populations and three distinct clusters could be identified in multivariate analysis. V. umbellata showed more similarity to V. dalzelliana than V. bourneae and V. minima in the angularis-umbellata (azuki bean) group. Within species variations was higher in V. umbellata than other species in the group. In the aconitifolia-trilobata (mothbean), V. trilobata populations, were more diverse than V. aconitifolia. The cultigens of the conspecific wild species were more robust in growth, with large vegetative parts and often of erect growth with three- to five-fold increase in seed size and seed weight, except V. aconitifolia, which has still retained the wild type morphology to a greater extent. More intensive collection, characterisation and conservation of species diversity and intraspecific variations, particularly of the close wild relatives of Asian Vigna with valuable characters such as resistance to biotic/abiotic stresses, more number of pod bearing clusters per plant etc. assumes great priority in crop improvement programmes.\\'Abstract: \\'An ecosystem approach is the only way to conserve habitats and the enormous number of species. The related area-based Aichi biodiversity target of the convention on biological diversity aims to conserve at least 17% of terrestrial environment by 2020. This is the first regional study to recognize a network of key habitats to achieve conservation goals. It is essential to have a spatial framework by creating the indicator using existing remote sensing-based data. In this work, conservation principles were integrated at the ecosystem level covering irreplaceability and vulnerability along with representativeness. Forest persistence, ecosystem rarity, forest intactness, landscape-level ecosystem, biomass carbon stocks, and biological richness were among the biological criteria used to analyze ecosystem irreplaceability. The proxies used for ecosystem vulnerability are high fragmentation, fire hotspots and proximity to disturbance factors. A unique value is assigned to each individual pixel in the prioritization map. Overall representation of habitat coverage in protected area network of South Asian countries indicates under-representation of several forest types with less than 17% coverage. The overlay of the priority areas proposes that there is a possibility of conserving many species with the notification of protected areas. This study demonstrates the conservation priorities by identifying key habitats based on multiple conservation principles.\\'Abstract: \\'The forestry sector is being increasingly considered for abatement of greenhouse gases.

Such occurrences result from the independent recognitions of specimens by several botanists in particular places and at particular occasions. Thereby, the analysis of the resulting occasional involves the assignment of the species occurrences to spatial units such as a grid of quadrats. As a result, the distribution of occurrences among quadrats is controlled while their distribution among species is observed. In this paper we show how non-symmetric correspondence analysis (NSCA) enables the investigation of data structure by taking into account this fundamental asymmetry. We apply this new ordination technique to a list of endemic tree species occurrences in the Western Ghats (South India). We explore the interesting properties of NSCA as an ordination technique and demonstrate the usefulness of the method as a tool in biogeography. Regarding the Western Ghats, NSCA brings out the preponderance of deforestation over biogeographic history in explaining the observed multispecific patterns.\\'Abstract: \\'Culturally protected forest patches or sacred groves have been the integral part of many traditional societies. This age old tradition is a classic instance of community driven nature conservation sheltering native biodiversity and supporting various ecosystem functions particularly hydrology. The current work in Central Western Ghats of Karnataka, India, highlights that even small sacred groves amidst humanised landscapes serve as tiny islands of biodiversity, especially of rare and endemic species. Temporal analysis of landuse dynamics reveals the changing pattern of the studied landscape. There is fast reduction of forest cover in last to meet up the demand of agricultural land and plantation programs. A thorough survey and assessment of woody endemic species distribution in the study area documented presence of 19 endemic species. The distribution of these species is highly skewed towards the culturally protected patches in comparison to other land use elements. It is found that, among the 19 woody endemic species, those with greater ecological amplitude are widely distributed in the studied landscape in groves as well as other land use forms whereas, natural population of the sensitive endemics are very much restricted in the sacred grove fragments. The recent degradation in the sacred grove system is perhaps, due to weakening of traditional belief systems and associated laxity in grove protection leading to biotic disturbances. Revitalisation of traditional practices related to conservation of sacred groves can go a long way in strengthening natural ecological systems of fragile humid tropical landscape.\\'Abstract: \\'This paper examines the status and characteristics of agrobiodiversity present in Kerala State, India, which is a part of the Western Lanka biodiversity hotspot. They show much heterogeneity. The State grows 142 crop plants belonging to 104 genera and 43 families. Almost the entire agrobiodiversity conservation work is being carried out by the central government, even though the states are also mandated to do this work. This appears to have an adverse effect on agrobiodiversity conservation. Until now, most attention was being paid to only the most important food and commercial crops, and very limited to their wild relatives and the less important crop plants.\\'Abstract: \\'Soil erosion induces land degradation and minimizes the water-holding capacity, resulting in poor environmental quality at a basin scale. This becomes more serious due to long-term anthropogenic pressure including over exploitation of natural resources and lack of sustainable development. In this study, an automated RUSLE-SY model was developed to identify the potential soil erosion and sediment yield zones in Tamiraparani sub-basin, South India. The input parameters required to execute the RUSLE-SY model are digital elevation model, study area boundary, land-use/land-cover data, soil data, annual rainfall data, near-infrared and red bands from satellite imagery. The entire set of data was geoprocessed with standard RUSLE and sediment yield equations for generating soil erosion and sediment yield map. The distribution of soil erosion and sediment yield in the study area was analyzed, and its impacts were discussed. The result reveals that the high soil erosion is noticed in the western part of the sub-basin Moreover, the sediment yield in this area contributes around The low level of soil erosion and sediment yield of the area) reflects the climatic variability and topography of Tamiraparani sub-basin. The resulting RUSLE-SY model provides a robust and easy to use soil erosion and conservation management tool for efficient planning in similar environments.\\'Abstract: \\'Pill-millipedes of the genus Arthrosphaera (Sphaerotheriidae) has restricted geographic distribution (Southern India, Sri Lanka and Madagascar) were under studied category of soil macrofauna. In the current study, seven morphospecies of Arthrosphaera were recovered in four biomes of the Western Ghats and west coast of India. In locations Makutta (A. fumosa), Karike (A. fumosa), Ninthikal (A. dalyi), Uppinangadi (A. magna) and Uppala (A. hendersoni) were endowed with only one species of Arthrosphaera. Although some locations consist of more than one species, one of them was dominated. Shankaraghatta forest consists of A. disticta and A. versicolor, but A. disticta was highly dominant. In Adyanadka plantations, A. magna was dominant than A. carinata. The highest number of A. disticta was recorded per quadrate in high-altitude location (Shimoga), followed by A. hendersoni in the coastal location (Uppala), A. magna (Adyanadka) and A. dalyi (Ninthikal) in foothill locations. The highest biomass of A. dalyi per quadrate was seen in Ninthikal, followed by A. magna in Adyanadka, A. disticta in Shimoga, A. fumosa in Karike and A. magna in Adyanadka and Uppinangadi. The richness of Arthrosphaera was positively correlated with biomass, conductivity, total nitrogen, potassium contents in soil and negatively correlated with calcium content in soil.\\'Abstract: \\'Shield tails are a group of snakes belonging to the family Uropeltidae, endemic to the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka.

These aquatic resources possess enormous potential to contribute towards the economic well-being of the nation, besides contributing to genetic improvement of farmed aquatic species. However, in spite of the important role that the biodiversity plays in our lives, all species that together comprise biodiversity have been facing huge risks, especially due to a number of anthropogenic factors. In the present paper an attempt has been made to review the approaches, modern genetic tools and modus operandi which are relevant to the management of the resources and to outline the future opportunities in research efforts for sustainable fish production to address the food concerns of the country.\\'Abstract: \\'Gray slender lorises (Loris lydekkerianus) are 1 of 2 nocturnal primate genera occurring in India. Although the distribution and abundance of the species is known for some parts of southern India, the relative distribution of the 2 subspecies, Loris lydekkerianus lydekkerianus and L. l. malabaricus, and their comparative densities and extent of overlap between their distributions remains largely unknown. We investigated the distribution pattern and relative density of slender lorises in the Western Ghats mountain range in the state of Kerala in southern India. We surveyed 36 forest ranges in 17 forest divisions of northern and central Kerala from February to November 2009 for the presence of lorises. We sighted slender lorises in 22 forest ranges in a variety of vegetation types, and the relative abundance of the species ranged from 0.02 to 1.44 lorises/km. Our results confirm that both loris subspecies are present in Kerala: Mysore slender lorises have a narrow patchy distribution on the eastern edges of the Western Ghats mountain range, and Malabar slender lorises have a fairly contiguous distribution on the western slopes of the Western Ghats. We recommend more detailed surveys in southern Kerala to identify the distribution patterns of the subspecies in these areas.\\'Abstract: \"The Gavlis are a pastoral caste of the forested hill tracts of India \\'s Western Ghats region. This paper examines their shift under British colonial rule from buffalo-keepers to goatherds to cultivators of increasingly marginal hill tracts, the context of forest exploitation and malaria control as well as more recent dairy development programs of the Indian government. It concludes that if present trends continue Gavlis everywhere will follow the same progression, eventually becoming landless migrants.\"Abstract: \\'Impact of anthropogenic disturbance on species diversity and vegetation structure of a lowland tropical rainforest was studied in the foothills of Eastern Himalaya, India. Tree species richness, density, basal area and the diversity indices were found significantly (P<0.05) decreased with the increasing level of disturbances whereas, shrub density, basal area and herb density significantly increased with increasing disturbance level. In case of shrubs, dominance index significantly (P<0.007) increased along the disturbance gradient, whereas evenness index significantly (P<0.005) decreased with an increasing level of disturbance. Shannon-Weiner diversity index for herbs significantly (P<0.016) increased with increasing disturbance whereas, dominance index was significantly (P<0.013) declined along the disturbance gradient. Results revealed that cm dbh classes constituted the highest stem density, and highest basal area was recorded in the >100 cm dbh class in all three sites. Density of the matured trees decreased with increasing DBH whereas, tree basal area tended to increase with increasing DBH in all three sites. Tree species richness was highest in the lower DBH classes. 62.07% of the total tree species regenerated in the largely undisturbed site followed by 50% in the mildly disturbed and 26.32% in the highly disturbed site. The overall regeneration condition was found to be good in the largely undisturbed site. Mildly disturbed site exhibited fair regeneration and so was in the highly disturbed site. Discernable variations in species composition, diversity, regeneration and tree population structure revealed the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on rainforest vegetation dynamics. Higher degree of disturbance was furtherly found not only affecting species diversity but also promoting the growth of invasive weed species. Dominance of Hydnocarpus kurzii and Crypteronia paniculata in the highly disturbed site also indicated that these less-valued timber species may benefit from the vegetation mosaic produced by the disturbance; so differences in abundance of these species may be useful for bio-indication. Furthermore, present study suggests the need of adequate biodiversity conservation measures and adaptation of sustainable forest management approaches in disturbed areas of lowland tropical rainforest in the foothills of eastern Himalaya, India.\\'Abstract: \\'The graphite-tungsten deposits under consideration in this study are located in the Burugubanda, Pydiputta, Tapasikonda, Marripalem and Madyaratigudem areas of the East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, India. These deposits were formed due to wide spread tectonothermal events associated with the evolution of Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt (EGMB). The graphite deposits of East Godavari district are epigenetic, rhombohedral fluid deposited type and are one of the four deposits of such type reported so far from Srilanka, Spain and England. The graphite deposits were formed due to granodioritic intrusion into the Narsipatnam shear zone, which caused migmatisation of khondalites along with mobilisation and concentration of graphite, as veins and lenses, into the graphite gneisses. The graphite gneisses were subsequently intruded by quartz rich pegmatites that were laden with tungsten mineralisation. The tungsten mineralisation occurs as thin bands, lenses, stringers and vein lets within the quartz matrix and also dispersed in the graphite gneisses. Inclusions of tungsten in graphite indicate that tungsten mineralisation succeeded graphite mineralisation. However, the low P-T phenomenon of tungsten (wolframite-ferberite) mineralisation resulted in low tenor of tungsten ore deposits (WO3: 0.10%). Rare earth elements (REE) are associated with tungsten mineralisation in these areas. During the present study, these graphite-tungsten deposits have been re-examined, in the backdrop of shelving graphite-tungsten projects in these areas. The feed for mineral beneficiation tests was decided on the basis of dispersion of tungsten in quartz and graphite rich fractions of the ore zone. The feed (ROM material) on beneficiation gave recovery of +75% graphite concentrate, tungsten concentrate of consistent chemical grade, besides recovery of sizeable REE concentrate. It also rendered use of unutilised graphite tailing dumps at beneficiation plants, thereby effecting conservation. Thus, the association of tungsten and REE with the entire graphite deposits along with their value addition during beneficiation, as by-product, revived opportunities to restart graphite mining in the Burugubanda, Pydiputta and Tapasikonda areas in particular and East Godavari district, in general, as an economically viable venture. This will initiate opening of graphite mines in other districts of Andhra Pradesh and energise economics of working graphite mines within EGMB, in the states of Jharkhand, Odisha and Tamil Nadu.\\'Abstract: \\'This article compares a range of initiatives aimed at involving people in the management of forest resources in Nepal and India. In Nepal, we focus on three categories of state-initiated programs: community forestry, the buffer zone program, and leasehold forestry. In the southern Indian state of Karnataka, we study the state-initiated Joint Forest Planning and Management program along with older institutions of leaf manure forests (Soppina betta) and historical sacred forests (Kans). We conclude that state-initiated approaches to involving communities have been limited, at best, promote standardized and relatively inflexible management practices, and lead to partial improvement in biodiversity and livelihoods. When management is initiated and owned by the community, as in the case of sacred groves in India, and when other conditions are appropriate, communities can have the opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for putting effective and adaptive conservation practices in place.\\'Abstract: \\'The Montane Ecosystem, its decline through numerous human acitivities and its relevance to the development of conservation strategies are described in this article.\\'Abstract: \\'Deforestation is recognized as one of the most significant components in LULCC and global changes scenario. It is imperative to assess its trend and the rate at which it is occurring. The changes will have long-lasting impact on regional climate and in turn on biodiversity. Present study was taken up in Kanakapura and surrounding areas located on the fringes of Western Ghats biodiversity hot-spots. Temporal satellite data from Landsat was classified into forest cover maps. Drivers of forest cover changes such as roads and settlements were used in order to create predicted map of the region using GEOMOD tool in Idrisi Andes. The predicted map was then validated using actual land cover map of same year prepared from Landsat data. The validated map was found to be 84.26 % accurate. The validation was also tested using ROC approach which was found to be 0.614. The model was then further extended to predict forest cover losses for year 2015. The results highlight ongoing deforestation in the areas adjoining Western Ghats. It also presents an application of the tool and the validation methods which can be used in predictive modeling related studies.\\'hypothesis of species migration\\'Abstract: \\' Rhododendron arboreum of the family Ericaceae represents one of the ancient relict tree species of the genus showing extreme disjunction in the Indian subcontinent. It is represented by two sub-species viz., ssp. arboreum Smith in the forests of north-eastern India (temperate) and spp. nilagiricum (Zenker) Tagg distributed in the southern Western Ghats (tropical) of India with apparently no distribution in the intervening plains. 35 Samples corresponding to different locations in the tropical montane forests of Nilgiris and temperate forests of northeast India were analyzed for distribution of genetic variation using 25 random primers. Relatively high genetic diversity was measured in the temperate populations (Ht = 0.21; Nm = 1.13) than tropical Rhododendrons. The hierarchical analysis of molecular variance showed that among the total variance, 25% is residing within populations while 63% of variance is among regions apparently revealing that disjunct distribution has structured genetic differentiation pattern in this species. Grouping of samples was in conformity with their spatial distribution, which was confirmed by UPGMA cluster analysis and PCA scatter plot. The taxon with its unique distribution pattern and wide cross compatibility between sub-species is however threatened by low genetic variation and gene flow that catalyses shifting towards genetic drift and hence long-term conservation strategies need to be formulated particularly for the tropical Rhododendron sub-species. Among the various hypotheses and theory proposed to explain the Malayan affinity in the flora and fauna of Western Ghats, Satpura hypothesis based on dispersal model of distribution largely explains the discontinues distribution of R. arboreum.\\'Abstract: \\'Sacred groves are forest patches conserved by the local people intertwined with their socio-cultural and religious practice. These groves harbour rich biodiversity and play a significant role in the conservation of biodiversity. Population structure and regeneration status of woody species were studied during in the four sacred groves of Manipur, a state in north east India. A total of 96 woody species was recorded from the four groves, the highest being Konthoujam Lairembi sacred grove (55 species) and lowest in Heingang Marjing sacred grove having 42 species. The distribution of woody species in the four groves showed highest stand density and species richness in the lowest girth class and decreased in the succeeding girth classes. Overall population structure of the groves based on the number of tree seedlings, saplings and adults, displayed a greater proportion of seedlings followed by saplings and adults while for the selected tree species it varied seasonally and recruitment of species increased during rainy season attaining peak during June. Regeneration status of the four sacred groves based on strength of different age groups in their population showed good regeneration. High occurrence of to the groves may be due to the invasion through dispersal from other areas. Possibly, the prevailing favourable microenvironmental conditions contributed to their establishment and growth in the groves. Absence of seedlings and saplings of some of the species in the groves may be due to their poor seed germination and establishment of seedlings in the forest.\\'Abstract: \\'We review the current status of experimental studies in India to understand the linkages between afforestation and hydrology. This discipline deals with the use and management of water, social awareness of environmental problems, and ecosystem limitations on provision of watershed services by river basins in the mountain regions of India. Our review begins with examination of experimental works in tropical countries and proceeds to discussion of initiatives of Indian research institutes and Government organizations towards establishing experimental watersheds to understand the impacts of land cover changes on hydrologic regimes in the Indian sub-continent. This is followed by the review of the experimental work carried out by various authors to assess the impact of land cover changes on major water balance components such as, runoff, groundwater, evapotranspiration and sediment yield. The spatial scales of these experiments have been limited to small watersheds or field plots. This paper also describes impacts of human interventions (such as plantations of exotic forest species to restore degraded landscapes) on the water balance components in diverse hydro-geo-environmental conditions in the Indian sub-continent. We focus on identifying the research areas which require immediate attention to develop tools to assist planners and policy makers in assessing and managing the water resources in these complex environments. The review is largely based on research results reported during the last 20 to 30 years.\\'Abstract: \\'Traditional shade coffee plantations of Kodagu district, in the Western Ghats of southern India, harbor a high density and diversity of trees. Local farmers appreciate native biodiversity, but plantation economics and public policies drive them to gradually replace the original diversified cover with exotic shade trees such as Grevillea robusta, which grows fast and can be easily traded as timber. In order to identify and recommend native timber trees with fast growth rates, we compared the growth performance of four common native species against that of G. robusta, by fitting steel dendrometer bands on 332 shade trees. Results showed that in general G. robusta had the fastest growth rates, but large trees of the native Acrocarpus fraxinifolius had faster growth in the wet western side of the district. Computer projections of long term performance showed that most species were influenced by bioclimatic zone. Species-specific local environmental effects also occurred, including competition from coffee bushes for A. fraxinifolius, influence of aspect for G. robusta, and management block effects for Lagerstroemia microcarpa. Our results show that native species  potentially could produce timber at rates equivalent to those of exotic species. However, as in many tropical countries, data on growth rates of native trees within mixed-cover plantations are scarce and this study underlines the urgent need to screen for fast-growing species. Such information provides a strong basis for recommending appropriate changes in public policies that would improve tree tenure security and encourage farmers to grow more native species.\\'Abstract: \\'Tree species diversity and population structure at different community types were described and analyzed for primary and secondary lowland moist deciduous forests in Tripura. Overall 10,957 individual trees belonging to 46 family, 103 genera and 144 species were counted at cm DBH (diameter at breast height) using 28 permanent belt transects with a size of 1 ha (10 m 1000 m). Four different tree communities were identified. The primary forests was dominated by Shorea robusta (mean density 464.77 105 species) and Schima wallichii (336.25 82 species), while the secondary forests was dominated by Tectona grandis (333.88 105 species) and Hevea brasiliensis (299.67 82 species). Overall mean basal area in this study was the maximum value was recorded in primary Shorea forest (26.21 Mean density and diversity indices were differed significantly within four different communities. No significant differences were observed in number of species, genera, family and tree basal cover area. Significant relationships were found between the species richness and different tree population groups across the communities. Results revealed that species diversity and density were increased in those forests due to past disturbances which resulted in slow accumulation of native oligarchic small tree species. Seventeen species were recorded with <2 individuals of which Saraca asoka (Roxb.) de Wilde and Entada phaseoloides (L.) Merr. etc. extensively used in local ethno-medicinal formulations. The present S. robusta Gaertn dominated forest was recorded richer (105 species) than other reported studies. Moraceae was found more speciose family instead of Papilionaceae and Euphorbiaceae than other Indian moist deciduous forests. Seasonal phenological gap in such moist deciduous forests influenced the population of Trachypithecus pileatus and capped langur. The analysis of FIV suggested a slow trend of shifting the population of Lamiaceae group by Moraceae species in secondary T. grandis L. dominated community.\\'Abstract: \\'Molecular techniques are gaining importance in biodiversity conservation in India. They are especially beneficial in the case of rare species with cryptic habits that make them difficult study subjects when using conventional field techniques. Molecular tools can be used to decipher distributions and population connectedness in fragmented habitats and identify populations of immediate conservation concern. We discuss these with case studies on some cat species in India.\\'Abstract: \\'Watersheds from semiarid regions are more sensitive to hydrological processes and sustainability of water resources than humid regions. Hence, it is indispensable to determine the response of watersheds to hydrological processes for water resource management. Thus, the hydrological response-based watershed prioritization study has been undertaken for eight sub-watersheds from semiarid, basaltic region of Western Ghats of India. Intent to this, a novel index has been parameterized using thematic layers such as drainage density, geology, soil, slope, landform classification, land use/land cover, rainfall and runoff (DGSLR). This study evaluates the performance of DGSLR index using three models, namely analytical hierarchy process (AHP), frequency ratio (FR) and fuzzy logic for sub-watershed-wise prioritization. The FR ratio showed the highest value for very high drainage density (8.73) indicating most probability for a high hydrological response. According to AHP weight, most influencing factors to hydrological processes are precipitation (25%), slope (19%) and land use/land cover (14%) followed by landform classification (11%). These three area into four classes, i.e., very high, high, moderate and low using area-weighted average method. These models showed that very high-priority area lies near the outlet of the watershed as well as the upper part of the watershed in high to very high priority in all three models. It covers 33.12% of the total area having a high average slope with high drainage density in sub-watersheds 1, 3, 7 and 8. The predictive capability of DGSLR index was computed by the area under the curve (AUC) and receiver operating method, revealed average accuracy for FR method better than AHP method and fuzzy logic This novel index could be used by the water resources researchers and planners in any terrain to understand the hydrological response.\\'leaf harvest in South India\\'Abstract: \\'Many economically important non-timber forest products (NTFPs) come from widespread and common plant species. Harvest of these species often is assumed to be sustainable due to their commonness. However, because of the ecological roles of common species, harvest may affect and be affected by ecological interactions at harvested in South India to produce brooms, to present a conceptual framework illustrating how intensive harvest of a common species interacts with other anthropogenic management practices, plant-animal interactions and surrounding environmental conditions.\\'Abstract: \\'Rapid clonal propagation and encapsulation of in vitro-formed bulbs of Ipsea malabarica (Reichb. f.) J. D. Hook., an endemic and endangered orchid of the Western Ghats of Kerala, and its reintroduction to the natural habitat were accomplished. Rhizome segments of Ipsea cultured on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 6.97 kinetin induced the highest number of shoots, at the rate of four shoots per explant within 50 d. Transfer of the isolated shoots increased the rate of shoot multiplication to more than 10 shoots. Subsequent culture enhanced the number of shoots. No decline of shoot multiplication was observed up to the 10th subculture. Shoots developed bulbs during culture which developed into rhizomes. Sucrose at reduced the time for the development of bulbs and rhizomes. Roots were developed from the base of the developed shoots as well as from the bulbs. Isolation and culture of bulbs also developed shoots within 50 d. Encapsulated in vitro-formed bulbs cultured either on hormone-free halfstrength MS or 6.97 kinetin-supplemented medium facilitated 100% conversion. As a step to conservation in situ, 50 plantlets were reintroduced into their natural habitat, i.e. at Vellarimala (at 1300 m height) of the Western Ghats of Kerala, and flowered normally. Development of more than 40 000 plantlets starting from a single explant is possible within 250 d. This threatened endemic orchid stands to benefit greatly from the established protocol and will hopefully curtail the threat of extinction.\\'Abstract: \\'Global conservation efforts have traditionally focused on biodiversity hotspots and other priority landscapes. However, large areas outside priority sites have high conservation value and are referred to as neglected landscapes. The Eastern Ghats of India is an unexplored forest landscape of high conservation value with several endemic and threatened species reported, and is also home to many indigenous forest-dwelling communities. However, it remains a neglected area for conservation and only 3.53% of this landscape is protected. Here, we examine the effectiveness of protected areas in neglected landscapes in preventing forest degradation, and how community perceptions can be used to understand satellite-based landscape change analyses at village level. This study was conducted in Papikonda National park (PNP) and its unprotected buffers in Eastern Ghats. Forest degradation was higher in the buffer (32%) than inside PNP (12%) between 1991 and 2014. Communities attributed shifting cultivation, plantations and over-extraction of forest resources as being the major drivers of forest degradation. Community observations of change were not significantly correlated with spatial measures of change. Forest degradation was higher outside the PA at a landscape level and inside the PA at the village level, therefore the PA was effective in reducing degradation at the landscape level but not at the village level inside the PA. We further discuss the role of community observations in interpreting forest degradation in neglected forest landscapes.\\'Abstract: \\'Landslide is one of the devastating natural phenomenon that threatens human life and property. Every year a number of persons lost their lives due to the landslides. Therefore, a better understanding and characterization of landslide is very essential for adopting mitigation strategies to contain the adversities of this natural hazard. Information on landslides from different climatic setup are very essential for better understanding of the influence of weathering, rainfall, or topography on landslide generation. Weathering is one of the important causative factor for landslide generation in the moderate topography or inactive mountainous terrain. The Western Ghats including the Deccan Traps, an inactive mountain range, receives torrential rainfall. Intense rainfall in these areas enhances the weathering processes and fabricates thick soil covers. Mahabaleshwar area, Maharashtra was chosen as a case study, where high elevated part is covered by lateritic layer and each lava flow unit is separated by a thin weathered bed of red bole. The area experiences series of landslides during the summer monsoon months. Mainly two types of landslides have been identified in the area confined with the red bole bed and powdery lateritic soil. The first type of landslides occur at higher elevations where horizontal beds of permeable laterites underlined by impermeable thick basalt beds. The rain water infiltrates down and spread laterally within the permeable lateritic beds. It finally spouts at lower plateau elevations and triggers mainly debris flows. The other category of landslides occurs where the weathered red bole bed separates two successive lava flows. The percolating water from the secondary porosities (joints and inter connected vugs) comes out from the contact zones of basalt and red bole bed in the form of seepages. It erodes the red bole bed and as a result the overlying masses hang and consequently lead to rock fall. The Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) of the representative samples from landslide locations indicates significant weathering. The CIA values for the fine lateritic soil are up to 98% whereas for the red bole bed it varies from 77 to 85%. This suggests a high chemical weathering and higher erodibility. The association of active landslide locations with the red bole bed and fine lateritic soil suggests a close relation between weathering and landslide occurrences in the area.\\'Abstract: \\'India is home to thousands of community-protected forests, called sacred groves. Sacred forests or groves are sites that have cultural or spiritual significance to the people who live around them. These areas may also be key reservoirs of biodiversity. In India, most sacred groves are managed by a community group, not by a government agency. They are often private or community land, not formal protected areas or parks. This poses an interesting challenge in terms of future management and possible policy relating to the sacred groves. On the international level, organizations such as the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and UNESCO have created guidelines for management of sacred sites. On the national level, past Forest Acts and recent Forest Rights Act have relevance to the sacred groves. Local differences in land tenure also affect the groves. Ethnographic research conducted in 2009 and 2010 in the states of Meghalaya and Karnataka, India, evaluated the historic and current management and beliefs associated with sacred forests. Cultural change and pressure to use natural resources within the groves is leading to reduction of these forest areas. In the future, a creative combination of policy approaches to conserve groves that respects their spiritual values is recommended.\\'Abstract: \\'For any conservation strategy to be effective, it must be preceded by knowledge of how diversity is configured within the area of interest. Here, data from 40 savanna-grassland sites were used to examine how plant biodiversity and species composition varied across spatial scales at the Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (KMTR), south India. Grasslands surveyed contained 278 plant species, and were characterized by high spatial variability in species association patterns. Fourteen distinct community assemblages were identified, organized primarily along an elevation gradient in the reserve. Overall, grasslands at KMTR were characterized by the dominance of a few, widespread species. The bulk of species richness, however, resulted from subordinate species with fairly restricted distributions. At low elevations, grasslands had high species richness and species composition differed greatly between sites. Mid-elevation grasslands contained about half the number of species present at low elevations, but sites were more similar in species composition. Richness of high-elevation grasslands was a third of that found at low elevations, but different sites harbored unique sets of species. Herbivore use of grasslands varied between communities and showed patterns that coincided with elevation. Herbivore use of low-elevation communities was high albeit variable, of mid-elevation sites was consistently low, and increased at higher elevations. Tall grass communities were the least utilized by herbivores at all elevations. Most species surveyed were rare and restricted in their distribution suggesting that conservation efforts must, perforce, encompass the entire reserve. However, differences in the structuring of diversity across elevations, and in herbivore use of grasslands, suggest that conservation efforts can be partitioned differentially across locations, specifically targeting low and high elevation grasslands in the reserve.\\'Abstract: \\'The sal (Shorea robusta) forest vegetation of Sohagibarawa Wildlife Sanctuary, Gorakhpur, India was analysed to assess plant diversity, regeneration pattern and the status of species conservation. A total of 208 plant species representing 165 genera and 72 families were recorded. Species richness, mean density and basal area of individuals in the observed forest were compared with those of other sal-dominated forests of India. The sal forest was rich in Papilionaceae (23 species), which contributed maximally to the total number of individuals of <30 cm girth. After sal, density was maximal for a leguminous shrub, Moghania chappar. In addition to the usual recruitment by seed, a number of species also showed non-seed regeneration through storage roots, sprouts or ramet proliferation. The individuals regenerating as sprouts from underground stem or storage organs contributed significantly to the sum total of individuals/ha. As much as 45.5% of the total individuals were of ramet origin and shared 10.6% of the total species richness of the forest. In stands facing moderate to low disturbance, thickets of dense entangled mass of vegetation, predominantly composed of thorny lianas, were identified that usually contained less common and rare species like Rauwolfia serpentina, Desmodium latifolium, Crotalaria alata and Gloriosa superba in addition to the frequent ones. These thickets help to conserve the special habitat conditions and provide protection for natural regeneration of several infrequent and rare plant species and thus contribute towards the maintenance and in situ conservation of overall diversity of recurrently disturbed forest vegetation.\\'Abstract: \\' Curculigo orchioides Gaertn. (family Hypoxidaceae) is an endangered anticarcinogenic and aphrodisiac herb, native of India. This study reports the effect of three arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal inocula on post-transplanting performance of raised C. orchioides plantlets. The three AM fungal inocula consisted of two monospecific cultures of Glomus geosporum and G. microcarpum and one crude consortium of AM fungal spores isolated from rhizosphere soil of C. orchioides growing in natural habitat. Complete plantlets of C. orchioides were raised by direct organogenesis of leaf explants on half strength Murashige and medium devoid of any growth hormone. C. orchioides plantlets responded significantly different to all three mycorrhizal treatments. Mycorrhization enhanced the survival rate of C. orchioides plantlets to 100%. The inoculated plantlets fared significantly better than the uninoculated ones in terms of biomass production and number of leaves and roots per plant. Mycorrhizal plantlets exhibited higher concentrations of photosynthetic pigments as well as minerals P, Mg, Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe in both shoots and roots. Among the three inocula tested, plantlets inoculated with the mixed consortium of AM fungi consistently performed better in terms of the parameters evaluated. The study suggests use of mixed consortium of AM fungi over monospecific cultures for the sustainable cultivation and conservation of endangered medicinal plant: Curculigo orchioides.\\'Abstract: summarize the research on Asian Sun catfish, Horabagrus brachysoma an endemic and threatened freshwater catfish from Western Ghats of India, and provide a comprehensive review of its taxonomy, distribution, biology, population, conservation and aquaculture. Although described in 1864, the taxonomy of H. brachysoma, particularly its familial affinities, continues to be in flux. The species, originally described from the erstwhile of in present day Kerala State, India, has a current distribution ranging from southern Kerala to southern Maharashtra where they are found in lowland westward-flowing rivers, as well as natural freshwater lakes and backwaters. As a much relished food fish, H. brachysoma is exploited throughout its range, predominantly through an unmanaged artisanal fishery. Although there are no scientific estimates of either the status or trends in overall population of this endemic catfish, anecdotal evidence and fisher-knowledge suggests drastic declines of several local populations. The fishery for H. brachysoma in the Periyar and Achenkovil rivers in the State of Kerala has been documented to be unsustainable. As a result of an overall population decline of due to overharvest and habitat loss, H. brachysoma is assessed as on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Primary research on various aspects of feeding, reproductive biology and demography has generated a wealth of information on the species, but this knowledge is yet to be utilized for the development and implementation of in situ conservation or management plans. In view of its high consumer demand, efficient biological and eco-physiological characteristics, as well as the availability of a captive breeding technology, H. brachysoma is considered an emerging species for small-scale aquaculture. Priorities for scientific research to address knowledge-gaps, as well as strategies for effective conservation of this threatened freshwater catfish are discussed.\\'Abstract: \\'Corridors (variably called landscape linkages, connectors, and gateways) are expanses of a landscape that facilitate the flow or movement of individuals, genes, and ecological processes. Protected areas with their buffer zones and the corridors that connect them are cornerstones of modern conservation actions to maintain the biodiversity we have and restore what we have lost. Policy and governance to guide the establishment and management of protected areas and supporting buffer zones is well established in the Central Indian Highlands. A policy and governance structure to create the context and enabling conditions for corridor maintenance, creation, and recovery is emerging but is constrained by the reigning land-management paradigm that separates conservation from development rather than mainstreaming species and habitat conservation into the rural development agenda. Well-nourished, healthy human populations and healthy ecosystems are inextricably linked. The worsening ecological conditions in the Central Indian Highlands can trigger the emergence of a common agenda for an inclusive, caring, and environment-friendly mode of development. The alternative is the business-as-usual scenario: a continuation of worsening ecological conditions. Entry points through the biodiversity, agriculture production, resource extraction, and economic/social sectors to enable integrated sustainable landscape management are identified. These include deepening what it means to successfully conserve a species combined with explicit threat analysis for at-risk tigers and the landscapes that supports them; landscape scenario modeling to advance communication by synthesizing diverse forms of research and articulating and evaluating alternative socio-economic futures; and the use of the smart green infrastructure process as an approach to development rather than only as a way to mitigate environmental damage. Models are presented to scale up from isolated conservation interventions to collective impact that unites supportive government partners with individuals, NGOs, and economic interests to achieve viable long-term relationships in human and natural systems to value, maintain, and recover landscape connectivity.\\'Abstract: \\'This study sought to reconstruct the history of Lantana invasion and spread in India by considering two questions; (a) from where, by who, and when were Lantana species introduced into India? and (b) given its long history in the country, is it still spreading or more or less stable? We critically evaluated the archival and historical information on plant imports by the European powers into India during the period before and after British colonization. We then reconstructed the path of spread by analyzing the spatio-temporal patterns of occurrence and distribution of Lantana in India at both the national and local scale using a GIS platform. The spread of Lantana across the globe started as early as the 1690s. The European colonial powers moved the plants from Latin America to Europe and to their colonial countries in the early 1800s. Lantana species were introduced in India from 1807 onwards and thereafter the colonial powers moved this plant across the country. Following its introduction into India, the spread of Lantana across the country, either through subsequent multiple introductions from Europe to different British cantonments, or through moving the plants between cantonments within India, were reasonably rapid spanning only a few decades. In the absence of a rigorous control program, the spread of Lantana has gone on unabated and thereby impacting both wildlife and biodiversity.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'We make an assessment of the impact of projected climate change on forest ecosystems in India. This assessment is based on climate projections of the Regional Climate Model of the Hadley Centre (HadRM3) and the dynamic global vegetation model IBIS for A2 and B2 scenarios. According to the model projections, 39% of forest grids are likely to undergo vegetation type change under the A2 scenario and 34% under the B2 scenario by the end of this century. However, in many forest dominant states such as Chattisgarh, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh up to 73%, 67% and 62% of forested grids are projected to undergo change. Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is projected to increase by 68.8% and 51.2% under the A2 and B2 scenarios, respectively, and soil organic carbon (SOC) by 37.5% for A2 and 30.2% for B2 scenario. Based on the dynamic global vegetation modeling, we present a forest vulnerability index for India which is based on the observed datasets of forest density, forest biodiversity as well as model predicted vegetation type shift estimates for forested grids. The vulnerability index suggests that upper Himalayas, northern and central parts of Western Ghats and parts of central India are most vulnerable to projected impacts of climate change, while Northeastern forests are more resilient. Thus our study points to the need for developing and implementing adaptation strategies to reduce vulnerability of forests to projected climate change.\\'Abstract: \\'Assessment of tree species diversity, structure and regeneration status of four sacred groves of Kushalnagar, southern Karnataka was carried out. The random quadrat method was employed in each grove for enumeration of tree diversity and regeneration status. A total of 98 tree species belonging to 38 families were found from the sampled areas. These groves possess higher diversity and basal area. Some of species have shown regeneration, while of species had no regeneration. Another of species were reappearing or immigrating. It is observed that increased disturbance was directly proportional to number of reappearing or immigrating species and inversely proportional to the diversity in all the sacred groves. Significant impact on diversity, species richness and regeneration status of the flora due to manifold anthropogenic activities have been recorded.\\'Abstract: relatives are important genetic resources for crop improvement. However, basic information about their population structure, genetic diversity, species relationships and distribution of variation in a gene pool remains scanty in Vigna species. The level of genetic diversity and population genetic structure of representative accessions of cultivated and wild Asiatic Vigna species collected from diversity-rich endemic areas of India have been investigated using both microsatellite markers and morphological descriptors. Forty-one wild and 12 cultivated accessions of 13 Vigna species were genotyped using 53 polymorphic microsatellite markers. A total of 539 alleles were detected among 53 accessions at all loci with an average 10.16 alleles per locus. The major allele frequency varied from 0.16 to 0.65 while polymorphism information content of polymorphic markers ranged from 0.47 to 0.89 The UPGMA revealed five major clusters accommodating of the accessions. The largest cluster accommodated 19 while the smallest cluster had only two accessions. Two accessions, JAP/10-5 and JAP/10-9 of V. trilobata, did not group with any other accession. The model-based population structure analysis also showed almost similar pattern and grouped 53 accessions of Vigna into five genetically distinct sub-populations based on maximum values. multiple range test revealed significant difference between five genetic and one admixture group developed through population structure analysis with 22 morphological descriptors. Analysis of variance for morphological data revealed significant difference in 12 qualitative and quantitative traits including growth habit, terminal leaflet length, colour of petiole base, petiole length, leaf senescence, length of peduncle, raceme position, calyx colour, colour of VSI pod, pod pubescence, pod curvature and 100-seed weight, indicating their significance in distinguishing population groups. The information on genetic diversity and population structure of wild and cultivated accessions of Asiatic Vigna will be tremendously useful to accelerate their use in traitAbstract: \\'The Western Ghats of India, one of the global biodiversity hotspots and freshwater eco-regions, harbors several fish species which not just form the important part of the freshwater biodiversity yet in addition are the vital segment of livelihood of the neighborhood population. The rate of fish decline in the Western Ghats is alarming. The absence of organized study and data scarcity on basic biology and life history traits of several species could be one reason behind the decline, and thus it is difficult to execute conservation action/s. This is especially true, particularly for data-deficient species for which definite data related to distribution, population size, and trend is not available. The present study deals with the detailed investigation of population dynamics of catfish species, Pachypterus khavalchor, which is data-deficient species inhabiting the Western Ghats of India and forms an important component of freshwater inland fishery, providing nutritional and financial security to the local community.\\'Abstract: \\'In order to ensure that threatened species are included in the conservation of our biological diversity, it is necessary to prioritise species and thus by landscape or implement measure for prioritised area. This requires geographical data specifying the places where threatened plants grow and the qualitative descriptions of environmental variables with which they are associated. The fundamental niche can be viewed as the set of environmental conditions and resources that allow a given species to survive and reproduce in the absence of biotic interactions. To survive and avoid competition for the same resources, a species usually occupies only a part of its fundamental niche in a particular community or ecosystem that is its realized niche. Currently available floras, which provide valuable information about the species distribution pattern, do not indicate specific locations or the qualitative descriptions of environmental variables with which they are associated. In the present study realized niches of the threatened plant species of Peppara Wildlife Sanctuary were gathered using Global Positioning System (GPS) and distribution and abundance of each species were measured by stratified random sampling techniques. The realized niches of each threatened species were gathered by GPS and inductive habitat suitability assessment modelling has been done in Geographic Information System (GIS) along with environmental, edaphic, topographic and phytosociological data for their fundamental niche. The study resulted in documenting 151 tree species belonging to 51 families with eight threatened species. The distribution of each threatened species, their realized niches and its status, ecological amplitude among forest types and their geographical positions in the landscape were documented and mapped. This will lead to the exact locality information of the concerned taxa, their population status, edaphic and climatic characters of their habitat, their niche width, potential localities to be searched, knowledge of their habitat requirements; particularly the factors limiting their distributions, the factors leading to local and biological extinction and critical habitats.\\'Abstract: \\'In vitro techniques have found increasing use in the conservation of threatened plants in recent years and this trend is likely to continue as more species face risk of extinction. The Micropropagation Unit at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, UK (RBG Kew) has an extensive collection of in vitro plants including many threatened species from throughout the world. The long history of the unit and the range of plants cultured have enabled considerable expertise to be amassed in identifying the problems and developing experimental strategies for propagation and conservation of threatened plants. While a large body of knowledge is available on the in vitro culture of plants, there are limited publications relating to threatened plant conservation. This review highlights the progress in in vitro culture and conservation of threatened plants in the past decade and suggests future research directions. Works on non-threatened plants are also included wherever methods have applications in rare plant conservation. Recalcitrant plant materials collected from the wild or ex situ collections are difficult to grow in culture. Different methods of sterilization and other treatments to establish clean material for culture initiation are reviewed. Application of different culture methods for multiplication, and use of unconventional materials for rooting and transplantation are reviewed. As the available plant material for culture initiation is scarce and in many cases associated with inherent problems such as low viability and endogenous contamination, reliable protocols on multiplication, rooting, and storage methods are very important. In this context, photoautotrophic micropropagation has the potential for development as a routine method for the in vitro conservation of endangered plants. Long-term storage of material in culture is challenging and the potential applications of cryopreservation are significant in this area. Future conservation biotechnology research and its applications must be aimed at conserving highly threatened, mainly endemic, plants from conservation hotspots.\\'Abstract: \\'The Deccan Traps or the basalts of western India are the largest exposure of basic lava flows covering about Groundwater occurrence in the Deccan Traps is in phreatic condition in the weathered zone above the hard rock and in semi-confined condition in the fissures, fractures, joints, cooling cracks, lava flow junctions and in the inter-trappean beds between successive lava flows, within the hard rock. Dug wells, dug-cum-bored wells and boreholes or bore wells are commonly used for obtaining groundwater. The yield is small, usually in the range of The average land holding per farming family is only around Recently, due to the ever increasing number of dug wells and deep bore wells, the water table has been falling in several watersheds, especially in those lying in the semi-arid region of the traps, so that now the emphasis has shifted from development to sustainable management. Issues like climatic change, poverty mitigation in villages, sustainable development, rapid urbanization of the population, and resource pollution have invited the attention of politicians, policy makers, government agencies and non-governmental organizations towards watershed management, forestation, soil and water conservation, recharge augmentation and, above all, the voluntary control of groundwater abstraction in the Deccan Traps terrain.\\'Abstract: \\'Ganges River dolphin, Platanista gangetica gangetica, is one of the three obligatory freshwater dolphins in the world and is distributed in the and River systems in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. This species is facing considerable threats to its survival, and its population has dwindled from 4000 to 5000 in the early 1980s to 3500 in 2014 in the distribution range. This article reviews current status of the sub-species, habitat use, and the potential threats that the dolphins face for their survival (details of taxonomic status and genetics, evolutionary adaptations and anatomical peculiarities, physical adaptation, primitive characteristics, biology, behavior, surfacing behavior and dive times, mating and birth, and life span/age have been placed as Electronic Supplementary Materials). Recommendations have been made for the protection and developing strategies for the conservation of this Endangered and endemic sub-species.\\'Abstract: \"This paper aims to throw light on the mass extinction that is overtaking Earth\\'s species. Using an analytic methodology developed for an earlier partial assessment, it focuses on a series of areas, these being areas that (a) feature exceptional concentrations of species with high levels of endemism, and (b) face exceptional threats of destruction. The paper identifies another eight such areas, four of them in tropical forests and four in Mediterranean-type zones. The analysis reveals that the four tropical-forest areas contain at least 2,835 endemic plant species in 18,700 km2, or 1.1 percent of Earth\\'s plant species in 0.013 percent of Earth\\'s land surface; and that the four Mediterranean-type areas contain 12,720 endemic plan: species in 435,700 km2, or 5.1 percent of Earth\\'s plant species in 0.3 percent of the Earth\\'s land surface. Taken together, these eight hot-spot areas contain 15,555 endemic plant species in 454,400 km2, or 6.2 percent of Earth\\'s plant species in 0.3 percent of Earth\\'s land surface. This is to be compared with the earlier hot-spots analysis of 10 tropical-forest areas, with 34,400 endemic plant species in 292,000 km2, or 13.8 percent of Earth\\'s plant species in 0.2 percent of Earth\\'s land surface.\"Abstract: \\'One-hectare plots were sampled for bird species diversity in the Uttara Kannada district. These plots represented well-preserved evergreen/semievergreen forests, secondary/moist deciduous forests showing different levels of degradation by man and plantations of teak, eucalypts and betelnut. It was found that the betelnut plantation and the evergreen/semievergreen forests had the least bird species diversity = 2.58 and 2.61 respectively. The eucalypt and teak plantations = 2.69 and 2-92 respectively. In the secondary/moist deciduous forests it ranged from Despite the apparent increase in diversity in the man-modified vegetation types, it was found that there was a gradual displacement of the bird species composition from what was typical to the evergreen forests to those of more urban and scrubby habitats in these man-modified vegetation types. This was particularly so in the eucalypt plantation.\\'Abstract: \\'Tropical forests have been recognized as having global conservation importance. However, they are being rapidly destroyed in many regions of the world. Regular monitoring of forests is necessary for an adaptive management approach and the successful implementation of ecosystem management. The present study analyses the temporal changes in forest ecosystem structure in tribal dominated Malkangiri district of Orissa, India, during period based on digitized forest cover maps using geographic information system (GIS) and interpretation of satellite data. Three satellite images Landsat MSS (1973), Landsat TM (1990) and IRS P6 LISS III (2004) were used to determine changes. Six land cover types were delineated which includes dense forest, open forest, scrub land, agriculture, barren land and water body. Different forest types were also demarcated within forest class for better understanding the degradation pattern in each forest types. The results showed that there was a net decrease of 475.7 km2 forest cover (rate of deforestation = 2.34) from 1973 to 1990 and 402.3 km2 (rate of deforestation = 2.27) from 1990 to 2004. Forest cover has changed over time depending on a few factors such as large-scale deforestation, shifting cultivation, dam and road construction, unregulated management actions, and social pressure. A significant increase of 1222.8 km2 agriculture area clearly indicated the conversion of forest cover to agricultural land. These alterations had resulted in significant environmental consequences, including decline in forest cover, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity. There is an urgent need for rational management of the remaining forest for it to be able to survive beyond next decades. Particular attention must be paid to tropical forests, which are rapidly being deforested.\\'Abstract: \\'Flying squirrels are capable of gliding and one of the least known mammals of the world. Work on these animals is less and sporadic due to their crepuscular and cryptic habits. At the present scenario, a complete pilot study is in an urgent need to formulate conservation strategies and policies to conserve them in India. Therefore, a thorough review on biology and conservation status of flying squirrels in India is provided here. A total of 13 species of flying squirrels present in India i.e., Belomys pearsonii, Biswamoyopterus biswasi, Eupetaurus cinereus, Eoglaucomys fimbriatus, Hylopetes alboniger, Petaurista elegans, P. mishmiensis, P. magnificus, P. mechukaensis, P. nobilis, P. petaurista, P. philippensis and Petinomys fuscocapillus, wherein three are endemic to the country. P. philippensis has broader distribution and is found to be more studied than others. Eastern part of the country contains the highest species number follows three in northern part, two in southern part and one in western part subsequently. All species are facing threat to their population due to native habitat loss, degradation and hunting. Harmonization, alliances and partnership between various stakeholders along with better application of standard techniques would be strengthen to develop conservation strategies and implementing their coordinated actions could preserve flying future in the country landscape.\\'Abstract: \\' Gonoproktopterus curmuca is an endangered red tailed barb found in Southern part of Western Ghat, India. As a part of stock-specific, propagation assisted rehabilitation and management program, polymorphic microsatellites markers were used to study the genetic diversity and population structure of this species from the three River systems of Southern Western Ghats, such as Periyar River, the Chalakkudy River, and the Chaliyar River. From selected eight polymorphic microsatellite markers, the number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 8, and the average number of alleles among 3 populations ranged from 5.0 to 5.75. The mean observed (Hob) and expected (Hex) heterozygosity ranged from 0.5148 to 0.5360 and from 0.5996 to 0.6067, respectively. Significant deviations from Equilibrium expectation were found at majority of the loci (except Gcur MFW72 and Gcur MFW19) and in all three populations in which heterozygote deficits were apparent. The analysis of molecular variance indicates that the percent of variance among populations and within populations were 6.73 and 93.27, respectively. The pairwise FST values between populations indicate that there were significant deviations in genetic differentiations for the red-tailed barb populations from these three Rivers of the Western Ghats, India. The microsatellites methods reported a low degree of gene diversity and lack of genetic heterogeneity in the population of G. curmuca, which strongly emphasize the need of fishery management, conservation and rehabilitation of G. curmuca.\\'Abstract: \"Reducing carbon Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) is of central importance to combat climate change. Foremost among the challenges is quantifying nation\\'s carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation, which requires information on forest carbon storage. Here we estimated carbon storage in India\\'s forest biomass for the years 2003, 2005 and 2007 and the net flux caused by deforestation and degradation, between two assessment periods i.e., Assessment Period first (ASP I), 2003-2005 and Assessment Period second (ASP II), 2005-2007.\"Abstract: \\'The montane closed evergreen forests found at altitudes above 1,800 m in the Western Ghats of India possess a distinct vegetation type and are called shola forests. Despite the fact that these forests are located in relatively inaccessible areas, they are still under anthropogenic pressure leading to continued habitat degradation and loss of biomass and biodiversity. A case study was conducted in Mananvan shola, the largest shola forest in Kerala of Western Ghats, to recognize the impact of disturbance on vegetation structure, composition and regeneration pattern, to identify the socio-economic reasons for disturbance and to evolve strategies for its management. In the disturbed part of the forest, dominance of light demanding species in tree, shrub and herb communities has been recorded. Here even the dominance of exotic species in tree seedling, shrub and herb communities is prominent. Skewed girth class distribution of tree community with poor representation by the individuals of girth class 30.1 to 90.0 cm, is also an indication of the collection of small wood and poles from the forest. The RISQ (Ramakrishnan Index of Stand Quality) in the disturbed area of the forest is above 2.0 as against near to 1.0 in relatively undisturbed forest stands suggesting that the disturbance is intensive and thus natural recovery process would be slow. Socioeconomic analysis in villages located near the shola forest revealed the fact that the people depended heavily on this forest for their livelihood. Thus, the crux and the success of future management and conservation strategy depend on how one can reduce the dependency of people on the shola vegetation. Enrichment planting in disturbed parts of shola, enhancement of firewood by raising energy plantations, as well as development of lemongrass and firewood based agroforestry systems and reduction of grazing pressure by developing silvopastoral systems are the major strategies for the conservation of these shola forests.\\'Abstract: \\'Species richness and density of understory plants were investigated in eight plots, distributed one each in undisturbed and disturbed tropical evergreen, semi-evergreen, deciduous and littoral forests of Little Andaman island, India, which falls under one of the eight hottest hotspots of Biodiversity in the world viz. the Indo-Burma. One hundred quadrats were established in each plot, in which all the understory plants (that include herbs, undershrubs, shrubs and herbaceous climbers) were enumerated. The total density of understory plants was 6,812 individuals and species richness was 108 species, representing 104 genera and 50 families. Across the four forest types and eight study plots, the species richness ranged from 10 to All the disturbed sites harbored greater number of species than their undisturbed counterparts. Herbs dominated by species (63%) and density (4,259 individuals). The grass Eragrostis tenella (1,860 individuals; IVI 40), the invasive climber Mikania cordata (803; IVI 20) and the shrub Anaxagorea luzonensis (481; IVI 17.5) were the most abundant species. Poaceae, Asteraceae, Acanthaceae, Orchidaceae and Euphorbiaceae constituted the species-rich families represented by 6 species each. The species-area curves attained an asymptote at level except in sites DD and DL, indicating plot is not sufficient to capture all the understory species in disturbed forests. The alien weeds formed about one-fourth of the species richness (31 species; 28%) and density (1,926 individuals; 28.3%) in the study sites, indicating the extent of weed invasion and the attention required for effective conservation of the native biodiversity of the fragile island forest ecosystem.\\'Abstract: \\'The last four decades have seen an increasing integration of phylogenetics and biogeography. However, a dearth of phylogenetic studies has precluded such biogeographic analyses in South Asia until recently. Noting the increase in phylogenetic research and interest in phylogenetic biogeography in the region, we outline an integrative framework for studying taxon distribution patterns. While doing so, we pay particular attention to challenges posed by the complex geological and ecological history of the region, and the differences in distribution across taxonomic groups. We outline and compare three widely used phylogenetic biogeographic approaches: topology-based methods (TBMs), pattern-based methods (PBMs) and event-based methods (EBMs). TBMs lack a quantitative framework and utilize only part of the available phylogenetic information. Hence, they are mainly suited for preliminary enquiries. Both PBMs and EBMs have a quantitative framework, but we consider the latter to be particularly suited to the South Asian context since they consider multiple biogeographic processes explicitly, and can accommodate a reticulated history of areas. As an illustration, we present a biogeographic analysis of endemic Sri Lankan agamid lizards. The results provide insights into the relative importance of multiple processes and specific zones in the radiation of two speciose lizard clades.\\'Abstract: \\'The members of the genus Muntiacus are of particular interest to evolutionary biologists due to their extreme chromosomal rearrangements and the ongoing discussions about the number of living species. Red muntjacs have the largest distribution of all muntjacs and were formerly considered as one species. Karyotype differences led to the provisional split between the Southern Red Muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak) and the Northern Red Muntjac (M. vaginalis), but uncertainties remain as, so far, no phylogenetic study has been conducted. Here, we analysed whole mitochondrial genomes of 59 archival and 16 contemporaneous samples to resolve uncertainties about their taxonomy and used red muntjacs as model for understanding the evolutionary history of other species in Southeast Asia.\\'Abstract: \\'Mahseer species, the national heritage of India are globally acclaimed sport and table fish. Some mahseer species are now assessed as making it imperative to review historical and current state of knowledge on sport-related facets, taxonomy, fisheries ecology, biology, culture and conservation efforts. The review also examines the shortfalls in knowledge base and suggests issues that need to be addressed in future. The protection and conservation measures have fallen short of expectations as the pace of implementing mega-developmental projects exceeds natural recruitment rate of mahseers and lack of facilities for assisted propagation, at larger scale.\\'Abstract: \\'This research paper assesses the vulnerability of landslide for the Bodi-Bodimettu Ghat section, Theni district, Tamil Nadu, India, using remotely sensed data and geographic information system (GIS). Landslide database was generated using IRS-1C satellite LISS III data and aerial photographs accompanied by field investigations using differential global positioning system to generate a landslide inventory map. Topographical, spatial, and field data were processed to construct the spatial thematic layers using image processing and GIS environment. Twelve landslide-inducing factors were used for landslide vulnerability analysis: elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, proximity to road, drainage and lineament, land use/land cover, geology, geomorphology, and run-off. The first five factors were derived from digital elevation model, and other thematic layers were prepared from spatial database. Frequency ratio of each factor was computed using the above thematic factors with past landslide locations. Landslide vulnerability map was produced using raster analysis. The landslide vulnerability map was classified into five zones: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The model is validated using the relative landslide density index (R-index method). The consistency of R-index indicates good performance of the vulnerability map.\\'Abstract: \\'Turtles are one of the oldest groups of reptiles in the world and India has a large and diverse assemblage of extant turtles. While the North and Northeast parts of India are higher in turtle diversity, peninsular India has all the three endemic turtles. The Cane turtle and the Travancore tortoise are two endemic forest dwelling turtles. Until recently, very little was known about the ecology of these two turtles. I spent five years during my PhD studying their behaviour and ecology in the WesternGhats. In this article, I share general information on evolution of turtles and some of my findings on the behaviour and ecology of these two endemic turtles of India.\\'Abstract: \\'Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary in southern India plays an important role in biodiversity conservation, especially of large mammals, by offering habitat contiguity of about 3300 km2 with three other protected areas in the region, namely Nagarahole and Bandipur National Parks and Wynaad Wildlife Sanctuary through forest corridors between the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats forests. The habitat linkage is crucial for large ranging animals such as elephants, which use these forest corridors for migration. Livestock grazing, a major biotic interference in forest corridors, originates from seven settlements of the Masinagudi group of villages on the eastern and the southeastern fringes of the sanctuary. Construction of a series of hydroelectric power stations, numbering about three at Singara, Marvakandy (Masinagudi) and Moyar, around the Masinagudi villages caused a rapid growth in human population (143% between 1961 and 1991), particularly the landless labourers and livestock. Free grazing by about 15 000 resident as well as migratory livestock every year in and around the forest corridors, coupled with removal of cattle dung from the forest floor, have adversely affected the forest regeneration and helped proliferation of weed species such as Lantana camara, Casia tora, C. occidentalis, Opuntia dillenii, and Ageratum conyzoides. The annual fodder production from the corridor forest could meet the demand of about two-thirds of the resident population, while the crop residues from the marginal agriculture could not support the remaining one-third livestock population. In view of such a situation, measures have been suggested to reduce livestock population and implement the ecodevelopment packages in order to ensure the corridor connectivity for the long-term conservation of the elephant population.\\'Abstract: \\'India, a mega-diverse country, possesses a wide range of climate and vegetation types along with a varied topography. The present study has classified forest types of India based on multi-season IRS Resourcesat-2 Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) data. The study has characterized 29 land use/land cover classes including 14 forest types and seven scrub types. Hybrid classification approach has been used for the classification of forest types. The classification of vegetation has been carried out based on the ecological rule bases followed by Champion and (1968) scheme of forest types in India. The present classification scheme has been compared with the available global and national level land cover products. The natural vegetation cover was estimated to be of total geographical area of India. The predominant forest types of India are tropical dry deciduous and tropical moist deciduous. Of the total forest cover, tropical dry deciduous forests occupy an area of followed by under tropical moist deciduous forests, under tropical semi-evergreen forests and under tropical wet evergreen forests. The study has brought out a comprehensive vegetation cover and forest type maps based on inputs critical in defining the various categories of vegetation and forest types. This spatially explicit database will be highly useful for the studies related to changes in various forest types, carbon stocks, climate-vegetation modeling and biogeochemical cycles.\\'Abstract: \\'Quantitative assessment of tree species diversity from sample plots in seven forest ranges of Nayagarh Forest Division in Odisha state in the Eastern Ghats of India was made during the period April, 2011 to November, 2013. A total of 120 transects were laid in Nayagarh, Odogaon, Pancharida, Khandapada, Dasapalla, Mahipur, and Gania forest ranges and tree stems of at least GBH were measured. The regeneration potential of trees was assessed from sample plots located within the main transect. A total of 177 tree species belonging to 120 genera and 44 families were recorded from the study area. Shorea robusta, Buchanania lanzan, Lannea coromandelica, Terminalia alata and Cleistanthus collinus were the predominant tree species. The stand density varied in the range of while basal area ranged from 7.77 to The tree density and species richness decreased with increasing girth class. The highest number of species and maximum density was recorded in the girth class of The and Simpson Indices with respect to trees with GBH varied in the range of and respectively and the values of diversity indices are within the reported range for tropical forests of Indian sub-continent. The families, Dipterocarpaceae, Anacardiaceae, Combretaceae and Euphorbiaceae contributed to maximum species richness, stand density, and basal area. Regeneration of many tree species was observed to be poor. The present study provides baseline data for further ecological studies, forest management, and formulation of site-specific strategies for conservation of biological diversity in moist deciduous forests of Eastern India.\\'Abstract: \\' Aerides maculosum Lindl is one of the most important orchids valued for its beautiful inflorescence/flowers. The present study aimed to understand the level of genetic variation among the populations of A. maculosum using RAPD and ISSR markers. Among the 35 primers tested, 13 RAPD and 6 ISSR primers were selected for the analysis. Total of 101 RAPD and 40 ISSR fragments were generated. High level of polymorphism was recorded in RAPD (90.45%) compared to ISSR (72.85 %). average genetic identity values for different populations of A. maculosum- ranged from 0.465 to 0.762 (RAPD), while for ISSR it ranged from 0.475 to 0.975. The present study provides important insights about genetic variation in A. masculosum and may facilitates the conservation and management of this species.\\'conservation of the threatened tree species\\'Abstract: \\'Information on geographic distribution, population and threat status of most globally red listed species in the Indo Burma zone are inadequate. Given the increase in the prevalence of isolated forest patches in the part of this hotspot, evaluation is necessary on how size of the remnant forest patches and on-going disturbances affects structure and diversity of remaining habitats including the population of some globally threatened tree species. Quantitative vegetation inventory by 500 m long and 10 m wide (0.5 ha) line transects were randomly set in nine fragmented tropical semi-evergreen forest patches in Tripura, Northeast India. The studied forests patches grouped into small, medium and large based on their respected sizes. Spatial variability was analysed in woody species diversity and structure along the patch size gradients and their response to both patch size and anthropogenic disturbances. Out of 167 species, 13 identified as red-listed species by IUCN under the present inventory. Most of the diversity and structural parameters showed statistically significant positive response with the forest patch size, except for stand dominance, disturbance, sapling density and number of aggregated distribution pattern decreased when patch size increased. In addition, most of the diversity and structural attributes showed negative response with disturbances. Present baseline data would serve as an effective tool for management and protection of this important forest type. Future habitat restoration programme and strategies for relocation of additional population and re-introduction of those globally threatened trees are recommended.\\'Abstract: \\'There is still large uncertainty over the status of global forest cover owing to the paucity of comprehensive and holistic studies related to long term changes in natural forests of India. This analysis facilitated the determination of the state of Indian forest cover changes over last eight decades. Here, we have mapped the total area under forest cover, evaluated the spatial tracking of changes in natural forests, estimated the rate of deforestation and afforestation, analysed the biogeographic zone wise and state wise forest cover change, existing land use in deforested area, influence of environmental factors such as terrain on deforestation and implication of different definitions of forest used by agencies reporting deforestation in India. The results indicated that forests covered an area of in 1930 which has decreased to in 2013, a net loss of in eight decades. The highest annual average forest loss was found to be during during during during and during Between 1930 and 1975, forest experienced large scale deforestation at gross annual rate of which has declined to and for the and periods respectively. Quantification of annual rate of gross deforestation for the recent period indicates during and during The lower rates of deforestation during recent period support effectiveness of conservation measures taken at national level. It was found that deforestation rate has decreased in many biogeographic zones by 2005, except for Andaman & Nicobar Islands and North East. The major deforestation has mostly occurred due to conversion of forests to agriculture. The construction of reservoirs contributed to of forest loss. The tropical forests have experienced large scale deforestation followed by subtropical forests. The findings of the study will be useful to prioritize conservation and protection of forest cover at the regional level. It shall also provide a base for future research on the impacts of deforestation on carbon flux and biodiversity.\\'Abstract: \\'The present study assesses anthropogenic disturbances and their impacts on the vegetation in Western Himalaya, India on the basis of various disturbance parameters such as density, Total Basal Cover (TBC) of cut stumps, lopping percentage and grazing intensities. On the basis of canopy cover and frequency of disturbances (%), the studied forests were divided into highly disturbed (HD), moderately disturbed (MD) and least disturbed (LD) categories. The HD forests had the lowest canopy cover, lowest density and lowest TBC and the LD had the highest canopy cover, highest density and highest TBC. The MD forests occupied the intermediate position with respect to these parameters. Species richness was least in HD forests, highest in one of the MD forests while LD forest occupied an intermediate position. The percentage of regenerating species was lowest (54%) in HD and highest (72%) in MD. The density of seedlings and saplings was higher in one of the MD forests as compared to HD and LD. We concluded that the moderate disturbances do not affect the vegetation adversely; however the increased degree of disturbance causes loss in plant diversity; affects regeneration and changes community characteristics. Construction of hydroelectric projects at various places in the study area was found to be one of the most important sources of anthropogenic disturbances in addition to the routine anthropogenic disturbances like grazing, fuelwood collection and fodder extraction. If all proposed dams in the Indian Himalaya are constructed combined with weak national environmental impact assessment and implementation, it will result in a significant loss of species. Therefore, various agents of disturbances should be evaluated in cumulative manner and any developmental activities such as hydropower projects, which trigger various natural and anthropogenic disturbances, should be combined with proper cumulative environmental impact assessment and effective implementation to minimise the anticipated loss of vegetation.\\'Abstract: \\'The key aspect in planning and management of water resources is to analyze the runoff potential and erosion status of the river basin. For the detailed investigation of hydrological response, freely available Cartosat-1 (IRS-P5) data was used for the preparation of digital elevation model (DEM). The runoff potential and type of erosive process of 22 river basins originating in the global biodiversity hotspot of Western Ghats, was inferred through hypsometric analysis. Several parameters like Hypsometric integral (HI), maximum concavity (Eh), coordinates of slope inflection point (I) given by a* and h* and normalized height of hypsometric curve (h) were extracted from the hypsometric curves and used for understanding the hydrological responses. From the hypsometric curves, the landform evolution processes were inferred. Contribution of diffusive and fluvial processes in slope degradation of the river basins was understood. Basins with lesser area (<100 km2) were found to have a positive correlation between hypsometric integral and basin area, whereas for large basins no such correlation exists. Based on the study, river basins can be prioritized for the appropriate conservation measures.\\'Abstract: \\'The microbes living in planta termed is bestowed with the potential to produce bioactive substances. The aim of this investigation was focused on the isolation and molecular identification of the fungal endophytes from Zingiber nimmonii (J. Graham) Dalzell., an endemic medicinal plant species of the a hotspot location in southern India and characterization of the secondary metabolites responsible for the antioxidant and DNA protective capacity using chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques.\\'Abstract: \\'I studied ecomorphological correlations in 18 stream fish species (belonging to five families) commonly occurring in diversity rich habitats of rivers in the central Western Ghats (Southern India). Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated a clear segregation of species in morphological and ecological (habitat) space. Cluster analyses using morphological features segregated species based mainly on their body shape and feeding parameters while habitat parameters segregated species according to their position along the water column and preference to runs or pool habitats. Principal component analyses showed that body size, head dimensions, mouth position and eye diameter were important characters for species segregation in morphological space while run or pool habitat type and the position of the fish in the water column best explained segregation of species in habitat space. Consistencies in some of the species clusters obtained from analyses on morphological characteristics and habitat preferences warrant closer examination of the relationships between them. These were studied employing multivariate methods like canonical correspondence analysis and the Mantel test. The tests revealed weak correlations indicating that in addition to morphology, other factors like behavioural, physiological and evolutionary constraints together are likely to play an important role in ecosystem structuring of these complex tropical assemblages.\\'Abstract: \\'Species composition, diversity and tree population structure were studied in three stands of the tropical wet evergreen forest in and around Namdapha National Park, Arunachal Pradesh, India. Three study stands exposed to different intensities of disturbances were identified, viz., undisturbed in the core zone of the park, moderately disturbed in the periphery of the park and highly disturbed outside the park area. In total 200 plant species belonging to 73 families were recorded in three stands. Tree density and basal area showed a declining trend with the increase in disturbance intensity. The densities of tree saplings and seedlings were lower in the disturbed stands than in the undisturbed stand. Species like Altingia excelsa, Olea dioica, Terminalia chebula, Mesua ferrea and Shorea assamica in the undisturbed stand and Albizia procera alone in the moderately disturbed stand contributed more than 50% of the total tree density in respective stands. The undisturbed stand contained young tree population. In the highly disturbed stand, the tree density was scarce, but had uncut trees of higher girth class GBH). Low shrub density was recorded in both disturbed stands due to frequent human disturbances; the broken canopy and direct sunlight enhanced the abundance of herbs in these stands. With a species rarity (species having <2 individuals) of ca. 50%, the tropical wet evergreenforests of the Namdapha National Park and its adjacent areas warrant more protection from human intervention and also eco-development to meet the livelihood requirements of the local inhabitants in the peripheral areas of the Namdapha National Park in order to reduce the anthropogenic pressure on the natural resources of the park.\\'Abstract: \\'Species diversity, population structure, abundance and dispersion patterns of all woody plants gbh were inventoried in two 1-ha plots of tropical dry evergreen (sacred grove or temple) forests at Kuzhanthaikuppam (KK) and Thirumanikkuzhi (TM) on the Coromandel coast of south India. Site KK is a stunted forest (average tree height ca 6 m) and TM a tall forest (average tree height ca 10 m). A total of 54 species (in 47 genera and 31 families) were recorded. Species richness and stand density were 42 and 38 species and 1367 and 974 individuals respectively for the sites KK and TM. About 50% of the total species were common to both the sites. Site TM is twofold more voluminous (basal area 29.48 m2 than KK (basal area 15.44 m2 Nearly one third of the individuals are multi-stemmed in the low-statured site KK whereas one fourth of the tree density is multi-stemmed in TM. Species abundance pattern varied between the two sites. The abundance of three species in KK and two species in TM is pronounced. Memecylon umbellatum, the most abundant species contributing to one third of total stand density in KK, is least represented in TM. Species richness, density and diversity indices decreased with increasing girth threshold. Most species exhibited clumped dispersion of individuals both at 0.25 and 1-ha scales. Population structure for girth frequency is an expanding one for both the sites, except for basal area distribution in KK. Variations in plant diversity and abundance are related to site attributes and human impacts. In the light of habitat uniqueness, species richness and sacred grove status, the need for conservation is emphasized.\\'Abstract: \\'Twenty soil communities from the northeastern forests (Assam) and the Western Ghats (Maharashtra) were screened for the presence of the lysine aminotransferase (lat) gene fromNocardia. Hybridization probes and primers were synthesized in accordance with the reported sequence of theNocardia lat gene from GenBank (number: G1 49355). Seven positives were obtained from the 20 soils. Six of the seven positive were from the Western Ghats and one from the northeast Assam forests. Eighteen actinomycete isolates from the 7 positive soils showed the presence of thelat gene. Only 9 isolates actually produced an antibiotic. These results are discussed.\\'Abstract: \\'Since the first report on Camptothecin detection in Nothapodytes nimmoniana by Govindachari and Viswanathan (Phytochem 1972), considerable work has been done on biotechnology and its applications on the species. Plant tissue culture techniques have applications in clonal propagation, CPT production, and conservation of N. nimmoniana. Discovery of CPT production by endophytes existing in symbiotic association with N. nimmoniana has provided new insights into finding alternative sources of the alkaloid. Development of molecular markers such as RFLP, RAPD, ISSR, and AFLP has facilitated understanding of population ecology and genetics of the species. Molecular information generated from these studies is promising in establishing strategies for conservation and sustainable use of N. nimmoniana populations under overexploitation pressure. The advances in instrumentation in the 20th century, such as desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry allowed CPT analysis in tissues without sample pretreatment. Other ancient techniques for qualitative and quantitative analysis such as chromatography, spectroscopy, and H1-NMR are applied in the detection of CPT due to variable sensitivity to the alkaloid. The review covers work on plant tissue culture for clonal propagation and CPT production in N. nimmoniana. Besides symbiotic endophyte sources of CPT in N. nimmoniana, population genetics studies and instrumentation analysis of the alkaloids are reviewed.\\'Abstract: \\'Aglaia bourdillonii is a plant narrowly endemic to the southern portion of the Western Ghats (WG), in peninsular India. To understand its ecological and geographic distribution, we used ecological niche modeling (ENM) based on detailed distributional information recently gathered, in relation to detailed climatic data sets. The ENMs successfully reconstructed key features of the geographic distribution, focusing almost entirely on the southern WG. Much of the distributional potential is already under protection, but our analysis allows identification of key zones for additional protection, all of which are adjacent to existing protected areas. ENM provides a useful tool for understanding the natural history of such rare and endangered species.\\'Abstract: \\'The study demonstrates the potential of geographical information system and statistical-based approaches to identify the hydrological processes and demarcate the groundwater prospect zones of the Gangolli basin, Karnataka State, India. The basin is situated in humid tropical climate and influenced by three major rivers viz. Kollur (6th order stream), Chakra (6th order stream) and Haladi (7th order stream) which cover an area of and cumulative length of Various thematic geomorphology, geology, slope, soil, lineament and lineament prepared using Survey of India topographic maps, Indian remote sensing (IRS-P6) images and other published maps. Hydrogeomorphologic characteristics were correlated with different morphometric parameters to identify the hydrological processes and demarcate the groundwater potential zones of the basin. All the hydrological units and morphometric parameters were assigned suitable weightages according to their relative importance to groundwater potentiality to identify the most deficit/surplus zones of groundwater. Based on hydrological characteristics, integrated thematic maps reveal that of basin area falls under very good, under good, under moderate, and under poor zones for groundwater potential. From the sub-basin-wise prioritisation, it has been inferred that SB-III scored highest groundwater potential, followed by SB-X. Result of morphometric analyses with the hydrologic parameters indicates that area of SB-III and SB-X are under very good to moderate groundwater potential zone. This study clearly demonstrates that hydrological parameters in relation with morphometric analyses are useful to demarcate the prospect zones of groundwater.\\'Arthrosphaeridae) in Southern India\\'Abstract: \\'The endemic giant pill-millipedes belonging to the genus Arthrosphaera has a long history of occurrence and distribution in the Indian Subcontinent. According to the earlier and recent records, up to 40 species of Arthrosphaera are confined to southern India and Sri Lanka. Being detritus feeders, they are sensitive to narrow range of abiotic factors and their population is dwindling due to severe human interference especially landscape modification or modern forestry/agricultural practices. There is an urgent need to update the status, occurrence and distribution in distinct ecological conditions of pill-millipedes in southern India as they are important component in organic matter decomposition as well as nutrient turn over in the forests or plantations. Based on recent surveys, the present study attempts to update occurrence, distribution and morphological description (light and scanning electron microscopy) with a diagnostic key for identification of 11 species of pill-millipedes occurring in the Western Ghats of India with commentary on their distribution pattern in different ecological conditions and impact of edaphic factors.\\'Abstract: \\'Diversity of life is unevenly distributed over the surface of the earth; especially rich are the tropics, mountainous regions and island archipelagos.

The orchards differed in fertility of clones as well as flower and fruit production per ramet. Fertility was highly skewed in CSO-II, where one clone (originating from higher latitude N, in Eastern Ghats of peninsular India) produced 55% of the fruits and 68% of the flowers in the orchard, in contrast to a similar contribution from four most fertile clones in CSO-I. Fertility variation, measured as `sibling coefficient\\' (1.7 in CSO-I and 8.3 in CSO-II), was high in CSO-II resulting in high coancestry and low effective population size (3 times lower than CSO-I) in the seed crop. In CSO-I, 58% of the clones contributed effectively to seed production compared to only 12% effective contribution resulting in eight times higher genetic drift in CSO-II. Placing limits on how much seed can be collected per clone might be useful in restricting over representation of highly reproductive clones thereby increasing genetic diversity in the seed crop.\"Abstract: \\'A study was carried out examining the effects of conservation policy on the ecosystem and livelihoods of local people on the Rajiv Gandhi National Park, located in one of the global biodiversity hotspots, the Western Ghats, India. Results show that less than 5% of the people are in favor of the policies while a staggering 94% of the people are strongly against the policies. The remaining 1% of the total respondents are found neutral with regard to conservation policies. Several reasons viz., ban on agriculture, restriction on livestock rearing and grazing, ban on non-timber forest collection, exclusion of local and indigenous communities in conservation programs and tourism activities are found to be responsible for negative attitude towards the national park. Apart from limiting the local livelihood options, the anticipated ecological consequences are not encouraging as exotic species are dominating the vegetation dynamics of the many native plant species. The fact is that the inextricable link between nature and society needs an integrated science-policy research approach for biodiversity conservation in the hotspots, particularly in the developing countries where human and ecosystem interactions are much more complex and closely interwoven with each other.\\'Abstract: \\'The Indian gene centre possesses a rich legume species comprising cultivated, underutilized edible and forage legumes. Majority of the underutilized food legumes are widely distributed as wild species in various agro-ecological regions of peninsular India. Indian legume species (62%) contribute to the food and health security of ethnic communities. A total of 66,546 accessions of legume gene resources including underutilized species are conserved in the National Gene Bank. Collection, characterization and conservation efforts regarding the diversity of these beans are described. The importance of genetic variation in legumes and their wild relatives as a source of desirable resistance to pests and diseases in a changing climate scenario is discussed. Information on legumes used in Indian and modern systems of medicine and ethno-botany as well as the scope for bio-prospecting are presented. Advanced biotechnological applications in legume research for sustainable utilization of these resources are highlighted. An integrated gene resource management strategy to combat malnutrition, identify gene resources for legume improvement and enhance their value as traditional food and medicine is described.\\'Abstract: \\'Axillary shoots were induced from shoot tip of Calamus thwaitesii suckers on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 0.4 mg/L N6-benzylaminopurine and 0.1 mg/L each of thidiazuron and acid (NAA). The shoots initiated were subcultured to fresh media of the same composition for shoot multiplication and multiplied shoots were transferred to half strength MS hormone-free media for shoot elongation. The elongated shoots were then re-cultured to the media supplemented with 3.0 mg/L indole-3-butyric acid/4.0 mg/L NAA to raise plantlets which were subsequently analysed for genetic fidelity using inter simple sequence repeat markers. Out of 183 bands scored, 178 bands were monomorphic indicating 97.2% similarity. The observed low level of polymorphism between genotypes supports genetic consistency of these micro-clones that are likely to be genetically true to their parental origin. The clones thus obtained were hardened in the specially fabricated mist house at 29 and relative humidity for 3 months followed by shifting to green house for another 3 months of nursery establishment. The established plants when reintroduced to the selected forest segments of the Western Ghats, Kerala (India) showed 79.3% survival rate after 2 years of field transfer. The viable and highly reproducible in vitro cloning protocol demonstrated here for the first time can be used for the production of elite female clones for aforestation activities and sustained delivery of high quality raw materials to cane processing units for strengthening cane industry.\\'Abstract: \\'Liana diversity was inventoried in four tropical dry evergreen forest sites that are characterized by numerous trees, of short stature and small diameter, and a varying degree of anthropogenic disturbance, on the Coromandel coast of south India. A 1-ha plot was established in each of the four sites and was subdivided into 100 quadrats of 10 10 m. All lianas cm diameter at breast height (dbh) rooted within the plot were enumerated. The species richness and density of lianas, with respect to site disturbance and forest stature, varied across the sites. Liana density totaled 3307 individuals (range individuals and species richness totaled 39 species (range species representing 34 genera and 24 families. Combretaceae, Asclepiadaceae, Capparaceae and Vitaceae were the well-represented families. The top five species Strychnos minor, Combretum albidum, Derris ovalifolia, Jasminum angustifolium and Reissantia indica contributed 55% of total density. The slopes of the curves were different for each of the four sites and the curve stabilized in only one site. Of the four climbing modes recognized among the total 39 species, 18 were twiners (56% of the total density). Eight species (24% of density) were tendril climbers and 12 species (16% of density) were scramblers. Hugonia mystax was the only hook climber. All the 39 species and 88% of liana density were encountered within a category of 6 cm dbh or less, and a similar pattern prevailed in the individual sites. Of the three diaspore dispersal modes found among the 39 liana species, animal (64%) and wind (23%) dispersal were predominant over the autochorous mode (13%). Liana diversity and distribution in dry forest communities appear to be influenced by forest stature and site disturbance levels. In the light of the extent of liana diversity and sacred grove status of the study sites, the need for forest conservation, involving local people, is emphasized.\\'Abstract: \\'This review deals with the forest vegetation of the Himalaya with emphasis on: paleoecological, phytogeographical, and phytosociological aspects of vegetation; structural and functional features of forest ecosystem; and relationship between man and forests.\\'Abstract: \\'1. Aze A, Zhou JC, Costa A, Costanzo V (2013) DNA replication and homologous recombination factors: acting together to maintain genome stabilityChromosoma122 duplication requires the coordinated action of multiple proteins to ensure a fast replication with high fidelity. These factors form a complex called the Replisome, which is assembled onto the DNA duplex to promote its unwinding and to catalyze the polymerization of two new strands. Key constituents of the Replisome are the Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS helicase and the And1-Claspin-Tipin-Tim1 complex, which coordinate DNA unwinding with polymerase alpha-, delta-, and epsilon- dependent DNA polymerization. These factors encounter numerous obstacles, such as endogenous DNA lesions leading to template breakage and complex structures arising from intrinsic features of specific DNA sequences. To overcome these roadblocks, homologous recombination DNA repair factors, such as Rad51 and the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex, are required to...\\'Abstract: \\'Microsatellite loci are widely used in population and conservation genetic studies of amphibians, but the availability of such markers for tropical and subtropical taxa is currently very limited. In order to develop resources for conservation genetic studies in the genus Indirana, we tested amplification success and polymorphism in 62 previously developed microsatellite loci, in eight Indirana species - including new candidate species. Developing genomic resources for this amphibian taxon is particularly important as it is endemic to the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, and harbours several endangered species.\\'Abstract: \\'The Western Ghats of Kerala have been settled over the past 40 years by landless immigrants. Natural forests and cardamom (planted under forest canopy) have been widely replaced by small-holder cultivation. Settlers plant cassava and other annuals in the initial years following clearing of the forest canopy. These crops are gradually replaced by black pepper, the dominant crop years after clearing. Finally, other perennial crops, planted during the period when pepper was dominant, mature. A highly mixed cropping phase is most common on sites years after the forest canopy was removed. Soil erosion on sites cleared years previously averaged 120 t/ha in the 1988 monsoon season. Over the same period, soil erosion under mature cardamom, pepper and mixed cultivation averaged 0.65, 3.5, and 1.45 t/ha respectively. Erosion levels appear to be related to cover at ground and intermediate m) heights above the surface. Soil organic matter is high in the cardamom areas, declines rapidly when the forest canopy is cleared, remains low in pepper, and appears to rebuild to levels as more mixed agroforestry systems become established. Overall, there appears to be a succession in which high erosion and declining organic matter levels are temporary features associated with the conversion of sites from forests and cardamom to other phases.\\'Abstract: \"People\\'s participation is usually regarded as a sine qua non for the success and sustainability of development projects. Yet in practice, it raises a number of questions. Who are the Why is their participation sought, and how or at what level, is such participation desired? This paper seeks to examine the rhetoric of participation in the implementation of the Ganga Action Plan (GAP) at Varanasi, in the north-eastern State of Uttar Pradesh, India. Launched in 1985, the GAP is the first major attempt to systematically control and monitor the pollution of a significant river in the country. In addition, it claimed to be a because of the powerful and deep-seated cultural and religious meaning associated with the Ganga. Varanasi, however, is indicative of its failure to deliver this promise the GAP is only acceptable to authority because it does not challenge the existing institutional order, and its participatory content is symbolic rather than substantive. Non-govemental organisations, traditionally viewed as intermediary actors between the micro and macro levels, work within the socio-political framework of the city.

In spite of such efforts, forest fragmentation and degradation continues, with forests being subject to increased pressure due to anthropogenic factors. Such fragmentation and degradation is leading to the forest cover to change from very dense to moderately dense and open forest and of very dense forest has been converted to moderately dense forest, open forest, scrub and non-forest (during Similarly, there has been a degradation of of moderately dense forest to open forest, scrub and non-forest resulting in a net loss of of moderately dense forest. Additionally, of open forest have degraded to scrub and non-forest. Coupled with pressure due to anthropogenic factors, climate change is likely to be an added stress on forests. Forest sector programs and policies are major factors that determine the status of forests and potentially resilience to projected impacts of climate change. An attempt is made to review the forest policies and programs and their implications for the status of forests and for vulnerability of forests to projected climate change. The study concludes that forest conservation and development policies and programs need to be oriented to incorporate climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation.\\'Abstract: \\'An overview of the problem of orographic effects on the southwest monsoon using the contributions of all the available analytical and numerical models is attempted. A quasi-geostrophic model is applied to deduce the effect of the topographic complex on the Indian peninsula. This model suggests that the southward bending of the low-level isobars on the peninsula can be ascribed to the topographically-induced southward velocity. This southward velocity triggers a Rossby wave to the east of the peninsula which is manifested as a trough on the southern Bay of Bengal.\\'Abstract: \\'Natural vegetation on the south-eastern coast of Peninsular India has now been reduced to patches, some of which are preserved as sacred groves. The plant biodiversity and population structure of woody plants (>20 cm girth at breast height; gbh) in two such groves, Oorani and Olagapuram, occurring on the north-west of Pondicherry have been analyzed. A total of 169 angiosperms have been enumerated from both sites. The Oorani grove (3.2 ha) had 74 flowering plant species distributed in 71 genera and 41 families; 30 of them are woody species, 8 are lianas and 4 are parasites. The Olagapuram grove (2.8 ha) was more species-rich with 136 species in 121 genera of 58 families; woody species were fewer (21) while 9 lianas and 3 parasites occurred. The vegetation structure indicates that the Oorani grove is a relic of tropical dry evergreen forest, whereas Olagapuram is reduced to a thorny woodland. The latter is heavily degraded as it has lost the status of a sacred grove because of its conversion to Eucalyptus plantations. The Oorani grove has an Amman temple in the centre. The attendant cultural rites and religious rituals have perpetuated the status of a sacred grove which has ensured the protection of the grove.\\'Abstract: \\'India is known for its rich heritage of biodiversity. In biological diversity parlance, India is one of the 17 mega-diverse countries in the world. With only of the area, India accounts for of the recorded plant and animal species. ten biogeographic zones possess an exemplary diversity of ecological habitats like alpine forests, grasslands, wetlands, coastal and marine ecosystems, and desert ecosystems. The large mosaic of distinct agro-ecosystems has contributed to diverse cropping pattern and systems across the country. Amongst the existing biota, 91,307 species of animals of which 2,557 Protista, 12,470 general invertebrates, 69,903 arthropods, 4,994 vertebrates, and 45,500 species of plants as well as 5,650 microbial species have been documented in its 10 bio-geographic regions. India has four out of thirty-four global biodiversity hotspots, which is an indicator of high degree of endemism (of species) in India. About 5,150 plant species and 1,837 animal species are endemic to India. biodiversity includes wild relatives of agricultural crops and domesticated animals. India has 16 major types and 251 subtypes of forests. Indigenous medicine systems utilize nearly 6,500 native plants for both human and animal healthcare. diverse preponderance of native tribal and ethnic groups has contributed significantly in the conservation and diversification of biodiversity. Its cultural and ethnic diversity includes over 550 tribal communities of 227 ethnic groups spread over 5,000 forested villages. India proudly upholds the tradition of nature conservation. In 252 B.C., the Emperor Asoka established protected areas (PAs) for mammals, birds, fish and forests through a proclamation. Jim Corbett National Park covering an area of came into being as the first and third National Park in 1936. India has currently of total geographic area under an elaborate network of PAs, which includes 99 National Parks, 513 wildlife sanctuaries, 43 conservation reserves, 4 community reserves and 3 biodiversity heritage sites. India has a National Wildlife Action Plan, which envisages of the geographical area of the country under PA coverage. In India, the accelerated loss of biodiversity components over the last few decades has been of great concern. Environmental changes, overexploitation and habitat loss are among the major causes of species loss that, according to certain estimates, is of the order of a species per day. The richness of biological resources and related indigenous knowledge is an asset that needs to be cherished, conserved and judiciously utilized. One of the major challenges before the country lies in adopting a system which helps in utilizing this biodiversity for benefit of humankind without compromising on risking the loss. The intrinsic value of biological diversity and of the ecological, genetic, social, economic, scientific, educational, cultural, recreational and aesthetic values and its components are to be taken care properly for the better management of biological resources and biodiversity for the welfare of human beings for better, and healthier as well as peaceful living on earth. The conservation of biological diversity is a serious and common concern of human beings for better living. The general lack of information and knowledge regarding biological diversity and of the urgent need to develop scientific, technical and institutional capacities to provide the basic understanding is important to plan and implement appropriate measures. It should be recognized that the women in rural play a vital role in the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and affirming the need for the full participation of women at all levels of policy making and implementation for biological diversity conservation. Biodiversity is an important component for economic and social development and poverty eradication and overriding priorities of most of the developing countries in the world. The conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity is critical importance of meeting of food, fodder, fiber, health, water and other needs of growing world population for which purpose, access to and sharing of both genetic resources and technologies are essential. It should be determined to conserve and sustainable use of biological diversity for the benefit of present and future generations.\\'Abstract: \\'This paper provides a suitable framework for consolidating knowledge and providing a useful starting point to undertake conservation of the last remnants of Butea monosperma forest. A survey was conducted to assess the status of a reportedly unexplored B. monosperma forest in a narrow strip of land along the northeastern region of Pakistan in order to conserve the remaining remnants. A preliminary reconnaissance survey on the basis of land use divides the narrow stretch of land, with concentration of remnants into four zones. The remnants were further evaluated for in situ conservation by a scoring system based on vegetation analysis and quality of habitat. Low value was assigned to those criteria which had negative impact and high to those which had positive impact on performance of B. monosperma and its long-term survival. Additional information, pertaining to decline, trends of change in the land use, and the underlying socioeconomic processes, was also made. Information from the study area indicated that, in the past two decades, the decline and conversion of the remaining B. monosperma forest to agriculture and forestry has been intensified. The vegetation analysis revealed that all remnants are broadly B. vasica, bispecies association. The scoring system ranked the remnants into four classes. Two forests from the intact remnant class and one from the mildly degraded class were recommended for in situ conservation. Keeping in view the deteriorating status of the highly ranked remnants across the landscape and the degree of alteration it is undergoing, they were assigned the conservation status category of An approach suggested for their immediate conservation was to fence them, with open access to the local people for sustainable resource use. In situ conservation of these benchmarks would help in further understanding the ecological, evolutionary, and structural features of this unique biogeographic ecotone and its affinities with the adjacent ecosystems.\\'Abstract: \\'Biodiversity of woody species was investigated in Ialong and Raliangsacred groves of the Jaintia hills in Meghalaya, northeast India.

Exploitation of the tubers and poor regeneration from seed has narrowed distribution and propagation of the species. There is a need to develop in vitro propagation methods for C. karulensis to alleviate these problems. Here, we optimized callus induction, somatic embryogenesis and microtuberization from different seedling explants viz. cotyledonary leaf and root. The environmental scanning electron microscopy was used to observe somatic embryonic origin and their developmental stages. Highest callus proliferation was recorded with 6-benzylaminopurine and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Somatic embryos derived from cotyledonary leaf explants were more proliferative than root explants. The combination of 6-benzylaminopurine, naphthalene acetic acid and 7% sucrose in MS media resulted in highest microtuberization. Further, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based metabolic profiling was carried out from native wild plants and in vitro callus tissues which identified various phytochemicals such as alkaloids, fatty acids, esters alcohols, etc. Multivariate analysis revealed the chemical disparities, where considerable variations were observed between native wild type and in vitro tissues, but no significant differences were found among in vitro callus from both root and cotyledonary explants. Overall, our results suggested that the production of various secondary metabolites found in C. karulensis was not affected by in vitro propagation and could be utilized in the conservation strategies for this plant.\\'Abstract: \\'The Myristicaceae family is a primitive angiosperm family and is characterized by species that are highly endemic to the Western Ghats area of India.

Often sites have people living within or nearby who speak different languages, many of which are unique and similarly endangered. Here we examine the co-occurrence of Natural WHSs with languages, as a key index of cultural diversity, to identify locations for integrative conservation opportunities aimed at protecting human and non-human diversity. Our analysis reveals many WHSs with high linguistic diversity, as well as endangered sites with associated indigenous languages and endangered languages that intersect Natural WHSs. Results identify Australia as the continent which has the greatest number of Natural WHSs, many co-occurring with highly endangered languages. Engaging speakers of indigenous languages often can help maintain nature, while efforts to conserve Natural WHSs can help preserve settings that enabled indigenous languages and cultures to emerge and persist.\\'Abstract: \\'Natural landscapes include more than the physical elements that are typically measured and assessed. Many current sites for studies of biological diversity have long supported human history in various ways, including spiritually. As some studies explicitly query human-environment interactions, ecological research focused outside of these interactions must come to terms with people living and depending on natural resources on the landscape. Religious values promise a beneficial meeting point of human interests and natural resource conservation, where both conservationists and local communities may find similar goals.\\'Abstract: \\'Panna National Park is situated in the north-central part of Madhya Pradesh, India. Landscape parameters like fragmentation, porosity, patchiness and jaxtaposition have been analysed for disturbance gradient characterization. Disturbance on biodiversity due to human activities has been studied both qualitatively and quantitatively. The species richness is highest in northern mixed dry deciduous forest followed by dry deciduous open scrub and southern tropical dry deciduous teak forest. Species richness of the open thorny dry deciduous forest with grasses is found to be the lowest. Disturbance analysis indicates that 22.02% of the southern slightly moist teak forests are highly disturbed whereas Anogeissus forest and Riverine forest have 17.04% and 12.41% of the area under high disturbance, respectively. A total of 88 field sample plots were laid to enumerate trees, shrubs, herbs, climbers, etc. Biological richness parameters such as Shannon-Wiener biodiversity index, biodiversity value, ecosystem uniqueness were derived from field data. High biological richness is found in northern mixed dry deciduous forest and mixed dry deciduous forest with bamboo. More than 99% of such areas are falling under medium to high biological richness. Nearly 55% of the gentle and flat to gentle, slope categories were found to have low biological richness.\\'Abstract: \\'The freshwater resources of India are currently experiencing an alarming decline in fish biodiversity due to several factors and as a result, a sizeable portion of fresh water fishes have been categorized as threatened. This emphasizes an immediate need for initiating research and actions for alternative management techniques to protect these aquatic systems. One such option that has potential to protect freshwater ecosystem from numerous threats is the creation of freshwater aquatic sanctuary (FAS) within protected area network. Though similar conservation practices are well established in the terrestrial and marine ecosystem, however, the work on freshwater systems has been very slow and negligible. In the present communication we conceptualized the need and approach for developing FAS within the protected area network based on our observations in the water bodies of the selected wildlife sanctuaries in Northern India as well as success stories of some other countries. In this study we assessed the fish diversity in the selected protected areas of Northern India. The assessment indicated that these sanctuaries harbor of freshwater fishes, which are threatened in other areas. Apart from Indian Major Carps, Tor putitora, Chitala chitala, Pangasius pangasius, Clupisoma gerua, Ailia coila, Aorichthys aor, Wallago attu, Rhinomugil corsula, Ompok pabda, Ombok pabo etc. were the important species encountered in the protected waters. The various issues related to FAS including objectives, approach, potential tools, implementation and management are discussed towards saving endangered fish germplasm resources. Approaches, tools and modus operandi proposed in this communication could be utilized by other developing countries in the region.\\'Abstract: \\'An efficient system was developed for direct plant regeneration from in vitro-derived leaf explants of Embelia ribes Burm. f., a vulnerable medicinal woody climber of the Western Ghats of India. The in vitro procedure involved three steps that included induction of shoot initials from leaf tissue, regeneration and elongation of shoots from the shoot initials, and rooting of shoots. The induction of shoot initials was achieved on Murashige and Skoog (MS) solid medium supplemented with different concentrations of thidiazuron (TDZ). The best medium for shoot induction was MS with TDZ. Numerous shoot primordia developed within weeks on the leaf margin as well as on the midrib region, without any callus phase. In the second step, the shoot clumps separated from the leaf explant on transfer to MS basal medium, resulting in the differentiation of 90% of the shoot initials into well-developed shoots. The 2- to 3-cm-long shoots rooted on half-strength MS basal medium supplemented with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and 3% (w/v) sucrose in the third stage. The rooted plants could be established in soil with 70% success. This protocol could be utilized for in vitro propagation and conservation of this important threatened medicinal plant.\\'Abstract: \\'Physical and ecological factors such as season, rainfall, food availability, number of plant species eaten, intergroup encounters, and degree of terrestriality influence the daily path length (DPL) and home range use of animals. We examined whether these factors influenced DPL and home range use in a group of endemic lion-tailed macaques (Macaca silenus) in the selectively logged forests of Sirsi-Honnavara in the central Western Ghats Mountains of south India. We predicted that monthly rainfall, fruit tree density, number of plant species eaten, intergroup encounters, and terrestriality would correlate with DPL, and fruit tree density, overall tree density, and richness of fruiting tree species would correlate with home range use. We collected data on feeding ecology from scan sampling, and DPL and home range use by recording the geo-coordinates of the focal group with a handheld GPS during daily follows. We obtained 1230 h of observations over 24 mo between 2008 and 2011. We collected data on the density of food species and of all trees using the point-centered quarter method in 1-ha grid cells overlaid on the home range of the study group. Results showed that the mean monthly DPL correlated positively with the number of trees fruiting in a month and negatively with rainfall. Overall tree density and fruit tree density correlated positively with habitat use. These findings support the hypothesis that primary food resources are a major determinant of primate ranging patterns. Our results are also important for lion-tailed macaque conservation, in light of the pressure the habitat has been facing. We propose conservation action to include the important food species of lion-tailed macaques for habitat restoration by the local forest department.\\'Abstract: \\'We assessed the population status of endangered lion-tailed macaques (Macaca silenus) in the rain forests of Kudremukh Forest complex (Kudremukh National Park, Someshwara Wildlife Sanctuary and Mookambika Wildlife Sanctuary), Western Ghats, Karnataka in January 2007. We performed a census of 20 groups in Kudremukh NP, 4 groups in Someshwara WS, and 6 groups in Mookambika WS. We estimated the population size as ca. 451 individuals in the 3 parks. The forests of Kudremukh NP and Someshwara WS are continuous, and the present finding of 24 groups in a single continuous forest confirms the existence of another significant population of lion-tailed macaques.\\'Abstract: \\'Consumption and processing of allochthonous plant litter by fishes is more common in tropical than temperate streams and rivers. Therefore, aquatic hyphomycetes in water (filtration), leaf litter (bubble chamber incubation), and fecal pellets (direct observation and inoculation to sterile leaf litter) of three dominant fishes belonging to the family Cyprinidae (Aplocheilus lineatus, Puntius filamentosus, and Rasbora daniconius) in two locations of the River Kali of the Western Ghats, India, were evaluated during postmonsoon season. Spores of 14 and 9 species of aquatic hyphomycetes were recovered on filtering water samples of Kaiga stream and Kadra dam with equal number of spores (32 spores 100 and high Shannon diversity in Kaiga stream. In a bubble chamber incubation of leaf litter, 16 and 9 species were recovered from Kaiga stream and Kadra dam with high spore output (1122 versus 324 spores per mg dry mass) and high Shannon diversity in Kaiga stream. Both direct and indirect methods of examination of fecal pellets of fishes revealed more species in Kaiga stream than Kadra dam versus species). The spore release in leaf litter incubated with fecal pellets ranged from 2.3 to 98 with the highest Aplocheilus lineatus in Kaiga stream; while in Kadra dam, it was from 0.02 to 22.9 with the highest in Puntius filamentosus. The Shannon diversity of aquatic hyphomycetes was high in fecal pellets of Aplocheilus lineatus of Kaiga stream and Rasbora daniconius of Kadra dam. The top-ranked five species of aquatic hyphomycetes differed in water, leaf litter, and fish fecal pellets; however, Triscelophorus konajensis was common for all. All five top-ranked species of aquatic hyphomycetes in feces produced multicelled spores; thus, they were likely to have a better chance of viability through gut passage than single-celled spores. Preferential feeding, fungi in gut and feces, and survival and dissemination of spores by invertebrates and fishes with reference to aquatic hyphomycetes were discussed.\\'Abstract: \\'The principles and methods of the vegetation mapping undertaken at the French Institute, Pondicherry, are dealt with herein. Particularly, the characterisation of the different types of vegetation and especially the originality of the method: the dynamic interpretation of the vegetation and the depiction of the bioclimatic conditions. The programme of the forest map of South India at scale 1:250 000, undertaken in collaboration with the forest departments of the concerned states, is then described with special attention given to the source and the collection of data. This map has been conceived to serve as a basic document for the sustainable management of the forests. Three examples of its application are given. They concern the detection of anomalies between the existing forest cover and the prevalent climatic environment; the detection of areas for which protection is urgently needed; the selection of regions showing a particular interest in the field of nature conservation or as gene pool reserve. Finally, an example of a thematic map of sensibility of the forests is given, using the vegetation map as a basis.\\'Abstract: \\'By incorporating data from unofficial, non-reporting raingauge stations a list of 17 locations with an average annual rainfall exceeding 5000 mm can be compiled for Peninsular India. All stations are located along the westward exposed escarpment of the Western Ghats at a distance of not more than 100 km from the Arabian Sea. Here the superimposition of large-scale dynamic and static, location during the Southwest Monsoon period results in annual, monthly and daily rainfall amounts that are only surpassed at a few stations outside the peninsula in Northeast India. Potentials and problems of water resources development in the heavy rainfall areas are briefly discussed.\\'Abstract: \\'The relationship and its key predictors in Indian tropical archipelagos are understudied. East of the Indian mainland (the Eastern coast, EC) are the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (AN, about away at the shortest distance), which exhibit a great plant diversity, with 848 unique species. West of the Indian mainland (the Western Ghats, WG) are another group of islands, the Lakshadweep Islands (LD, about away at the shortest distance), which exhibit less diversity (102 unique species) than do the AN. We compared these two pairs which exhibit different insular isolation conditions, to understand the plant dispersal mechanisms and their determining predictors (plant richness, geographic area, perimeter, elevation, and shortest distance). We found epizoochory (adherence to an animal surface), ornithochory (birds), and hydrochory (water) to be the dominant dispersers of both the pairs. Additionally, the plant dispersal in the pair is predominantly driven by anemochory (wind), possibly denoting the effects of the northeasterly trade winds. The major role of biotic dispersers in the pair may be explained as resulting from plant dispersal to more remote islands through biotic dispersers being more rapid and efficient. The plant commonality was found to be positively correlated with the plant richness, geographic area, and perimeter; whereas it was negatively correlated with the shortest distance and elevation of the selected pairs. Both linear and non-linear regression with maximum accuracy found island plant richness, geographic area, and shortest distance to the nearest mainland pool to be the determinants in explaining plant-dispersal mechanisms. These predictors are important to maintain the habitat suitability and connectivity and thereby support more newly dispersed plants. The relationship (epizoochory, ornithochory, anemochory, and hydrochory) and the key predictors (plant richness, geographic area, and shortest distance) found in this study could be useful for conservation, planning, and monitoring of biodiversity.\\'Abstract: \\'Historically the temple forests in India have served many spiritual and religious purposes. This paper stresses on the use of the underused repertoire of sacred acts to integrate the benefits of temple forests in rural development. The tree/plant species, planting design and the rituals related to their worship documented in the great epics, vedas and upanishads are of great value especially in the context of promoting forest development and the forest development led agricultural development. The Star, Planet and Zodiac forests contain a large number of native tree species ideally suited to tropical stress and drought. The promotion of temple forests would help developing forests in the upstream areas which can help create climax forests and aid in soil and moisture conservation to help improve the productivity of downstream agriculture. As the chief utilitarian value of these temple trees and plants is in terms of the native (ayurvedic) medicine, their propagation would not only develop the downsteam farming opportunities, but also promote the native medicine sector.\\'Abstract: \\'Seven accessions of the underutilized legume, Cassia hirsuta L., seeds collected from seven different agroclimatic regions of Tamil Nadu, India, were analyzed for proximate composition, total proteins, protein fractions, mineral profiles and selected antinutritional factors. Crude protein ranged from 15.52 to 20.74%, crude lipid crude ash and carbohydrates Energyvalues of the seeds were kJ/100 g (DM), which are comparable to those of other legumes. Data on seed protein fractions revealed thatglobulins constituted the bulk of the seed protein as in most legumes. Mineralcontents of the seeds showed greater variation. Potassium was the mostabundant mineral mg/100 g), whereas manganese was low mg/100 g). Antinutritional factors such as total free phenolics,tannins, L-DOPA and lectins were analyzed. The results of the studydemonstrated that the accessions of C. hirsuta seeds collectedfrom Tamil Nadu, India, could be good sources of some important nutrientsfor humans.\\'Abstract: \\'Tropical and subtropical Asia differs from other tropical regions in its monsoonal climate and the dominant influence of the Hindukush and Himalayan mountain ranges which result in extremes of spatial and temporal variability in precipitation. However, several major rivers and their tributaries arise in the Himalayan ranges and are fed by thousands of glaciers. Huge sediment loads carried by these rivers result in important deltas at their mouths. The climatic and physiographic diversity have endowed the region with many kinds of wetlands. Of these, the peatswamps of southeast Asia constitute about 56% of the tropical peatlands, and more than 42% of the mangroves occur in South and southeast Asia. Among other wetlands, riverine swamps are rather restricted whereas the seasonal marshes are a dominant feature. Another characteristic feature of tropical Asia are the innumerable human-made and intensively managed wetlands of which the paddy fields and aquaculture ponds are the most extensive. Throughout tropical Asia, wetlands have been a part of the socio-cultural ethos of the people and many communities have lived in wetlands. However, the pressures of high population and the economic development have extensively impacted upon wetlands which have been transformed for paddy cultivation and aquaculture, drained and converted to other land uses for economic gains (e.g., conversion to oil palm), and degraded by discharge of domestic and industrial wastes. Invasive plant and animal species have also played a significant role. The climate change is already being felt in the rapid retreat of Himalayan glaciers, increased temperature and variability in precipitation as well as the frequency of extreme events. Sea level rise is seen as a major threat to the coastal wetlands, particularly the mangroves. Increasing droughts have caused frequent fires in Indonesian peat swamps that have further feedback impacts on regional climate. However, the actual threat to wetlands in this region arises from the extensive hydrological alterations being caused by storage, abstraction and diversion of river flows for agriculture, industry and hydropower. Currently, the state of our understanding wetlands in general, and the efforts and infrastructure for research and training in wetlands are very poor. Although a few wetlands have been designated as Ramsar sites, the policies aimed at wetland conservation are either non-existent or very weak. Human responses to greater uncertainty and variability in the available water resources in different parts of Asia will be crucial to the conservation of wetlands in the future.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availablesouthern India\\'Abstract: \\'With growing human and, possibly, elephant populations and a drastic increase in anthropogenic activities, conflict in Asia has been on the rise. The Alur area in Karnataka state, southern India, is one such case in point, which has witnessed increasing levels of conflict over the last two decades. The tiny, moderately protected habitat available for elephants in this human-dominated landscape does not appear to be able to support elephants over the long term. Options to deal with the escalating conflict include translocation of elephants, bringing elephants into captivity, and culling. We carried out a molecular genetic study of elephants in the Alur area to estimate the minimum number of elephants using the area, the sex ratio, genetic relatedness between individuals, and genetic structure with regard to the larger population in the landscape, so that informed management decisions could be made. Fresh dung samples were collected from the field and genotyped using 12 microsatellite loci. We found 29 unique individuals in the population, comprising 17 females and 12 males of different age classes. Relatedness between females suggested independent colonisations by discrete, small groups rather than by one cohesive clan of related females. This obviates the need for a single solution for dealing with all the females in the area in order to maintain social integrity, and has implications in terms how these elephants can be dealt with. We demonstrate how social organization inferred through molecular data from non-invasive sampling can inform management decisions.\\'Abstract: \\'Extensive surveys were conducted to explore the diversity of fishes, distribution patterns, abundance, threat, and habitat status in the upper, middle, and lower stretch of river Gomti, a tributary of river Ganga. Altogether 56 fish species belonging to 20 families and 42 genera were collected from various sampling sites. Of the 56 species, five belong to the (EN) category and 11 belong to the vulnerable (VU) category. Six major categories of habitat were identified and pattern of fish assemblage and dominant genera in each habitat studied. Considerable differences were observed in the fish species richness and relative abundance (RA) of the species in the different sampling sites of river Gomti. biodiversity index has been calculated for the fishes indicating considerable variation across the river. Apart from Indian Major Carps (Labeo rohita, Catla catla, Cirrhinus mrigala), Chitala chitala, Notopterus notopterus, Ompok pabda, O. bimaculatus, Labeo bata, L. calbasu, Cirrhinus reba, Channa marulius, Bagarius bagarius, and Clupisoma garua were the important species. All the species have been reported for the first time in this river. Indiscriminate catch, poisoning, using of fine mesh sized nets, dumping of sewage, siltation, water abstraction, changing land use pattern, decreased water discharge, and exotic species threaten the fish diversity. Urgent need exists for taking up research on the priority fish species and their habitat. Restoration measures have been proposed based on ecosystem scale approach for fish biodiversity conservation.\\'Abstract: \\'The Oriental fruit bat genus Cynopterus, with several geographically overlapping species, presents an interesting case study to evaluate the evolutionary significance of coexistence versus isolation. We examined the morphological and genetic variability of congeneric fruit bats Cynopterus sphinx and C. brachyotis using 405 samples from two natural contact zones and 17 allopatric locations in the Indian subcontinent; and investigated the population differentiation patterns, evolutionary history, and the possibility of cryptic diversity in this species pair.\\'Abstract: \\'Logging and forest loss continues to be a major problem within Southeast Asia and as a result, many species are becoming threatened or extinct. The present study provides the first detailed and comprehensive ecological data on the Siberut macaque (Macaca siberu), a primate species living exclusively on the island of Siberut off the west coast of Sumatra. Our results show that M. siberu is ecologically similar to its closest relative M. nemestrina occurring on the mainland, both species being semi-terrestrial, mainly frugivorous (75-76%), exhibit a large daily travel distance for their group size and spend more time on traveling than any other macaque species. The habitat of Siberut macaques was floristically very diverse index D=0.97), although somewhat impoverished in tree species richness, and had a lower tree basal area and a lower rattan density compared to other forests in Malesia (both rattan and palm tree fruit being an important food resource for Macaca siberu due to their long fruiting periods). These factors may lead to a lower diversity and abundance of fruit resources, and coupled with a high degree of frugivory of Siberut macaques, may explain the large amount of traveling observed in this species. The large home range requirements and strong dependence on fruit are important factors that need to be considered when developing conservation measures for this IUCN-listed (Category Vulnerable) species.\\'and species composition\\'Abstract: \\'Sustainable extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has recently gained considerable attention as a means to enhance rural incomes and conserve tropical forests. However, there is little information on the amounts of products collected per unit area and the impact of extraction on forest structure and composition. In this paper we estimate the quantities of selected products gathered by the Soligas, the indigenous people in the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) sanctuary in Karnataka, India, and examine the effect of extraction on forest structure and composition. Two sites, distant (DS) and proximal (PS), were identified based on the proximity to a Soliga settlement. The frequency of different size classes indicates that regeneration overall is poor in the area. The two sites show differences in species richness, basal area, and tree mortality. Furthermore, non-timber forest product species show a greater deficit of small size classes than the timber forest species, suggesting that regeneration is affected by collection of seeds and fruits from non-timber forest product species. Regeneration, however, may also be affected by other anthropogenic pressures such as fire, grazing and competition with weeds.\\'Abstract: \\'\\'Abstract: \\'In the present study, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method namely inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) was employed to assess genetic stability in tissue culture-derived Dictyospermum ovalifolium plantlets. To study genomic stability of micropropagated plants, 14 individuals were randomly tagged among a population of 2500 regenerants and were compared with single donor mother plant. A total of 51 clear and reproducible bands ranging from 200 bp to 2.1 kb were scored corresponding to an average of 3.64 bands per primer. Two of the 51 bands were polymorphic (3.92 %) among 14 individuals, thus indicating the occurrence of low level genomic variation in the micropropagated plants. Cluster analysis indicates that genetic similarity values were 0.978 which allows classification of the plants to distinct groups. Further an attempt was made to reintroduce the micropropagated plants into their natural habitat. Over one thousand six hundred fifty plants were successfully established.\\'Abstract: \\'Freshwater ecosystems and associated habitats harbor incredible biodiversity. They offer various ecosystem services and sustain human livelihoods. However, due to increasing developmental pressure and rising water demand, these systems are under huge threat. As a result, many aquatic species are feared to become extinct in near future. Quantifying the patterns of aquatic species diversity and composition of river systems is urgently required. With this interest, we studied four river systems in the Western Ghats region, documenting the pattern of fish diversity and identifying the factors that influence fish species richness. Maintaining undisturbed streams and river basins, especially headwater regions is crucial for sustaining freshwater biodiversity in the tropical river ecosystems.\\'Abstract: \\'A multi-thematic analysis based on different physical factors has been adopted to generate integrated maps on erosion proneness as well as on critical slope under a GIS platform for terrain evaluation. This spatial data on erosion proneness has demonstrated that 17.62 km2 area, out of the 140 km2 in the catchment zone, needs careful attention for ecorestoration. In the critical slope map four land stability classes have been demarcated. The area represented as Unstable and Moderately-stable is found to be important for slope stability problems. Temporal change in the drainage network over a period of four decades as well as the extent of loss in the perennial status of tributaries have been recorded to evaluate the landform changes. A catchment treatment plan has also been suggested.\\'Abstract: \\'This study examined the impact of disturbance on the pattern of diversity, forest structure and regeneration of tree species in the Vindhyan dry tropical forest of India. A total of distributed over five, 3-ha permanent plots in five sites, differing in degree of disturbance, were used to enumerate and measure the tree species. A total of 65 species with 136,983 individuals were enumerated in the total 15-ha area for stems height. The number of species and number of stems ranged from 12 to 50 and 3-ha area. The number of species and stems for trees ranged from 3 to 28 species, with a mean value of 16 species and from 16 to 477 stems, with a mean value of 256 stems respectively. The adult based PCA ordination indicated uniqueness of sites in terms of species composition and habitat characteristics. PCA ordination also showed uniqueness of sites in terms of seedling composition, but the seedling and adult distributions were not spatially associated. The distinct species composition at the different sites and at the two life-cycle stages on the same site is indicative of marked spatio-temporal dynamics of the dry tropical forest. The semi-logarithmic curves ranged from a near linear to an overall concave appearance with a limited plateau in the mid-diameter ranges. The and its components decreased with increasing disturbance intensity, reflecting enhanced utilization pressure with increasing disturbance. The site-wise and species-wise regression analyses of the number of individuals in different stages of the species revealed that both the level of disturbance and the nature of species strongly affect the regeneration. In conclusion, although the forest is relatively species-poor, the differential species composition on different sites and the temporal dynamics lend a unique level of diversity to the tropical dry deciduous forest.\\'Abstract: \\'A potentially diagnostic 18S rDNA (ribosomal DNA) gene was amplified reliably from red-listed ethnomedicinal species of Myristica and its wild and related genera. Individuals from nine species of Myristicaceae were utilized for the study. The sequences ranged from 1,767 to 1,794 nucleotide (nt) in length. The GC content (%) varied from 52.77 to 51.04. The frequencies (%) of nt were A (23.31), T (23.82), C (24.48) and G (28.39). The alignment of all sequences produced 195/1,516 variable sites and 1,257/1,516 conserved sites. Total numbers of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites found in the alignment were 146/1,516. Knema andamanica (Warb.) W.J. de Wilde was the most distinct that included 18 variable regions and 15 InDel with 27 SNP sites, specific to this species. The identified regions from nine species of Myristica and its wild and closely related genera were deposited in the GenBank Database (Accession numbers JN228257-JN228265). Comparison of morphological identifications and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the specimens were correctly assigned on the basis of a short stretch of 18S rDNA making this a potentially useful marker for the rapid molecular assignment of an unknown related species also. Significant sequence homology ranging from 72 to was observed on comparison with 18S rDNA genes of other plants in the public domain. A comparison of intraspecific data information of nine 18S with that of 73 matK and 86 rbcL sequences from GenBank revealed that polymorphism, divergence and conservation is higher in 18S locus for Myristicaceae. Hence these markers may be utilized for phylogenetic analysis, evaluation of species richness during ecological surveys or for environmental assessments. These molecular markers are especially important due to the fact that the species studied are mostly vulnerable and red-listed with limited availability in endangered ecological niches.\\'Abstract: \\'The process of forest fragmentation, a common phenomenon occurring in tropical forests, not only results into continuously forest getting fragmented but also brings about several physical and biological changes in the environment of forests. Consequently, there is a loss of biodiversity due to change in habitat conditions. These remnant fragments provide the last hope for biodiversity conservation. The present study deals with the impact of decreasing patch size of a fragmented forest on the diversity of the tropical dry deciduous forests in Vindhyan highlands, India. There is considerable change in the vegetation cover of this region owing to rapid industrialization and urbanization, which has also contributed to forest fragmentation. In the present study, remotely sensed data has been used to describe the changes brought about in vegetated areas over a period of as a result of fragmentation and its impact on biodiversity was assessed. Further, in order to assess the loss of species with respect to the reduction in patch size, species area curves for various change areas were analysed. It was observed that the rate of decrease in the number of species is faster in the case of negative change areas as compared to the positive change areas of the region. Various diversity indices also support this observation. Such an analysis would help in formulating appropriate conservation measures for the region.\\'Abstract: \\'Recent years have witnessed a rise in sensitivity towards protection of natural genetic resources and the environment at the international level. This is evident from the implementation of the convention on biodiversity (CBD). To conserve and optimize utilization of its bioresources, India enacted the Biological Diversity Act 2002. The conservation and management of aquatic resources is important for sustainable utilization of fisheries potential for the economic advancement of farmers and fishery workers, today as well as for posterity. As the biotechnological and genomic revolutions are ready to take off, the sovereign rights of native inhabitants to intellectual property rights (IPR) related to aquatic genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge are also integral components of management strategies for genetic resources.\\'Abstract: \\'A large number of economically disadvantaged people live around protected areas. Conservation efforts that focus on poverty alleviation, work on the premise that an increase in household wealth decreases use of forest resources. We surveyed 1222 households across four tiger reserves to test the paradigm that an increase in assets leads to reduced forest use and we also assess the effects of other socio-economic factors. We find that increase in assets may reduce Non-timber Forest Product (NTFP) collection, but may not necessarily reduce livestock numbers or use of wood as a cooking fuel. Households that faced more economic setbacks were more likely to state that they wanted more livestock in the future. Education is positively associated with choosing Liquefied Petroleum Gas as a cooking fuel in the future. We find site and resource-specific variation. Fifty percent of all households (range across sites: want to collect NTFP while 91% (range: want to retain or own more livestock over the next Understanding current and future resource use will help plan context-specific conservation efforts that are better aligned with reducing specific pressures around protected areas.\\'Abstract: \\'Whereas much attention is paid to the conservation and management of threatened species of primates, little work is reported on the species that are at lower risk. We report data on demography and population dynamics in commensal bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata radiata) sharing human habitats in Intensive Cultivation, Dry Cultivation and Scrub Forest zones around the city of Mysore, south India. We also compare the data with the previous data collected in 1989 and 1998 on the same groups by our research team. The population has suffered an overall decline of 21.3% (at an intrinsic rate (r) of with Dry Cultivation habitat alone recording over 41% decline in 14 years. The Dry Cultivation habitat has also shown increased population fragmentation due to increased distance among groups, and decreased numbers of individuals per subpopulation. In Dry Cultivation areas, the number of small groups has been increasing, whereas the number of medium and large groups has been decreasing. We discuss such trends in the context of human-monkey conflict for shared resources. We propose that effective conservation strategies for lower risk species, especially if they are by-and-large commensal, must be planned now before they become threatened. We further propose that Scrub Forests with places of worship, and with the least human-monkey conflict but otherwise close to intensively used human habitats, are the most suitable and stable habitats for conservation of bonnet macaques.\\'Abstract: \\'Focal species are valuable tools for evaluating management practices for biodiversity conservation. Butterfly gardening through the creation of appropriate habitats can be a primary conservation tool to increase species abundance and richness and gene flow among the populations in fragmented landscapes. In this context, the role of butterfly gardens in the conservation of butterfly populations and the seasonal population trends of swallowtail butterflies (family Papilionidae) sighted in the Butterfly Safari Park at Thenmala were studied. A total of 4760 sightings of 15 species of swallowtails belonging to five genera were recorded, of which six were endemic species, three species had protected status and two were rare species. It is worth noting that of the 19 species of the papilionids recorded in Kerala, as many as 15 species were recorded in Thenmala. Of the various species recorded, Troides minos, Pachliopta pandiyana, Pachliopta aristolochiae, Graphium agamemnon, Graphium sarpedon, Papilio polytes, Papilio clytia, Papilio demoleus and Papilio polymnestor comprised the resident populations, while species such as Atrophaneura hector, Papilio helenus, Papilio dravidarum, Papilio paris, Papilio liomedon and Graphium nomius were found only during certain seasons. The overall butterfly abundance was high from August to November. The butterfly populations exhibited a gradual decline in numbers from December onwards with the onset of dry seasons. The abundance of butterfly populations was low during The abundance of T. minos, P. pandiyana, P. polymnestor, P. paris, P. dravidarum, P. helenus, P. polytes and P. liomedon showed a significant negative correlation with monthly average temperature and a significant positive correlation with humidity.\\'Abstract: \\'We examined demographic consequences of habitat fragmentation in the lion-tailed macaque in the Anamalai Hills in southern Western Ghats. The parameters examined were group size, age/sex composition, and birth rate, in relation to various habitat parameters. Demographic parameters were estimated for 11 groups in 8 rain forest fragments, during January to May 1996. Area, tree density, canopy cover, canopy height, and tree basal area were estimated for these fragments. As fragment area decreased, there was a decline in birth rate and proportion of immatures in the group, and an increase in the number of adult males, and the variability in group size and adult sex ratios. A similar pattern was also observed with decreasing values of other habitat variables. Differences in the founder population size and age structure, demographic randomness, and history of poaching have caused greater variability in group size and adult sex ratios in the small fragments. The lack of dispersal in the small fragments is another reason for the high variability.\\'Abstract: \\'The Western Ghats constitute one of the three biodiversity hot spots in India, which is under constant threat from various quarters. Among the several anthropogenic causes, fire is one of the important anthropogenic factor, which plays a pivotal role in vegetation succession and ecosystem processes. It is very important to understand the ecological changes due to fire and other anthropogenic factors for conservation and management of biodiversity. Because of its synoptic, multi-spectral and multi-temporal nature remote sensing data can be a good source for forest fire monitoring. In the present study, an effort has been made to monitor the burnt areas using March 2000 and 2004 IRS LISS III data. The study revealed that an area of 2.15 km2 and 4.46 km2 was affected by fire in 2000 and 2004 respectively. Repeated drought, followed by mass flowering and dying of bamboo accelerated the spread of fire from ground to canopy in areas with high bamboo density.\\'Abstract: \\'We assessed the diversity of woody plants at 15 forested sites in the Tansa Valley of Thane District, in Maharashtra, India. The fewest species (11) were seen at a degraded mangrove site near the river mouth, and the greatest number (150) in the rich semi-evergreen forest on Tungar Hill. For all sites there were 141 tree, 25 shrub and 15 liana species, a total of 181 species. Excluding the mangrove site, which had no species in common with the other 14 sites, we analyzed the species distributions in detail. These sites ranged in area from 4 to 30 km2 each, had woody floras of 89 6 species, and varied in intensity of human impact. Despite a history of exploitation and substantial reduction in biomass from firewood collecting, set fires and illicit tree felling, considerable plant diversity remains in the area. We found a modest increase in species richness in transects away from two villages. We observed the exploitation of the forest by the principal users, primarily of the Warli Tribe. They exploited a wide variety of forest resources (92 species), for medicines, foods, construction materials, household goods, manure and other purposes. They collected 15 items for sale. By far the single most important item collected was firewood, which dramatically reduced forest biomass within 2 km of villages. The species distributions in these forest remnants are strongly nested, mostly due to varying degrees of disturbance at individual sites. The high species diversity on Tungar Hill is most likely a relict of the earlier character of forests throughout much of the valley. It merits the highest priorities for preservation, as a refuge for Western Ghat species at the northern limits of their distributions.\\'Abstract: \\'Biodiversity conservation requires prioritization of areas for in situ conservation. In that perspective, the present study documents the global diversity of a component of the soil macrofauna, the land planarians, and concerns an exploratory analysis of their possible role as indicators of biodiversity. Diversity is described by three quantitative methods: (1) hotspots of species richness, selecting areas richest in species, (2) hotspots of range-size rarity, identifying areas richest in narrowly endemic species, and (3) complementarity, prioritizing areas according to their greatest combined species richness. The biodiversity measures of species richness and range-size rarity show a great correspondence in the identification of hotspots of diversity; both measures identify the following seven areas as the most biodiverse for land planarians: Sao Paulo, Florianopolis, western Java, Tasmania, Sri Lanka, North Island/New Zealand, and Sydney. It is discussed to what extent the results for the land planarians correspond with those obtained in other studies that assessed biodiversity hotspots for taxa on a global scale. It is noteworthy that land planarians identify a few global hotspots of diversity that generally do not feature, or only have low rankings, in other studies: New Zealand, southeastern Australia, and Tasmania.\\'Abstract: \\'The use of paddock trees by birds was assessed in a grazinglandscape in southern New South Wales, Australia. Seventy paddock treesites were surveyed for 20 min each in the morning, and 36sites were surveyed again at midday in March 2000. During this time, thepresence and abundance of birds was recorded. Several site and landscapevariables were measured at each site. These included tree species, atree size index, a measure of the crown cover density around the site,and proximity to the nearest woodland patch. During formal surveys, 31bird species, including several woodland species, were observed usingpaddock trees. Data from bird surveys in woodland patches that wereobtained in a separate study in November 1999 were used to comparewhether there was a relationship between the abundance of a given birdspecies in woodland patches and paddock trees. Many birds commonlydetected in woodland patches were also common in paddock trees. However,some birds with special habitat requirements were absent from paddocktrees although they were common in woodland patches. Site occupancypatterns were modelled for several guilds of birds using logisticregression. Foliage-foraging birds were more likely to occupy clumps oftrees and sites with a high tree size index. Nectarivores appeared to bemore likely to be detected at sites more than 200 m fromwoodland, although this result was marginally non-significant(P = 0.08). The probability of detecting granivoreswas higher at sites with a low tree size index. Open country specieswere most likely to occupy large trees and sites that were located morethan 200 m from the nearest woodland patch. The value ofpaddock trees may have been underestimated in the past because a widevariety of bird species use paddock trees on a regular basis. Ensuringthe continued survival of paddock trees should be an important aspect offuture conservation and revegetation efforts.\\'Abstract: \\'Aapravasi Ghat is a World Heritage property and represents the mass immigration of Indentured Laborers after slavery. The Indenture Labor System started in 1834 but the site was established as a permanent immigration depot in 1849. For about a century the depot was used for arrival and departure of indentured laborers from Asian and African countries. Archaeological investigations highlighted the space distribution and everyday functioning of the depot. Simultaneously, structural modifications made before, during and after its occupation as a depot, could be identified. This paper relates the findings made through historical archaeological research and reconstruct the site during the different time period while focusing on the indenture period.\\'Abstract: \\'Hill areas form one of the most fragile ecosystems vulnerable to all kind of human influences. Low productivity of hill lands and rampant poverty among the hill population call for adequate attention to be given towards sustainable development of land and water resources of the hill areas. Remote sensing offers one of the most viable technological solutions for generating data on natural resources of an area. The Geographical Information System technology offers an appropriate method for integrating the land and water resources information and for identifying agroclimatically coherent zones for suggesting locale specific prescriptions and treatment packages. In the present study using capabilities offered by the satellite remote sensing and geographical information system technology an attempt has been made to develop and suggest sustainable development plan for the hill areas of Sakaleshpur and Alur taluks of Hassan district (approx. 1466 sq km area) of the Karnataka state. Integrated analysis of factors such as topography, rainfall pattern, landuse practices, status of natural resources (wastelands, soils, forest, water resources, etc.) land capability and environmental factors concerning the area has been carried out to suggest development plan for the study area. A set of 11 thematic maps (on scale) have been prepared using remote sensing data and topomaps and compiled in the form of an atlas. Landuse statistics obtained from remote sensing data has been compared with the conventional landuse statistics reported by the State Department of Economics and Statistics and both are found to be in good agreement with each other percent).\\'Abstract: \\'Simulation of moist convective processes is critical for accurately representing the interaction among tropical wave activities, atmospheric water vapor transport, and clouds associated with the Indian monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillation (ISO). In this study, we apply the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to simulate Indian monsoon ISO with three different treatments of moist convective processes: (1) the (BMJ) adjustment cumulus scheme without explicit simulation of moist convective processes; (2) the New Simplified (NSAS) mass-flux scheme with simplified moist convective processes; and (3) explicit simulation of moist convective processes at convection permitting scale (Nest). Results show that the BMJ experiment is unable to properly reproduce the equatorial Rossby wave activities and the corresponding phase relationship between moisture advection and dynamical convergence during the ISO. These features associated with the ISO are approximately captured in the NSAS experiment. The simulation with resolved moist convective processes significantly improves the representation of the ISO evolution, and has good agreements with the observations. This study features the first attempt to investigate the Indian monsoon at convection permitting scale.\\'Abstract: \\'This special issue is dedicated to the in vitro tools and methods used to conserve the genetic diversity of rare and threatened plant species from around the world. Species that are on the brink of extinction because of the rapid loss of genetic diversity and habitat come mainly from resource-poor areas of the world and from global biodiversity hotspots and island countries. These species are unique because they are endemic, and only a few small populations or sometimes only a few individuals remain in the wild. Therefore, the challenges to support conservation by in vitro measures are many and varied. The editors of this invited issue solicited papers from experts from Asia, Africa, Europe, Australia, and North and South America. This compilation of articles describes the efforts in these diverse regions toward saving plants from extinction, and details the direct application of in vitro and cryopreservation methods. In addition, these contributions provide guidance on propagation of rare plants, including techniques for large-scale propagation, storage, and reintroduction. The in vitro techniques for conserving plant biodiversity include shoot apical or axillary-meristem-based micropropagation, somatic embryogenesis, cell culture technologies and embryo rescue techniques, as well as a range of in vitro cold storage and cryopreservation protocols, and they are discussed in depth in this issue.\\'Abstract: \\'Sixteen species of Anisochilus are reviewed. Full synonymy, information about types, distributions, and a key to species are given. The type of the little known A. adenanthus Dalzell has been found and the widely used A. verticillatus is a synonym. A. sericeus and A. dysophylloides var. purpureus are synonyms of A. dysophylloides. A. henryi, a recently published name is a synonym of A. robustus. Nine names are lectotypified. The genus occurs in South Asia, from the East Himalaya, North Thailand, and South China in the North to Sri Lanka and Peninsular Thailand in the South.\\'Abstract: \\'Rhesus and bonnet macaques are the 2 most common and widely distributed of the 8 macaque species of India. Rhesus macaques are widely distributed across southern and southeastern Asia, whereas bonnet macaques are restricted to peninsular India. We studied the current distributional limits of the 2 species, examined patterns of their coexistence in the interspecific border zones, and evaluated losses in the distributional range of bonnet macaques over the last 3 decades. Our results indicate that whereas rhesus macaques have extended their geographical range into the southern peninsula, bonnet macaques have been displaced from many areas within their former distributional range. The southern and the northern distributional limits for rhesus and bonnet macaques, respectively, currently run parallel to each other in the western part of the country, are separated by a large gap in central India, and converge on the eastern coast of the peninsula to form a distribution overlap zone. This overlap region is characterized by the presence of mixed-species troops, with pure troops of both species sometimes occurring even in close proximity to one another. The range extension of rhesus natural process in some areas and a direct consequence of introduction by humans in other grave implications for the endemic and declining populations of bonnet macaques in southern India.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'The paper discusses the advantages aerial photographs offer for a quick appraisal of geomorphic surfaces in a terrain of low to moderate relief, high vegetative cover with considerable human activities. The area studied comprises the coastal tracts between Calicut and Ernakulam and the midlands immediately to the east. Two morphological units, namely the costal plain and uplands constitute the terrain between the Western Ghats and the sea. The costal plain from west to east comprise a narrow beach, a younger beach ridge plain, an older beach ridge plain and lateritic surface, generally plateau shaped with gentle to moderate slopes, terraced, dendritically dissected and with insignificant development of pediment. Further eastwards, the areas of high relief consists of hard crystalline rocks laterised at the top.\\'Abstract: \\'Climate change enhances invasive species distribution by altering species composition in native ecosystems. Here we assessed harmony in plant invasions of two perennial exotic species of similar origin and naturalised in India, i.e., Chromolaena odorata and Tridax procumbens. Predictions made for the current condition was subsequently projected for the years 2050 and 2100 for both moderate and extreme climate change scenarios. Maximum Entropy (Maxent) was applied to assess their habitat suitability, risk area identification and shifts in range sizes. The distribution of C. odorata could mostly depend on temperature and moisture availability; and invade the biodiversity-rich regions of India viz., the Eastern Ghats, the Western Ghats, the Eastern Himalaya and the north-eastern regions. The prevalence of T. procumbens in central regions of India could demonstrate its greater dependencies on precipitation seasonality and radiation than that on temperature. These discrepancies in climatic dependencies allowed both for a harmonious distribution, i.e., inhabiting in regions not utilised by other. Both are likely to reduce their potential distribution areas in the future climate, where moisture availability is a key factor for their range expansion. The capacity to tolerate a wide range of temperature and solar radiation allowed T. procumbens to manage climate change impacts more efficiently, compared with C. odorata. The present study reveals harmony in their distributions and suggests distinct conservation protocols for each of them to control their invasion risks.\\'Abstract: \\'A primary need in conserving species and their habitats is defining distinct genetic entities that range from individuals to species to ecosystems and beyond. The development of molecular genetic markers revolutionized the field of fish genetics. Using DNA markers, genetic variation in the entire genome can be analysed and exploited. Here, we outline the molecular genetic methods for species and population identification in fish and their applications to a variety of fisheries management and aquaculture issues with special emphasis on aquatic germplasm resources of India that have enormous potential to contribute to the genetic improvement of species and sustaining threatened wild stocks.\\'Abstract: \\'This study focuses on the assessment of the status of remaining closed forests (WRCF), population distribution, and protected areas in global biodiversity hotspots using remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS). Conservation International (CI) has identified 25 eco-regions, called biodiversity hotspots that are especially rich in endemic species and are particularly threatened by human activities. This study uses globally consistent and comprehensive geo-spatial data sets generated using rerriote sensing and other sources, and the application of GIS layering methods. The consistent data set has made it possible to identify and quantify relationships between the WRCF, human population, and protected areas in biodiversity hotspots. It is expected that such information will provide a scientific basis for biodiversity hotspots management and assist in policy formulations at the national and international levels.\\'Abstract: \\' Pandanus mangalorensis, a new species from the Mangalore district, Karnataka state, India is described and illustrated. The new species differs from other Pandanus species in having prominent multiple branching, triangular infructescence, drupes arranged on a bony triangular ring, drupe apex pyramidal with acute and bifid style and stigma and central projection extended up to style base. The species appears to be endemic to the collection site and is assigned as Critically Endangered (CR) based on IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria.\\'Abstract: \\'The impact of diseases such as Phytophthora foot rot and the replacement of unproductive cultivars by high yielding ones has brought about the disappearance of varieties in Piper species, like any other crop. Black pepper (King of spices), is a major spice crop consumed throughout the world. It is widely cultivated across various parts of the world apart from India. The different cultivars may be genetically related and could be a source of valuable genes for disease resistance and an increase in quantity and quality. Even though Western Ghats in India is believed to be the site of origin of this crop, numerous accessions from the NBPGR have not yet been evaluated. Our study aims to investigate the genetic relatedness in major cultivars of black pepper using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism.\\'Abstract: \"India has 19 370 small reservoirs with a total water surface area of 3 153 366 ha. At least 100 of them have been subjected to scientific studies. Habitat variables responsible for a reservoir\\'s productivity can be summed up into climatic, morphometric and hydro-edaphic factors. The peninsular reservoirs are characterized by a narrow range of fluctuations in water and air temperature across seasons, a phenomenon which prevents the formation of thermal stratification. Many reservoirs in the upper peninsula show thermal stratification during summer. Wind-induced turbulence facilitates the return of nutrients to the trophogenic zone. Most reservoirs on the mountain slopes of Western Ghats, Himalayas and the other highlands are deeper, with steeper basin walls, compared to irrigation impoundments. Mean depth does not show any direct correlation with productivity, either at primary or fish level. A high shoreline development index gives a better indication of productivity. Plankton, benthos and periphyton pulses of Indian reservoirs coincide with the months of least level fluctuations. Oligotrophic tendencies shown by some reservoirs are mainly due to poor nutrient status and other chemical deficiencies. In most cases, poor water quality is accountable to poor catchment soil. Low levels of phosphate and nitrate are not indicative of low productivity due to quick recycling of these nutrients. Specific conductivity reflects the production propensities of reservoirs satisfactorily. Almost all productive reservoirs have a klinograde oxygen curve and a vertical stratification of chemical variables such as pH, carbon dioxide, total alkalinity and specific conductivity. High seasonal rainfall and discharge of water during monsoon result in high flushing rates, which do not favour colonization by macrophytic communities. Similarly, inadequate availability of suitable substrata retards the growth of periphyton. Plankton constitutes the major link in the trophic structure. A rich plankton community with well-marked succession is the hallmark of Indian reservoirs with blue-green algae as the major component. The main factors that retard the growth of benthos are a rocky bottom, frequent water level fluctuation and rapid deposition of silt and other suspended particles. Large reservoirs, on average, harbour 60 species of fishes, of which at least 40 contribute to the commercial fisheries. Fast-growing Indian major carps are the prominent commercial fishes. Dam construction has adversely affected populations of many other species such as Tenualosa ilisha, Torspp. and Cirrhinus spp. Formulae for estimating fish yield potential and stocking density are described. While culture-based fisheries have been successfully practiced in many small reservoirs, the management norm followed in medium and large reservoirs is primarily on capture fishery. In large and medium reservoirs, stocking was successful only when stocked fishes bred. Indian experience on species enhancement and introductions is described. Environmental enhancement of small reservoirs has been attempted in some reservoirs of Tamil Nadu. Modeling, using standard population parameters, such as the density-dependent growth, size dependent mortalityand relationshipis discussed. Two exotic fishes viz., Oreochromis mossambicus and Cyprinus carpio have been introduced into Indian reservoir with discouraging results. Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, after an accidental introduction, has performed well in Gobindsagar, a reservoir with a distinct cold water regime. Reservoir fisheries in India are well poised for development, provided scientific management norms are adopted.\"Abstract: \\'A survey of 35 tree species (belonging to 28 genera in 19 families) in Aliyar, South India was carried out to ascertain their arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and dark septate endophyte (DSE) fungal status. All the tree species examined had AM association. AM and DSE colonization is reported for the first time in 20 and 14 species respectively. Cooccurrence of AM and DSE was observed in 14 (40%) tree species. The extent of DSE colonization was inversely related to the extent of AM fungal colonization. Six tree species had Arum-type, 18 had intermediatetype and 11 had typical Paris-type AM morphology. AM fungal spore morphotypes belonging to 11 species in two genera were isolated from the rhizosphere soil. AM fungal spore numbers were not related to the extent of AM colonization and Glomus dominated spore diversity. AM association individually and along with DSE were found respectively in the 63% and 44% of the economically important tree species. The occurrence of AM and DSE fungal association in economically important indigenous tree species indicates the possibility of exploiting this association in future conservation programmes of these species.\\'Abstract: \\'(Edited by A. Marshall)\\'Abstract: \\'Wildlife reserves are becoming increasingly isolated from the surrounding human-dominated landscapes particularly in Asia. It is imperative to understand how species are distributed spatially and temporally in and outside reserves, and what factors influence their occurrence. This study surveyed landscape surrounding five reserves in the Western Ghats to examine patterns of occurrence of five herbivores: elephant, gaur, sambar, chital, and pig. Species distributions are modeled spatio-temporally using an occupancy approach. Trained field teams conducted 3860 interview-based occupancy surveys in a 10-km buffer surrounding these five reserves in 2012. I found gaur and wild pig to be the least and most wide-ranging species, respectively. Elephant and chital exhibit seasonal differences in spatial distribution unlike the other three species. As predicted, distance to reserve, the reserve itself, and forest cover were associated with higher occupancy of all species, and higher densities of people negatively influenced occurrence of all species. Park management, species protection, and conflict mitigation efforts in this landscape need to incorporate temporal and spatial understanding of species distributions. All species are known crop raiders and conflict prone locations with resources (such as water and forage) have to be monitored and managed carefully. Wildlife reserves and adjacent areas are critical for long-term persistence and habitat use for all five herbivores and must be monitored to ensure wildlife can move freely. Such a large-scale approach to map and monitor species distributions can be adapted to other landscapes to identify and monitor critical habitats shared by people and wildlife.\\'Abstract: \\'The diversity of Indian lichen flora has undergone a considerable decline in the last five decades. Among the various anthropogenic activities, overexploitation and selective removal of economically important lichens have become major threats to the lichen flora of the country. Commercial samples of lichens collected from different states of India were studied for their source and commercial use. Among samples offered for sale, 38 different lichen species were identified. The western Himalayas proved to be the main area for lichen collection, while some lichen species also come from the central and Western Ghats. Local traders coordinate the lichen collection and then sell the material to traders in the foothills, and from there it is processed and distributed to other parts of the country and abroad. Because lichens belonging to the families Parmeliaceae and Physciaceae are the ones most exploited commercially, they are recommended for inclusion in the CITES list.\\'Abstract: \\'The present study were made to estimate the avian fauna in terms of species richness and diversity and guild structure in forest habitats of Nainital district of Uttarakhand m asl; N). Field studies were conducted during January 2007 to December 2008. Total 43, 62 and 42 species were recorded from, Haldwani, Bhowali and Nainital forest habitats. Results indicate the species relationship between Bird species richness (BSR) and elevation sections (forest habitats) was not decline simultaneously along elevation; it shows hump shaped. BSR varied considerably along elevational gradient (43 to 62 species), was highest (62 species) at mid elevation (Mixed pine forest, m asl) and decreased (20 species) at high elevation (Conifer forest, m asl). It seems that mid altitude bulge is not caused by the presence of a group of mid altitude specialists but rather that there is an overlap in the distribution of low land and high elevation specialists at this altitude. A checklist of 79 avian species has also produced of Nainital district forest habitats. It is suggested that this study provide a base line structure for further study on species distribution in different forest habitats and along different elevation section in Western Himalayas (India).\\'Abstract: \\'The diversity of plants in tropical forests makes dietary studies of frugivores difficult. This paper provides a botanical inventory of a tropical seasonal forest community in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand. The forest is valuable from a conservation perspective because it is one of the last remaining intact forests in northeastern Thailand, and is an important refuge for many animal and plant species. A 4-ha inventory plot measuring 200 was established and all plants greater than or equal to in diameter at breast height (dbh) were measured and permanently labeled. We found 1610 stems belonging to 105 species, 76 genera and 35 families, with a combined basal area of The community was dominated by species of Lauraceae, Cornaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Meliaceae, and Elaeocarpaceae. About one-third of the plant species (40 spp.) identified in this study were vulnerable to extinction because they were mostly dispersed by large frugivores, which were intolerant of human impact. If they disappear, these forests may become dominated by plant species that are dispersed by abiotic means and species with small-seeded fruits.\\'and economic importance\\'Abstract: \\' Hypericum hookerianum (Hypericaceae), a critically endangered plant of Western Ghats, India, has acquired significant importance due to its medicinal implications and ornamental flowers. This species is under severe anthropogenic pressure due to urbanization, tourism, and plantation activities taking place in their natural habitat. A clonal propagation strategy is standardized in this species which offers an opportunity for a stable production of active metabolites from this species as well as their conservation. The study deals with the optimization of axillary bud proliferation using nodal explants followed by genetic stability analysis of regenerants. Maximum number of shoots (3.66) was observed on the Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with Kinetin with shoot multiplication frequency. In vitro grown shoots were rooted best in 1/2 MS medium supplemented with indole-3-butyric acid with an average of and rooting frequency. Plantlets were acclimatized best in a mixture of sterile sand and farmyard manure (3:1). Micropropagated plants were subjected to random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis and phytochemical analysis to confirm their clonal stability. In RAPD analysis, 1032 amplicons were collectively generated which were monomorphic and similar to the mother plant. The comparable major phytochemical constituents in regenerants and mother plants together with genetic uniformity data obtained from RAPD analysis confirmed clonal fidelity of the regenerants. Findings in this study are the first report on micropropagation and assessment of genetic stability of micropropagated plantlets in H. hookerianum which suggests that in vitro axillary shoot proliferation can effectively be used as a tool for propagation and conservation of H. hookerianum.\\'Abstract: \\'The complete mitochondrial genome of the endemic frog Indirana semipalmata was sequenced. The mitogenome is a circular molecule of in length, containing 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA (r RNA) genes, 21 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and a non-coding D-loop region (control region). Its gene arrangements are similar to the typical neobatrachian-type except for the loss of tRNA  Asn  gene. Our data, which represent the first mitogenome for the genus, will serve as a reference for further studies on the conservation genetics of the endemic amphibian fauna of the Western Ghats.\\'Abstract: \\'To characterize the genetic diversity of present populations of Symplocos laurina, which grow in the montane forests in India, we analyzed the DNA sequences of a nuclear gene. Using the sequence of cytosolic Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, we detected 24 haplotypes among 195 individuals sampled from 14 populations. Two dominant haplotypes were distributed over the entire range of this species in India and several private haplotypes were found. Low genetic diversity within population, high differentiation, number of population specific haplotypes and deviation from neutral evolution characterized the present populations of S. laurina. An analysis of molecular variance indicated the presence of geographic structure within the haplotype distribution. The occurrence of S. laurina preglaciation in India is the most parsimonious explanation for the current geographic structure observed. The populations are presumably ancient and might have spread across its extant distribution range in India through a recent range expansion event.\\'Multi-resolution remote sensing (RS) data coupled with additional ancillary topographical layers (both remotely acquired or derived from ground measurements) with appropriate classification strategies would be more effective in capturing LC dynamics and changes associated with the natural resources. Ancillary information would make the decision boundaries between the LC classes more widely separable, enabling classification with higher accuracy compared to conventional methods of RS data classification. In this work, we ascertain the possibility of improvement in classification accuracy of RS data with the addition of ancillary and derived geographical layers such as vegetation indices, temperature, digital elevation model, aspect, slope and texture, implemented in three different terrains of varying landscape (Greater Bangalore), forested landscape (Western Ghats) and rugged terrain (Western The study showed that use of additional spatial ancillary and derived information significantly improved the classification accuracy compared to the classification of only original spectral bands. The analysis revealed that in a highly urbanised area with less vegetation cover and contrasting features, inclusion of elevation and texture increased the overall accuracy of IKONOS data classification to 88.72% (3.5% improvement), and inclusion of temperature, NDVI, EVI, elevation, slope, aspect, Panchromatic band along with texture measures, significantly increased the overall accuracy of Landsat ETM+ data classification to 83.15% (7.6% improvement). In a forested landscape with moderate elevation, temperature was useful in improving the overall accuracy by 6.7 to 88.26%, and in a rugged terrain with temperate climate, temperature, EVI, elevation, slope, aspect and Panchromatic band significantly improved the classification accuracy to 89.97% (10.84% improvement) compared to the classification of only original spectral bands, suggesting selection of appropriate ancillary data depending on theAbstract: \\'Deforestation and fragmentation are important concerns in managing and conserving tropical forests and have global significance. In the Indian context, in the last one century, the forests have undergone significant changes due to several policies undertaken by government as well as increased population pressure. The present study has brought out spatiotemporal changes in forest cover and variation in forest type in the state of Odisha (Orissa), India, during the last period. The mapping for the period of 1975, 1985, 1995 and 2010 indicates that the forest cover accounts for and of the study area, respectively. The study found the net forest cover decline as of the total forest and mean annual rate of deforestation as during 1935 to 2010. There is a decline in annual rate of deforestation during 1995 to 2010 which was estimated as Forest type-wise quantitative loss of forest cover reveals large scale deforestation of dry deciduous forests. The landscape analysis shows that the number of forest patches (per 1,000) are 2.463 in 1935, 10.390 in 1975, 11.899 in 1985, 12.193 in 1995 and 15.102 in 2010, which indicates high anthropogenic pressure on the forests. The mean patch size (km2) of forest decreased from 33.2 in 1935 to 5.5 in 1975 and reached to 3.2 by 2010. The study demonstrated that monitoring of long term forest changes, quantitative loss of forest types and landscape metrics provides critical inputs for management of forest resources.\\'Abstract: \\'Water quality of a river is a function of surrounding environment and land use due to its connectivity with land, resulting in pollutants finding their way through land. This necessitates a spatially explicit study of river ecology. The paper presents a pioneer study to establish and explore the linkage between land use and water quality of river Ganga in Varanasi district. The land use land cover (LULC) map of of river stretch for buffer radii of in Varanasi revealed that riparian vegetation is negligible in the district. The hierarchical cluster analysis of LULC data suggested that there are two major land use categories, viz., urban and agriculture. The land use wise principal component analysis (PCA) suggested that urbanized areas are major contributor of metals, whereas agricultural land contributes organic matter into the river. The Spearman correlation study revealed that with rising urbanization, the pollutant load into the river increased compared to that from agricultural land use. The statistical analysis of the data clearly concluded that water quality of river Ganga at Varanasi was a function of adjacent land use. The study provides an insight anticipating the Indian government to embrace the relationship of land use to river water quality while formulating policies for the upcoming River Regulation Zone.\\'Abstract: \\'In the foreseeable future there is little likelihood of achieving consensus on the number of Asian primate genera and species, and their subspecific composition. There is a more realistic hope of reaching agreement on the number of recognizable subspecies. The latter objective is more urgent because in order to reliably assess generic and specific numbers, it is essential that effective conservation measures are implemented for as many subspecies as possible. This cannot be comprehensively accomplished until their validity is assessed and they are satisfactorily established and defined. The Asian primate classification that we present is the outcome of electronic communication among the co-authors after a workshop, which was especially convened to attempt to determine the number of recognizable primate subspecies and to identify potentially recognizable subspecies. The generic and specific arrangement is a compromise that does not necessarily reflect the individual views of the co-authors: 183 subspecies in 77 species in 16 genera. The 31 subspecies allotted a low credibility rating are almost balanced by the 22 scientifically unnamed populations that may warrant subspecific status.\\'Abstract: \\'Tropical agro-forest landscapes are potentially valuable reserves of forest genetic resources for forestry and restoration of degraded forests. The Dipterocarpaceae is a dominant Southeast Asian family of tree species of global significance for the tropical timber industry. Very little information exists about how effective human modified landscapes are for conserving genetic diversity in dipterocarp species. This study provides a baseline for understanding how fragmented agro-forest landscapes in India sustain forest genetic resources in an endemic dipterocarp tree. We compare genetic diversity and fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) in the threatened tree species Vateria indica within an isolated and a continuous forest site in the Western Ghats, South India. We place these results in the context of dipterocarps from both the Seychelles and Borneo. Parentage analysis of 694 progeny using twelve nuclear microsatellite markers is applied to estimate pollen and seed dispersal. Using a nursery trial we evaluate effects of inbreeding on growth performance. Our results show that levels of FSGS, and gene dispersal are comparable between a small isolated and a large continuous site of V. indica. Realized long-distance pollen flow into the isolated patch appears to help maintaining genetic diversity. The nursery experiment suggests that selection favours outbred progeny. Individuals of V. indica in close proximity appear less related to each other than in another highly fragmented and endangered dipterocarp species from the Seychelles, but more related than in three dipterocarp species studied in continuous forest in Borneo. We discuss the wider implications of our findings in the context of conservation and restoration of dipterocarp forest genetic resources in fragmented populations.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Wildlife conservation is a complex issue especially when it involves large carnivores or mega-herbivores that are conflict-prone. Karnataka state in southern India is known to harbor high density of wild elephants. This conservation success story also has opportunity costs for communities living in close proximity to elephants. Despite the fact that conflict is a serious conservation and social issue, there is little quantitative understanding of conflict especially over large areas. Here we conduct the first analysis of conflict distribution, severity and explanatory factors over the entire state of Karnataka. We use data from the state forest department records on villages that experience conflict, compensation payments made by the government, elephant densities, forest cover and perimeter, and presence of physical barriers to mitigate elephant conflict. In total, 60,939 incidences of crop loss were reported and US$ paid in compensation during April 2011. A total of 91 people were killed by elephants and 101 elephants died in retaliatory killings during the study period. A total of of the geographic area covering 25 of the 42 forest administrative divisions were affected. There was no significant difference in conflict incidences or compensation given between protected areas and non-protected areas. There was no correlation between conflict incidences/unit area and elephant density, forest cover, forest perimeter of protected areas and presence of physical barriers. The results depict the importance of efficient management of physical barriers, conserving key habitat linkages, and acts as baseline data for future work.\\'Abstract: \\'Genetic variation, haplotype relationships, and potential regions of diversity in Symplocos laurina Wall.

The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique was used to determine the chloroplast (cp) and mitochondrial (mt) DNA haplotypes of 218 individuals from 12 populations, collected from Northeast India (NEI), which is a part of Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot, and South India, which includes the Western Ghats (WG), another biodiversity hotspot from India and Eastern Ghats (EG). Nine cpDNA (chlorotypes) and 24 mtDNA haplotypes (mitotypes) were identified; the WG region was identified as the most diverse for chlorotypes and the NEI region for mitotypes. Although a strong population differentiation was observed, phylogeographic structure was found to be absent for both the genomes. The haplotype network revealed the presence of two main lineages: NEI-WG lineage and EG lineage, largely without overlapping distributions. The study tests two hypotheses, namely vicariance and dispersal, to understand the distribution of plants in India. The population structure of S. laurina strongly suggests the persistence of the species in putative refugial areas preglaciation and further establishment of other populations of S. laurina from these refugial populations.\\'Abstract: \\'Anthropogenic disturbances influence plant regeneration and species diversity, which impact the conservation status of protected areas. A study was conducted in the Sitakund Botanical Garden and Eco-park (SBGE), Chittagong, Bangladesh to analyze the natural regeneration and tree species diversity in disturbed and less disturbed zones. Stratified and systematic random sampling was used to select 50 sample plots from each of the two zones. A total number of 109 plant species from 43 families were recorded in the study; of which 93 species were of natural origin while the rest were planted. From the species with natural origin 66 were tree species, 9 were shrub species and 18 were climbers. Species richness, density of regeneration and disturbance index in the height classes m) and (dbh > 6 cm) indicated significant differences between the zones. The study analyzed how disturbances affect species diversity in the area. It was found that species richness and basal area are negatively related with disturbances. Moreover, density (N/ha) of trees was more likely to decrease with increasing tree height that reflects the huge demand of local people to harvest large trees as part of their income generating activities. The study findings have implications for future management decisions of the SGBE. To restore these ecosystems, management should focus on both biodiversity conservation and providing benefits to local people without hampering forest ecosystems.\\'Abstract: \\'Statistical downscaling (SD) establishes empirical relationships between coarse-resolution climate model simulations with higher-resolution climate variables of interest to stakeholders. These statistical relations are estimated based on historical observations at the finer resolutions and used for future projections. The implicit assumption is that the SD relations, extracted from data are stationary or remain unaltered, despite non-stationary change in climate. The validity of this assumption relates directly to the credibility of SD. Falsifiability of climate projections is a challenging proposition. Calibration and verification, while necessary for SD, are unlikely to be able to reproduce the full range of behavior that could manifest at decadal to century scale lead times. We propose a design-of-experiments (DOE) strategy to assess SD performance under nonstationary climate and evaluate the strategy via a transfer-function based SD approach. The strategy relies on selection of calibration and validation periods such that they represent contrasting climatic conditions like hot-versus-cold and ENSO-versus-non-ENSO years. The underlying assumption is that conditions such as warming or predominance of El may be more prevalent under climate change. In addition, two different historical time periods are identified, which resemble pre-industrial and the most severe future emissions scenarios. The ability of the empirical relations to generalize under these proxy conditions is considered an indicator of their performance under future nonstationarity. Case studies over two climatologically disjoint study regions, specifically India and Northeast United States, reveal robustness of DOE in identifying the locations where nonstationarity prevails as well as the role of effective predictor selection under nonstationarity.\\'Abstract: \\'A morphometric evaluation of Tamiraparani subbasin was carried out to determine the drainage characteristics using GIS model technique. Extraction of the subbasin and stream network model has been developed to quantify the drainage parameters in the study area. The input parameters required to run this model are: a pour point, a minimum upstream area in hectares, and a digital elevation model. After execution, the model provides a drainage basin with classified stream network supported by thematic layers like aspect, slope, relief, and drainage density. The developed model reveals that the drainage area of this subbasin is and shows subdendritic to dendritic drainage pattern. The basin includes seventh order stream and mostly dominated by lower stream order. The slope of the study area varies from in the east to towards west. The presence of Western Ghats is the chief controlling factor for slope variation. Moreover, the slope variation is controlled by the local lithology and erosion cycles. The bifurcation ratio indicates that the geological structures have little influence on the drainage networks and the drainage density reveals that the nature of subsurface strata is permeable.\\'Abstract: \\'Biodiversity hotspots are used widely to designate priority regions for conservation efforts. It is unknown, however, whether the current network of hotspots adequately represents globally threatened taxonomic diversity for whole plant and animal groups. We used a mammalian group traditionally neglected in terms of conservation efforts, the rodents, in order to test whether biodiversity hotspots match the current distribution of threatened taxa (genera and species). Significantly higher numbers of threatened rodent genera and species fell within biodiversity hotspots; nonetheless over 25% of the total threatened genera and species did not occur in any biodiversity hotspot. This was particularly true for the Australian region, where 100% of the threatened genera and species fell outside biodiversity hotspots, with many threatened taxa found in Papua-New Guinea. We suggest to officially including Papua New Guinea among biodiversity hotspots for rodents, and also the steppic/semidesert areas of central Asia.\\'Abstract: \\'The present paper reports a protocol for minimum growth conservation of Drosophyllum lusitanicum (L.) Link. in vitro. Double-node cuttings were maintained for 4, 8 and 12 months at 5 or 25 in the dark. The effects of sucrose either alone at 5, 20, 30, 40 and 60 g or at 20, 40 and 60 g in combination with 20 g mannitol, on survival and post-storage shoot multiplication efficiency were investigated. The cultures could effectively be conserved under minimum growth at 5 for 8 months on Murashige and medium supplemented with 60 g sucrose, 20 g mannitol and 0.91 zeatin. Following extended conservation, the cultures could be successfully regenerated into new shoots, and they were morphologically similar to those of non-stored controls.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'The history of ecology and evolutionary biology is rife with attempts to define and delimit species. However, there has been confusion between concepts and criteria, which has led to discussion, debate, and conflict, eventually leading to lack of consistency in delimitation. Here, we provide a broad review of species concepts, a clarification of category versus concept, an account of the general lineage concept (GLC), and finally a way forward for species discovery and delimitation. Historically, species were considered as varieties bound together by reproduction. After over 200 years of uncertainty, Mayr attempted to bring coherence to the definition of species through the biological species concept (BSC). This has, however, received much criticism, and the last half century has spawned at least 20 other concepts. A central philosophical problem is that concepts treat species as while the criteria for categorization treats them as While not getting away from this problem entirely, the GLC attempts to provide a framework where lineage divergence is influenced by a number of different factors (and correlated to different traits) which relate to the different species concepts. We also introduce an probabilistic approach for understanding and delimiting species. Finally, we provide a Wallacean (geography related) approach to the Linnaean problem of identifying and delimiting species, particularly for cases of allopatric divergence, and map this to the GLC. Going one step further, we take a morphometric terrain approach to visualizing and understanding differences between lineages. In summary, we argue that while generalized frameworks may work well for concepts of what species are, plurality and probabilistic approaches may work best for delimitation.\\'Abstract: \\'This article focuses on the relationship between priority-setting in conservation and in taxonomy. A simple and generally applicable scheme is presented series of 21 endemic fig tree species of Ficus sect. Oreosycea (Moraceae). The fig tree assessment is then compared with the available IUCN Red List data and with the collection information on two other groups of endemic tree radiations in New Caledonia: ebonies of Diospyros sect. Maba (Ebenaceae) and the Iguanura palm lineage (Arecaceae). We find a remarkably low level of extinction threat evident in Ficus but a pronounced need to differentiate between true species rarity and putative rarity of potential taxonomic artifacts. To this end it is proposed how such numerical evaluations can be used to set future priorities for the assessment or validation of the taxonomic and conservation status of taxa. The limitations and implications of the evaluation are discussed and relevant criteria for a meaningful analysis of collection records are listed. Finally, putting our results on woody plants into perspective, we briefly review the general conservation situation and outlook of New Caledonia, acknowledging both its high conservation priority and potential.\\'Abstract: \\'Pachmarhi biosphere reserve (PBR) encompasses 3 biodiversity conservation units viz. Pachmarhi Sanctuary, Satpura National Park and Bori Sanctuary, extending to an area of km. PBR has been recognized as one of the 26 endemic centers of the country and therefore the diversity of flora at the region holds much significance. The bryophyte diversity of PBR has been a matter of consideration by workers over several decades. The present work describes 13 epiphytes belonging to 9 families and 11 genera among which 5 taxa viz. Platygyriella aurea (Schwaegr.) Buck, Leucoloma Mitt., Meiothecium microcarpum (Hook.) Mitt., Leucobryum juniperoideum (Brid.) C. Muell. and Entodontopsis setschwanica (Broth.) Buck & Ireland are new to PBR. Stereophyllaceae, Hypnaceae and Dicranaceae emerged as relatively frequent families and Entodontopsis nitens and Entodontopsis leucostega as the dominant taxa. Epiphytic flora of a region accounts for ecological and environmental importance therefore, unveiling of epiphytic moss flora of PBR will undoubtedly aid in further studies on biodiversity.\\'Abstract: \\'We examined the impact of picnic activities on forest diversity, structure, regeneration and vitality of tree species in the Bhawal National Park of Bangladesh. The study area was classified as a non-used, occasionally used and frequently used area on the basis of the intensity of the picnic activities. A total of 43 plant species were enumerated in the whole study area. The highest plant species richness (41 species) was observed in the non-used area whereas the lowest species richness (11 species) in the frequently used area. The diversity index decreased with the increase of picnic intensity whereas the concentration of dominance increased. Density of all plant groups except mature trees, and the basal area of the mature trees showed a declining trend from the non-used to frequently used area. The frequently used area exhibited very poor regeneration. Tree vitality decreased with the increase of picnic intensity. The relevance of our study as a basis for further research to determine the impact of tourism on biodiversity in Bangladesh is discussed.\\'Abstract: \\'The use of paddock trees as stepping stones by birds was assessedin a grazing landscape in southern New South Wales, Australia. A totalof 70 paddock tree sites was surveyed for 20 min each inthe morning, and 36 sites were surveyed again in the afternoon in March2000. During the surveys, the presence, direction of arrival, anddirection of departure to and from sites was recorded for each bird. Astepping stone effect of paddock trees was examined in two ways: (1) byanalysing the arrival and departure direction of birds relative tosurrounding vegetation cover, and (2) by analysing the departuredirection of birds relative to their arrival direction. An arrivaldirection was obtained for 150 independently acting groups of birds, anda departure direction was obtained for 203 independently acting groupsof birds. Both arrival and departure direction were obtained for 87independently acting groups. Foliage-foraging birds tended to followrelatively densely vegetated areas. There was some indication thatgranivores and nectarivores also preferred to move along denselyvegetated areas. This trend was absent for open-country species. Allgroups of birds examined tended to return to their place of origin ormove in the opposite direction of their arrival. This trend was mostpronounced for nectarivores and the foliage-foraging White-plumedHoneyeater (Lichenostomus penicillatus), and lesspronounced for open-country species and parrots. The results arediscussed in relation to the biology and ecology of the various speciesof birds. We conclude that paddock trees have the potential to enhancelandscape connectivity by acting as stepping stones to assist movement.This further highlights their conservation value as demonstrated in thefirst paper of this series.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \"Mount Kawa Karpo of the Menri (\\'Medicine Mountains\\' in Tibetan), in the eastern Himalayas, is one of the most sacred mountains to Tibetan Buddhists. Numerous sacred sites are found between 1900 and and at higher elevations the area as a whole is considered a sacred landscape. Religious beliefs may affect the ecology of these sacred areas, resulting in unique ecological characteristics of importance to conservation; recent studies have demonstrated that sacred areas can often play a major role in conservation. The goal of this study is to preliminarily analyze the vegetation of sacred areas in the Menri region using existing vegetation maps and a Geographical Information System (GIS) for remote assessment. Sacred sites are compared to random points in the landscape, in terms of: elevation, vegetation, and nearness to villages; species composition, diversity, and richness; and frequency of useful and endemic plant species. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) ordination reveals that sacred sites differ significantly in both useful species composition (p=0.034) and endemic species composition (p=0.045). Sacred sites are located at lower elevations, and closer to villages, than randomly selected, non-sacred sites and have higher overall species richness (p=0.033) and diversity (p=0.042). In addition, the high-elevation areas of the mountain - a sacred landscape - are found to have significantly more endemics than low-elevation areas (p<0.0001). These findings represent an initial analysis of sacred sites and suggest that sacred sites in the Menri region may be ecologically and ethnobotanically unique.\"Abstract: Generous Nature: The Past and Present Uses of Wild Plants in Ireland.

Divakar and A. Crespo, as biomonitor. Thalli of R. awasthii were collected from eight sites of Mahabaleshwar area located in Western Ghats. Samples were prepared for HM and PAHs quantification by ICP-MS and HPLC, respectively. Total metal concentration (HM) ranged from 644 to while PAHs concentration between 0.193 and HM and PAHs concentrations were the highest at while control site (Lingmala Fall) exhibited the lowest concentration of HM as well as PAHs followed by samples from Wilson point (both these sites are having trekking route). It was also evident from this study that vehicular emission played a significant role in the release of HM and PAHs as pollutants in the environment. The effectiveness of R. awasthii as biomonitor could be further investigated by comparing this species with other biomonitors.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Soil moisture affects various hydrological processes, including evapotranspiration, infiltration, and runoff. Forested areas in the lower western Himalaya in India constitute the headwater catchments for many hill streams and have experienced degradation in forest cover due to grazing, deforestation and other human activities. This change in forest cover is likely to alter the soil moisture regime and, consequently, flow regimes in streams. The effect of change in forest cover on soil moisture regimes of this dry region has not been studied through long term field observations. We monitored soil matric potentials in two small watersheds in the lower western Himalaya of India. The watersheds consisted of homogeneous land covers of moderately dense oak forest and moderately degraded mixed oak forest. Observations were recorded at three sites at three depths in each watershed at fortnightly intervals for a period of three years. The soil moisture contents derived from soil potential measurements were analyzed to understand the spatial, temporal and profile variations under the two structures of forest cover. The analysis revealed large variations in soil moisture storage at different sites and depths and also during different seasons in each watershed. Mean soil moisture storage during monsoon, winter and summer seasons was higher under dense forest than under degraded forest. Highest soil moisture content occurred at shallow soil profiles, decreasing with depth in both watersheds. A high positive correlation was found between tree density and soil moisture content. Mean soil moisture content over the entire study period was higher under dense forest than under degraded forest. This indicated a potential for soil water storage under well managed oak forest. Because soil water storage is vital for sustenance of low flows, attention is needed on the management of oak forests in the Himalayan region.\\'Abstract: \\'In the context of over-consumption of natural resources in the name of development and rapid industrialization by a small section of the human population that is rapidly growing, the world is currently faced with a variety of environmental uncertainties. covering a whole variety of ecological issues, and in an economic sense, are two major phenomena that are responsible for these uncertainties. There is increasing evidence to suggest that the developing countries more than the developed, particularly the marginalized traditional (those living close to nature and natural resources) societies would be the worst sufferers. In order to cope with this problem in a situation where the traditional societies have to cope with rapidly depleting biodiversity on which they are dependant for their livelihood, there is an urgent need to explore additional pathways for sustainable management of natural resources and societal development. Such pathways should be based on a landscape management strategy, that takes into consideration the rich traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) that these societies have. This is critical because TEK is the connecting link between conservation and sustainable development. This paper explores the possibilities in this direction through a balanced approach to development, that links the with the in a location-specific way.\\'Abstract: \\'Based on ethnographic fieldwork in the pilgrimage and tourist town of Pushkar, India, this article looks at the environmental degradation that has befallen the holy lake there and explores efforts on the part of locals to clean it. While local Hindus believe unequivocally that their town is a heavenly place, many nevertheless recognize the need to actualize that belief. The article contends that the broad goal of making Pushkar paradise, and more specifically, the task of cleaning the lake, involves a robust process of ritualization. Thinking alongside the work of Catherine Bell, the article aims to show how environmentalism becomes ritualized, and in turn renders a place sacred. The article concludes with the idea that cleaning the lake is both an activity born out of the understanding that Pushkar is paradise and one that simultaneously sets paradise in the making.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'The studies on forest cover change can reveal the status of forests and facilitate for its conservation planning. Idukki is the largest district in the state of Kerala having a total geographical area of The objectives of the present study are to map forest cover in Idukki district using multi-temporal remote sensing data (1975, 1990, 2001 and 2012) and topographical maps (1925), to analyze the trends in deforestation and land use changes. Overall statistics for the period of 1925 indicate that about of the landscape was under forest.

A stratified random sampling scheme was used to survey the distribution and abundance of the species across a 3500 ha area around the village. Data on the physical environment as well as the geographic coordinates of the sample plots were also obtained. A series of canonical analyses was conducted to evaluate the relationships and to identify spatial structures in the species distributions left unexplained by the environmental variables. Four distinct distribution patterns were identified among the species; these were most strongly explained by land-use, the degree of canopy closure and topography. Significant spatial structures, independent of the measured environmental variables, were related to anthropogenic pressure and an edaphic gradient, and the habitat associations of the individual species were described. The results obtained from this case study suggest that land-use dynamics may play a predominant role in structuring inhabited landscapes, and that diversity in distribution patterns and habitat associations will require a combination of spatially explicit management strategies to ensure the local resource base.\\'Abstract: \\'In a number of places, sacred forest sites play an important role in conservation and local livelihoods. Here we examine how Iban hunters and animals alike use sacred forest in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. To determine the relative importance of different sites in hunting, we compare hunting effort, animal species and their numbers encountered by hunters, and encounters and captures in a variety of forest sites including sacred groves. We relate the results to the role of such sites in the overall Iban agroforestry system and in the conservation of forest habitat that professional conservationists deem precious. Such land use practices, while having social and religious origins, may be important for local economic purposes, but they may also be valuable in promoting and enhancing the more global goals of biodiversity conservation.\\'Abstract: \\'Khawa Karpo, in the eastern Himalayas, is a mountain considered sacred throughout Tibet, and is internationally recognized as a global biodiversity hotspot. Numerous areas within this landscape are considered by the indigenous Tibetans of the region, who interact with these sites in ways potentially beneficial to conservation. Our previous remote sensing study indicated that sacred sites are found in habitats with greater species richness, diversity, and endemism than randomly selected non-sacred sites. This study examines the role of sanctity in biodiversity conservation within habitats in the Khawa Karpo region by pairing plots within the same habitats in sacred and non-sacred areas. Understory richness, diversity, cover, and number of useful species are measured; for trees, richness, diversity, cover, and density are measured. Results indicate that within habitats sanctity does not affect understory plant communities; however, within sacred areas trees are larger (p = 0.003) and forests have greater cover (p = 0.003) than non-sacred areas. Our results indicate that, whereas placement of sacred areas and preservation of vegetation cover affects useful plants, biodiversity and endemism, within habitats sacred sites preserve old growth trees and forest structure. In sum, Tibetan sacred sites are ecologically unique and important for conservation on varying scales of landscape, community, and species.\\'Abstract: \\'Deforestation is a primary driver of biotic extinctions in the tropics. The impacts of deforestation in tropical biodiversity hotspots are of particular concern because these regions contain high concentrations of globally endemic species. However, the effects of large-scale deforestation on native biotas within the biodiversity hotspot of Himalaya remain poorly documented. Here we report on an alarming trend of deforestation in the Indian Himalaya and project the likely consequential extinctions of endemic taxa (species and subspecies) by 2100 across a broad range of taxonomic groups, including gymnosperms, angiosperms, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. With the current level of deforestation, by 2100 only about 10% of the land area of the Indian Himalaya will be covered by dense forest (>40% canopy scenario in which almost a quarter of the endemic species could be wiped out, including 366 endemic vascular plant taxa and 35 endemic vertebrate taxa. We also show that inaccurate reporting of forest cover data by governmental institutions can result in underestimations of the biological impacts of deforestation, as well as potential miscalculations in land-use decisions (e.g., the construction of hydroelectric dams). Large-scale conservation efforts, including forest protection and reforestation, are urgently needed to avoid the impending deforestation-driven biodiversity losses in the Himalaya.\\'Abstract: \\'Literature on spot-billed pelican has not been reviewed lately which could provide a critique of the emerging data. We have now chosen it as a key species through which we suggest a conservation action plan which will benefit several waterbird species. The information provided here is scholastic in nature and is meant to focus on aspects that require attention and help plan future work for applied conservation. All known information on this species is brought together in this review which will also provide an update of its biology. Notes on the breeding biology of the species first published in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. So far, 380 works have appeared on the species; of these, 36 contain material reported in earlier works or appeared as papers subsequently. Most appeared as articles in journals, both national and regional, a few international journals, newsletters/bulletins (48.2%), 4 dissertations, 76 reports and 6 popular science articles in magazines. This review on the species will provide an insight into different factors that can be weighed and combined while making a decision in investing resources in species conservation, i.e. importance of the species, level of threat and the time frame over which results are to be achieved.\\'Abstract: \\'Endophytic fungi have been creating a considerable interest and curiosity among researchers since past three decades globally, owing to their recognition as an inexhaustible source of structurally and biologically novel compounds, alternative source of metabolites functionally identical to plant produced metabolites and their ability to impart resistance in host plants against various biotic and abiotic stresses.

A quantification of the effect of Mikania on species richness and factors that contribute to its success would help to understand the invasion success of Mikania in the Western Ghats of India. This study investigated its impact on species richness and factors that contribute to its invasion success. Impact of Mikania on species richness was studied in areas invaded by Mikania and not yet invaded by Mikania by quadrat method. Growth experiments were carried out with Mikania rhizosphere soil and soil treated with Mikania leaf leachate. Chemical characteristics such as electrical conductivity, organic matter, extractable P, total organic N and water-soluble phenolics, and microbial respiration of soil invaded by Mikania and not yet invaded by Mikania were measured. We observed lower species richness in areas invaded by Mikania compared to areas not yet invaded by Mikania. Seedling growth was suppressed in Mikania rhizosphere soil or soil treated with higher levels of Mikania leaf leachate. Higher levels of organic matter, total organic N and water-soluble phenolics, and lower microbial activity were observed in Mikania rhizosphere soil. Soil treated with Mikania leaf leachate has higher amounts of water-soluble phenolics. Mikania invasion appears to reduce plant species richness in the Western Ghats, and discourage seedling growth of certain plant species. Factors that are likely to contribute to Mikania success are its ability to pre-empt light and alter soil chemistry and biochemistry in ways that benefit the species.\\'Abstract: \\'Rapid multiplication of endangered Vanda coerulea Griff ex.

Eighty-five community potted plants were reintroduced into alien forest habitats at Ponmudi and Palode in southern ranges of the Western Ghats. They established at rate.\\'Abstract: \\'Tiger, being a solitary and territorial animal, often tends to move out of protected areas into the surrounding forests. This is especially true in the case of sub-adult animals leading to escalating conflicts and deaths in the surrounding human-dominated landscapes. Unless adequately protected against various human activities, such corridors and surrounding forests will soon disappear, trapping the animals within protected areas with resultant local extinctions. In this paper we ascertain tiger presence, occupancy and numbers in one such partially protected area, the Sathyamangalam forest, located close to better known tiger reserves in India, through non-invasive faecal DNA analysis. Here we highlight the potential of Sathyamangalam as a tiger habitat. Tiger positive faecal samples were considered as evidence to establish occupancy in two different parts of Sathyamangalam, reserve forest and wildlife sanctuary. We collected 103 faecal samples out of which 69 were tiger positive. Species occupancy (psi), was 0.672 with a detection probability of 0.2 in the wildlife sanctuary area; while psi was 0.72 with detection probability of 0.212 in the reserve forest. Further, number of males and females, as determined in our study, was close to the ideal sex ratio in a healthy forest with good prey abundance. This study also highlights the presence of more females in the reserve forest than the wildlife sanctuary possibly indicating lesser disturbance and more prey availability. We recommend that the reserve forest to the north of Sathyamangalam wildlife sanctuary be declared as a tiger reserve. The wildlife sanctuary could serve as a buffer zone between this reserve and Sathyamangalam town which lies to the south of the forest. Proper protection of Sathyamangalam will go a long way in saving the entire landscape and tigers of the Western Ghats of India.\\'Abstract: \\'We surveyed the distribution and status of the long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis umbrosa) in the Nicobar Islands of India. Long-tailed macaques live on 3 islands: Great Nicobar, Little Nicobar and Katchal. There are a total 788 groups. Group size ranged from 25 to 56 individuals with a mean size of 36. Long-tailed macaques are a multimale-multifemale society. Adult males, adult females and immatures constituted 9.7 per cent, 43.2 per cent and 47.1 per cent of the population, respectively. A fairly high ratio of immatures to adult females indicates a healthy population turnover. Vegetation parameters including tree density, canopy cover, canopy height and basal area indicated a still healthful habitats on all the 3 islands. We observed a few threats to the macaques. Measures should be undertaken to ensure survival of the Nicobar subspecies.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Knowledge on the structure and composition of the plant communities has enormous significance in conservation and management of forests. The present study aimed to assess the community attributes, viz., structure, composition and diversity in the moist and dry sal (Shorea robusta) forests in the West Bengal province of India and compare them with the other sal forests of India. The phytosociological data from these forests were quantitatively analysed to work out the species richness, diversity, evenness, dominance, importance value, stand density and the basal area. The analysis showed that plant richness and diversity in moist sal forests of northern West Bengal are higher than the dry sal forests of south-west Bengal; a total of 134 tree (cbh 113 shrub and 230 herb species were recorded in the moist sal forest compared to 35 tree, 41 shrub and 96 herb species in dry sal forest. Papilionaceae was observed to be the dominant family. Dry sal forests had higher tree dominance (0.81) and stand density (1,006 but lower basal area (19.62 while moist sal forest had lower tree dominance (0.18) and stand density (438 but higher basal area Tree species richness and stem density across girth classes in both the types decreased from the smallest to largest trees, while the occurrence rate of species increased with increase in girth class. A t-test showed significant differences in species richness, basal area and the stand density at 95% confidence level in the two forest types. The CCA indicated very low overall match (canonical correlation between the two sets of variables from moist and dry sal types. The differences in these forests could be attributed to the distinct variations in climatic conditions- mainly the rainfall, disturbance regimes and the management practices.\\'Abstract: \\'The mortality rate of herpetofauna due to road accidents in one of the busiest tarmacked metalled roads of Durgapur, an industrial town of West Bengal, India was studied. Road survey for 27 days covering a total distance of 94.5 km was conducted. Within this span of time and the total stretch of road, 354 amphibians belonging to 6 species and 133 reptiles belonging to 11 species were observed to be killed in road-accidents. Among amphibians, Duttaphrynus melanostictus and amongst the reptiles Hemidactylus spp. were killed in highest numbers. The stretch of road under survey passed through different habitat patches agricultural land, human habitation, dumping area, fragmented forest and wetland. On an average, 18 herpetofauna was noted to be killed daily. It was difficult to identify the species as the key characters were missing in the remains in a few cases of road casualties. High road mortality of herpetofauna would surely affect the balance of adjoining ecosystems as well as may be crucial for the local herpetofaunal population attributes.\\'Abstract: \\'Assessment of erosion status of a watershed is an essential prerequisite for integrated watershed management. It not only assists in chalking out suitable soil and water conservation measures to arrest erosion and conserve water but also helps in devising best management practices to enhance biomass production in watersheds. Keeping this in view, the present study has been undertaken by involving geospatial-statistical techniques to determine the critical and priority areas for soil and water conservation in Suketi watershed of the lower Himachal Himalayan region. A novel weighted sum analysis technique was used for ranking each of hydrological unit by obtaining the weightages from various morphometric parameters. This technique offers dynamic, effective and sustainable approach over traditional prioritization methods in which significance of each parameter were considered equally. Considering this approach, sub-watersheds were delineated into low, medium and high priority zones. The results illustrate that about 52 % of sub-watersheds of Suketi watershed are in moderate to high erosion and runoff susceptible zones. Therefore, these potential areas can be considered for preferential soil and water conservation planning. The results obtained from the study will be useful for various stakeholders such as agriculturists, water resource managers, conservation measures planners and decision policy makers for better management practices and decision making. The geospatial-statistical technique can be used for effective estimation of erosion status of watersheds leading to watershed prioritization for taking up soil and water conservation measures in watershed systems. Finally, this technique can be very useful in remote, rugged and inaccessible watersheds with absence of soil erosion and runoff monitoring.\\'Abstract: 28 June 1994 when of rainfall occurred, a huge debris slide took place at Parmachi village in the Varandh Ghat of the Konkan district on the west coast of India. The debris slide resulted in extensive damage to property and killed 20 people in addition to numerous animals. The slide is considered to have occurred due to the development of hydrostatic pressure at the base of colluvial material, such that slope failure took place at the rock/soil interface. In view of the significance of such slides to settlements and highways, it is proposed that a warning system is developed based on a rainfall threshold of in a 24-hour period.\\'Abstract: \\'A key to the management of hillstreams in relation to Fish Species Richness (FSR) and Shannon and Weaver Diversity Index (Shannon and Weaver, 1949.

This paper examines the spatial characteristics and extent of anthropogenic disturbances affecting the mangrove forests of Bhitarkanika Conservation Area situated along the east coast of India by using remotely sensed data and GIS, supplemented with socioeconomic surveys. The study reveals that resource extractions from these forests were considerable despite the protected status. Around 14% of the total fuel wood consumed annually in each of the household came from the mangrove forests of the Park. The patterns of consumption were spatially heterogeneous, controlled by the availability of alternatives, ease of accessibility, presence of markets, human density, and forest composition. The disturbance surface showed 30% of the major forest classes to be under high to very high levels of disturbance especially at easy access points. Besides, the distribution of economically useful species also determined the degree of disturbance. Resource use surfaces clearly identified the biotic pressure zones with respect to specific mangrove use and could be combined with the disturbance regime map to prioritize areas for mangrove restoration.\\'Abstract: \\'A comparative study of butterfly communities in 15 urban/suburban remnants of tropical semideciduous forest in Campinas Paulo state, SE Brazil; with areas from 1.0 to and widely varying histories and environments, shows that the most significant factors, besides area and sampling time, distinguishing the sites and influencing their diversity species) and composition are connectivity, permanent water, vegetation, flowers, and human impact (negative, including pollution). The diversified Nymphalidae butterflies species) and especially two fermented-bait-attracted groups (Satyrinae, species, and Biblidini, species), are among the more useful indicators of the quality and diversity of the environments in these fragments. Effective conservation of butterfly communities in tropical cities may be achieved by maintenance of arboreal green corridors along streets and watercourses between moderately large humid areas, not near to the most built-up or polluted city centre(s), and the inclusion within these areas of ponds or streams, diversified native forest, and open vegetation including abundant nectar-rich flowers.\\'Abstract: \\'Assessment of diversity in cultivated and wild useful Crotalaria L. distributed in different phytogeographical regions of India was made.

Between-group encounters in primates range from avoidance to fatally aggressive. The prevailing hypotheses explain such encounters as mate defense strategy by males and resource defense strategy by females. However, the rate and nature of between-group encounters may also be influenced by habitat and demographic characteristics. We studied the effect of forest fragment size on group encounters in lion-tailed macaques in the Western Ghats of southern India. The encounter rate decreased as the fragment size increased. Group density and home range overlap correlated positively with the encounter rate. The aggressive encounters were more in the relatively medium-sized fragment where the observed frequency of between-group encounters was higher than the expected frequency than in the small fragment and the large forest complex. Together, these results indicate a complex pattern of effects of fragment size on between-group encounters in primates.\\'Abstract: \\'The paper initially outlines selected uncertainties influencing climate change and their linkages with hydrology which have led to only a small section of the hydrological community (divided into 2 groups) being pro-active. Due to the foregoing uncertainties, the strategy adopted in this paper will be to focus on the principal conclusions from controlled experimental catchment studies and related process hydrology connected with land-use change arising from anthropogenic influences. The underlying philosophy is that even major natural disruptions to climate cause ecohydrological shifts in the response of landscapes and such changes may be indicated from recent hydrology research evaluating man-made impacts. The paper assesses the existing conclusions from hydrological work undertaken in both the closed forests of the humid tropics and the open forests of the tropical semi-arid regions based mostly from experimentation in headwater catchments. Such studies are concerned with the hydrological responses to the impacts of forest conversion on the change in total water yield and, in turn, the processes connected with dry weather flow (delayed flow) and storm runoff (quickflow). By taking the above approach, possible hydrological changes to climate change will be inferred, including some consideration given the outputs from atmospheric General Circulation Models (GCMs) using the Amazon basin as an example.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Lichens are a good example of the virtues of simplicity and cooperation.

Country-by-country summaries on in situ crop wild relatives conservation activities are presented, and recommendations are made for future action. Principal recommendations include of appropriate taxa as crop wild relatives in botanical and conservation databases, undertaking gap analyses to locate crop wild relatives hotspots, and enhancing cooperation between the plant genetic resources and plant conservation communities.\\'Abstract: \\' Vateria indica (Dipterocarpaceae) is an economically and ecologically important canopy tree endemic to the Western Ghats, India. The species has undergone extensive habitat loss and overexploitation and is therefore listed as on the 2012 IUCN Red List. We developed ten polymorphic microsatellite loci for V. indica. In addition, we confirm cross amplification and variation in two loci isolated from the closely related but geographically disjunct species Vateriopsis seychellarum, previously published by Finger et al. Conserv Genet Resour, 2 (2010). The twelve microsatellite primers screened on 48 adult samples of V. indica had alleles per locus (mean of 8.5 per locus) with an average polymorphic information content of 0.64 across loci. Expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.44 to 0.84. These markers will enable us to quantify population genetic diversity in habitat fragments and to study fine scale spatial genetic structure and contemporary gene flow.\\'Abstract: \\'Deforestation studies have attracted considerable attention over the past two decades. Analyses of local deforestation examine the significance of numerous explanatory variables for the extraction of forest products. This study distinguishes among the explanatory variables as household-specific and site-specific, and argues for in-depth analysis of household-specific variables. It examines the role of household size, income, and education on firewood extraction and beedi-making in the Western Ghats of India, a hotspot of biodiversity. The study documents the incidence of these livelihoods, investigates the interaction among the three variables, and uses logistic regression models to determine the exact probability for the livelihoods. Two novel features of the study include analysis of wood and non-wood extraction through a single dataset and determination of model by the data. The results show high dependency of households on forest-based livelihoods, situations when the probability of livelihoods changes substantially, and non-parallel trends for household dependency. The study suggests the role of household-specific variables as the agents of motivation and persistence for forest-based livelihoods and presents a hypothesis about the critical size of household in forest dependency. The study recommends four of ecosystem services, rise in income, migration and mobility, and environmental promote sustainable livelihoods.\\'Abstract: \\'This study aims to determine leaf litter preference, consumption rate, growth rate, food conversion efficiency, and quality of fecal pellets of two endemic pill millipedes (Arthrosphaera dalyi and Arthrosphaera davisoni) of the Western Ghats of India by laboratory microcosm experiments. Among seven combinations of three plantation leaf litters offered in 4-day trial, top three preferred combinations were selected for 4-week trial. In 4-week trial, preference of mixed litter diet was higher than single litter diet, which resulted in enhanced growth as well as food conversion efficiency of millipedes. Among Hopea , Pongamia , and Areca litters, A. dalyi preferred and its consumption was significantly correlated with contents of organic carbon and nitrogen while growth rate with phosphorus content and food conversion efficiency with contents of organic carbon and calcium Among Areca , Elettaria , and Coffea litters,                        was most preferred by A. davisoni, which was significantly correlated with organic carbon content and food conversion efficiency with calcium content The food conversion efficiency, however, was the highest in millipedes fed with Areca Elettaria. The present study demonstrated increased nitrogen and phosphorus contents and decreased phenolic content and C/N ratio in fecal pellets of pill millipedes fed with plantation litter, and thus, these millipedes play an important role in leaf litter mineralization and soil enrichment in plantations Western Ghats.\\'Abstract: \\'Agroforestry system has the enormous capacity to achieve social, economic, and environmental goals by optimizing land productivity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the land potentiality in India for agroforestry based on FAO land suitability criteria utilizing various land, soil, climate, and topographic themes. This was achieved in GIS Domain by integrating various thematic layers scientifically. The analysis of land potentiality in India for agroforestry suitability reveals 32.8% as highly suitable (S1), 40.4% moderately suitable (S2), 11.7% marginally suitable (S3), and 9.1% not suitable (NS). About 52% of land of India is under the cropland category. In addition, it revealed that the 46% of these cropland areas fall into high agroforestry suitable category and provide huge opportunity for harnessing agroforestry practices. Furthermore, agroforestry suitability mapping in broad ecosystem and in different agroecological regions will assist various projects in India at the regional level. Such results will also boost the various objectives of the National Agroforestry Policy (2014, http://www.cafri.res.in/NAF_Policy.pdf) and policymakers of India where they need to extend it. The potential of geospatial technology can be exploited in the field of agroforestry for the benefit of rural poor people/farmers by ensuring food and ecological security, resilience in livelihoods, and can sustain extreme weather events such as droughts and climate change impact. Such type of research can be replicated in India at village level (local level) to state level (regional level) utilizing the significant themes which affect the agroforestry suitability. This will certainly fetch better results on ground and will significantly assist the management programs.\\'Abstract: \\'A study was conducted to examine the distribution pattern of four rhizomatous medicinal and aromatic plant species (MAPs) viz., Angelica glauca, Pleurospermum angelicoides, Rheum emodi and Arnebia benthamii in different forest stands in Central Himalaya. Results show that A. glauca and P. angelicoides had a higher (50%) frequency at Chipkoan, Garpak and Phagati forest, R. emodi had a higher (60%) frequency at Rishikund, Suki and Himtoli, and A. benthamii had a higher (70%) frequency at Suki and Khambdhar The densities of A. glauca (0.6 and P. angelicoides (0.5 were higher at Chipkoan and Garpak sites than at other micro-sites, while densities of R. emodi (0.8 and A. benthamii (1.0 were higher at Suki and Khambdhar sites.

For the four studied species, A. glauca showed a contagious distribution, P. angelicoides and R. emodi showed the random and A. benthamii showed the regular type of distribution.\\'Abstract: \\'There is enough evidence to show that the forest biomass has decreased significantly in the Indian Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh. The government has responded through restrictive measures to check this decline. Using tree biomass as proxy for degradation, we assessed the current state of biomass within dominant land use types and examined its implications for sustainability. The highest above-ground mean tree biomass density of 1158 was recorded for the reserved forest followed by 728, 13, 11, 8, 5 and 3 in the protected forest, fallow land, cultivated-unirrigated land, grassland, orchard land and cultivated-irrigated land respectively. Of the total accessible biomass, only 0.31% was extracted annually by the local people for fuel, fodder and other uses. Though, the current level of extraction may be sustainable in the short run, insufficient regeneration is observed for long term sustainability. Forest biomass production was simulated for the next 30 years with a logistic growth model and the relative significance of input variables in influencing system behaviour was analysed through sensitivity analysis. The model results highlighted the declining forest resources in the long run. Positive response through appropriate government policies can, however, change the scenario for the better.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Soil depth generally varies in mountainous regions in rather complex ways. Conventional soil survey methods for evaluating the soil depth in mountainous and hilly regions require a lot of time, effort and consequently relatively large budget to perform. This study was conducted to explore the relationships between soil depth and topographic attributes in a hilly region in western Iran. For this, one hundred sampling points were selected using randomly stratified methodology, and considering all geomorphic surfaces including summit, shoulder, backslope, footslope and toeslope; and soil depth was actually measured. Eleven primary and secondary topographic attributes were derived from the digital elevation model (DEM) at the study area. The result of multiple linear regression indicated that slope, wetness index, catchment area and sediment transport index, which were included in the model, could explain about 76 % of total variability in soil depth at the selected site. This proposed approach may be applicable to other hilly regions in the semi-arid areas at a larger scale.\\'Abstract: \\'Tikal: Paleoecology of an Ancient Maya City. Lentz, David L., Nicholas P.

About 395 species, 250 genera, and 108 families comprising pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms were found in the groves. Orchidaceae, Rubiaceae, Asteraceae and Lauraceae were dominant families and Ficus was the largest genus, with nine species. About 160 tree species were distributed in canopy, subcanopy and under canopy strata of the forest. Concentration of tropical and temperate elements of the neighbouring Sino-Himalayan and Burma-Malayan regions, and endemic (54 species), rare (31 species) and primitive taxa (38 species) due to favourable climatic conditions and prolonged protection have contributed to the high species richness of the groves. Their better management and protection is important for the conservation of plant diversity in the region and also for the benefit of indigenous tribes of the state.\\'Abstract: \\'Forests are subjected to stress from climatic and non-climatic sources. In this study, we have reported the results of inherent, as well as climate change driven vulnerability assessments for Indian forests. To assess inherent vulnerability of forests under current climate, we have used four indicators, namely biological richness, disturbance index, canopy cover, and slope. The assessment is presented as spatial profile of inherent vulnerability in low, medium, high and very high vulnerability classes. Fourty percent forest grid points in India show high or very high inherent vulnerability. Plantation forests show higher inherent vulnerability than natural forests. We assess the climate change driven vulnerability by combining the results of inherent vulnerability assessment with the climate change impact projections simulated by the Integrated Biosphere Simulator dynamic global vegetation model. While 46% forest grid points show high, very high, or extremely high vulnerability under future climate in the short term (2030s) under both representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5, such grid points are 49 and 54%, respectively, in the long term (2080s). Generally, forests in the higher rainfall zones show lower vulnerability as compared to drier forests under future climate. Minimizing anthropogenic disturbance and conserving biodiversity can potentially reduce forest vulnerability under climate change. For disturbed forests and plantations, adaptive management aimed at forest restoration is necessary to build long-term resilience.\\'Abstract: \\'Patterns of feeding ecology among the living macaques conform poorly with recognized phyletic distinctions within the genus because there is an important ecological division which cross-cuts phyletic groupings. This division, between weed species and non-weed species, is based on the differing abilities of macaques to tolerate and even prosper in close association with human settlements. Based on available information about their ecology in the wild, we tentatively assign macaque species to these two categories. Finally, we consider the implications of our argument for scenarios of the initial spread of the macaques.\\'Abstract: \\'Western Ghats of India is recognized as one of the 12 mega diversity regions of the world and is the hot spot for unrevealed microbial diversity.

Nine pectinolytic clones with the ability to degrade citrus pectin were isolated based on function based screening of the library. Sequence analysis of revealed that it contained GH family 28 domain (pfam00295) belonging to polygalacturonase superfamily (PLN03003). Its amino acid sequence analysis showed identity to the other well-characterized polygalacturonases. Molecular modeling of pg_4 revealed that it comprised of three right handed-parallel sheets, one anti-parallel sheet and one helix with three conserved catalytic residue D 2263, D 284-85 and H 312 at the C terminal end.

Pseudogenes amplified in a portion of the species limited the utility of the D-loop region. ABGD analysis, NJ, ML, and MP methods and genetic distance using COI data revealed concordant species delimiting patterns.

It is imperative to assess its trend and the rates at which it is occurring. The changes will have long-lasting impact on regional climate and in turn on biodiversity. In North-East India, one of the recognized global biodiversity hotspots, approximately 30% of total forest cover is under pressure of rapid land use changes. This region harbors variety of rare and endemic species of flora and fauna. It also has a strong bearing on regional climatic conditions. Extensive shifting cultivation, compounded by increasing population pressure and demands for agriculture land are the prime drivers in addition to other proximate drivers of deforestation. It is therefore of prime concern to analyse forest cover changes in the region, assess rate of change and extent and to identify the areas, which show repetitive changes. We analyzed forest cover maps from six temporal datasets based on satellite data interpretation, converted to geospatial database since 1972 till 1999. The states of Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura show highest changes in forest cover. Arunachal Pradesh shows least dynamic areas and maintains a good forest cover owing to its topographical inaccessibility in some areas. The present study reports the forest cover changes in the region using geospatial analysis and analyse them to devise proper management strategies.\\'Abstract: \\'In situ measurements of maximum horizontal stress (SHmax) in the Indian subcontinent are limited and do not present regional trends of intraplate stress orientation. The observed orientations of SHmax vary considerably and often differ from the plate velocity direction. We have simulated orientation and magnitude of SHmax through finite element modeling incorporating heterogeneities in elastic property of the Indian continent and plain stress approximation to understand the variability of SHmax. Four different scenarios are tested in simulation: (1) homogeneous plate with fixed plate boundary (2) homogeneous plate with boundary forces (3) heterogeneous plate with fixed boundary (4) heterogeneous plate with boundary forces. The estimated orientation and magnitude of SHmax with a heterogeneous plate with boundary forces in the Himalayan region and an eastern plate boundary comprising the Indo-Burmese arc and Andaman subduction zone are consistent with measured maximum horizontal stress. This study suggests that plate boundary force varies along the northern Indian plate margin and also provides a constraint on the intraplate stress field in the Indian subcontinent.\\'Abstract: \\'A procedure for the regeneration of complete plantlets of Tylophora indica from cultured leaf callus via somatic embryogenesis is described.

Random amplified polymorphic, DNA (RAPD) analysis was carried out using 20 arbitrary oligonucleotides. The amplification products were monomorphic among all the plants revealing the genetic homogeneity and true-to-type nature of the regenerants.\\'Abstract: \\'Despite increasing recognition of the role spatial pattern can play in ecosystem function, few studies have quantified spatial heterogeneity in savanna ecosystems. The spatial distribution of herbaceous biomass and species composition was measured across three scales in a semi-arid savanna in central Kenya, and patterns were related to environmental variables at different scales. Herbaceous biomass declined across a rainfall gradient and from upper to lower topographic positions, but variation within a site (across m) was similar in magnitude to among-site variation associated with rainfall and topography. Geostatistical analyses showed that patchiness at scales of m explained 20% of total variation in herbaceous biomass. This pattern arose from the presence of both diameter patches containing high herbaceous biomass (> 170 g and diameter patches characterized by nearly bare soil surfaces (< 40 g Patch structure was contingent on topography, with larger bare patches at ridgeline and upper hillslope positions. Grass species distributions showed the greatest degree of patch structure and species turnover across distances of m. Additional community variation was associated with topography, with minimal variation in species composition across the rainfall gradient. Pattern diversity significantly exceeded levels reported for four other grassland ecosystems, suggesting fundamental differences in local processes generating spatial pattern. It is hypothesized that heterogeneously distributed grazing pressure, interacting with the distribution of shrub canopies, is an important factor generating such high levels of small-scale patch structure in this savanna.\\'Abstract: \\'A survey was conducted in 17 selectedthaluks (revenue sub-divisions) of Kerala state to elucidate the floristic structure, composition and the extent of similarities and diversities in the composition of homegardens of Kerala, with particular reference to small (below 0.4 ha), medium (0.5 to 2 ha) and large (>2.0 ha) holding size categories. Besides attempts wer also made to characterize the potential of homegardens to supply commercial timber and fuelwood.

In this study, the dynamical characteristics of systematic errors of the NCUM model at horizontal resolution during the Indian summer monsoon (July and August 2017) are examined. It is found that the model has problem in maintaining the monsoon circulation and it weakens the monsoon by weakening the divergent winds over the Indian region. The model has a large spin up in global mean precipitation and evaporation from day-1 to day-3. In addition to the spin up problem, the model loses mass as the forecast length increases from day-1 to day-10. However, the pressure over India increases in forecasts from day-3 up to day-10. An anticyclonic circulation error over north Arabian Sea and adjoining region reduces moisture transport from the sea to the Indian land areas. The model has systematic tendency to forecast less rain as the forecast length increases. Differences between the ERA-Interim and the NCUM analysis in circulation and moisture parameters indicate uncertainties in the initial conditions and imbalance in moisture and divergence. Relationship between circulation errors and rainfall errors over a river basin (Mahanadi basin in Odisha) was studied. There is no linear relation between divergent or rotational components of wind errors and rainfall errors in forecasts over this basin. Even with a very small error in wind, the rainfall error could be as large as or more in the basin.\\'Abstract: \\'The mass-extinction episode underway is largely centred on tropical forests, insofar as they contain at least half of all species and they are being depleted faster than any other biome. But species distributions and depletion patterns are anything but uniform throughout the biome. This paper identifies 10 areas that, a) are characterised by exceptional concentrations of species with high levels of endemism and b) are experiencing unusually rapid rates of depletion. While these \"hotspot\" areas comprise less than 3.5 percent of remaining primary forests, they harbour over 34 000 endemic plant species (27 percent of all plant species in tropical forests and 13 percent of all plant species worldwide). They also feature 700 000 endemic animal species and possibly several times more. Unfortunately, they appear likely to lose 90 percent of their forest cover as soon as the end of the century or shortly thereafter, causing the extinction of almost 7 percent of plant species and at least a similar proportion of animal species, this occurring in only 0.2 percent of land surface. By concentrating on such areas where needs are greatestand where the pay-off from safeguard measures would also be greatest, conservationists can engage in a more systematised response to the challenge of largescale extinctions impending in tropical forests.\\'Abstract: \\'A plankton sample from Lake Devikulam, a temperate, high-altitude lake in the Western Ghat range, Kerala state, Southern India contained 24 rotifer species. Its interest lies in the fact that, beside widespread eurythermic, warm-water and one Paleotropical species, one or two new, possibly endemic species were found. The geographic and climatologic isolation of the temperate habitats of the Western Ghats may account for this peculiar taxocoenosis. Polyarthra indica sp. n. is described. The trophi morphology of three Polyarthra species is documented using scanning electron microscopy and its relevance to the taxonomy of Polyarthra discussed.\\'neglected. We provide a country-wide assessment of Indian river ecosystems in order to identify and prioritize areas for protection and restoration of freshwater fish fauna. Using various biodiversity and anthropogenic attributes, coupled with tools of ecological modeling, we delineated areas for fish fauna conservation and restoration in the 20 major river basins of India. To do this, we used prioritization analyses and reserve selection algorithms to derive conservation value index (CVI) and vulnerability index (VI) of the river basins. CVI was estimated using endemicity, rarity, conservation value, and taxonomic singularity, while VI was estimated using a disturbance index derived from percent geographic area of the basin under human settlements, human population density, predominant land use, and total number of exotic fish species in each basin. The two indices, CVI and VI, were converted into geo-referenced maps, and each map was super-imposed onto species richness and forest cover maps, respectively. After superimposition, areas with high CVI and low VI shade intensities were delineated for conservation, while areas with high CVI and high VI shade intensities were demarcated for restoration. In view of the importance of freshwater fish for human livelihoods and consumption, and ecosystems of rivers, we call for urgent attention to the conservation of their fish fauna along with restoration of their degraded habitats.\\'Abstract: \\'There are many vanishing cultures that possess a wealth of knowledge on the medicinal utility of plants. The Malasars of Dravidian Tamils are an indigenous society occupying the forests of the Western Ghats, South India. They are known to be exceptional healers and keepers of traditional aboriginal knowledge (TAK) of the flora in the Velliangiri holy hills. In fact, their expertise is well known throughout India as evidenced by the thousands of pilgrims that go to the Velliangiri holy hills for healing every year. Our research is the first detailed study of medicinal plants in India that considers variation in TAK among informants using a quantitative consensus analysis. A total of 95 species belonging to 50 families were identified for medicinal and general health purposes. For each species the botanical name, family, local name, parts used, summary of mode of preparation, administration and curing are provided. The consensus analysis revealed a high level of agreement among the informants usage of a particular plant at a local scale. The average consensus index value of an informant was FIC > 0.71, and over 0.80 for some ailments such as respiratory and jaundice. Some of the more common problems faced by the Malasars were gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory illness, dermatological problems and simple illness such as fever, cough, cold, wounds and bites from poisonous animals. We also discovered several new ethnotaxa that have considerable medicinal utility. This study supports claims that the Malasars possess a rich TAK of medicinal plants and that many aboriginals and mainstream people (pilgrims) utilize medicinal plants of the Velliangiri holy hills. Unfortunately, the younger generation of Malasars are not embracing TAK as they tend to migrate towards lucrative jobs in more developed urban areas. Our research sheds some light on a traditional culture that believes that a healthy lifestyle is founded on a healthy environment and we suggest that TAK such as that of the Malasars may serve toward a global lifestyle of health and environmental sustainability.\\'Abstract: \\'The proposed work describes a protocol for high-frequency in vitro regeneration through nodal segments and shoot tips in Decalepsis arayalpathra, a critically endangered medicinal liana of the Western Ghats. Nodal segments were more responsive than shoot tips in terms of shoot proliferation. Murashige and (MS) basal medium supplemented with 5.0 6-benzyladenine (BA) was optimum for shoot initiation through both the explants. Among different combinations of plant growth regulators and growth additive screened, MS medium added with 5.0 BA + 0.5 indole-3-acetic acid + 20.0 adenine sulphate effectuated the highest response: 11.8 shoots per nodal segment and 5.5 shoots per shoot tip with mean shoot length of 9.2 and 4.8 cm, respectively. Half-strength MS medium with 2.5 acetic acid was optimum for in vitro root induction. The plantlets with the well developed shoot and root were acclimatized in with 92 % survival rate in the field conditions. During acclimatization, chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate were gradually changed in dependence of formation of new leaves. Further, the changes in activities of antioxidant enzymes, i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR) as well as activity of carbonic anhydrase were also observed: a continuous rise in SOD activity, but a rise and fall in the activities of CAT, APX, and GR were also noticed. Maximum fresh mass (3.1 g plant-1), dry mass (0.35 g plant-1) of roots and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde content of 9.22 cm-3(root extract) were recorded after 8 weeks of acclimatization.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'The Millennium Seed Bank (MSB) Partnership, developed and managed by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (RBG Kew), conserves propagules primarily from orthodox seed-bearing wild vascular plants. It is the largest ex situ conservation programme in the world, currently involving 96 countries and territories. Where possible, seeds are collected and conserved in the country of origin with duplicates being sent to RBG MSB for storage. In this paper we assess the conservation value of the germplasm stored at the MSB using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The MSB holdings represent a high quality, rich biological resource. Substantial and unique taxonomic diversity exists amongst the collections, representing 365 families, 5813 genera, 36,975 species and 39,669 taxa conserved. The collections cover a wide geographic range, originating from 189 countries and territories, representing all nine bio-geographic regions and all 35 biodiversity hotspots. The collections possess significant natural capital and population value: 32% of taxa, representing 49% of collections, have at least one identified use to humans; and 74% of taxa, representing 78% of collections, are either endemic, endangered (nationally or globally) and/or have an economic, ecological, social, cultural or scientific value. While 10% of taxa, representing of collections, are either extinct, rare or vulnerable to extinction at the global and/or national level, 20% of taxa, representing 13% collections, are endemic at the country or territory scale. Over the 17-year period since 2000 at least 11,182 seed samples, representing 12% of taxa and 8% of collections, have been distributed globally for conservation, research, education and display. This analysis highlighted collection gaps in MSB holdings in relation to their geographic representativeness, the taxonomic diversity of large families and genera of angiosperms, and coverage of threatened taxa. Further analysis across the entire MSB Partnership is required to underpin future collection activities and maximize the usefulness of collections.\\'Abstract: \\'Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to assess the genetic diversity of 14 individuals belonging to 7 populations of Coscinium fenestratum (Gaertn.) Colebr. (Menispermaceae). 18 decamer primers used for the analysis generated 99 scorable bands of which 79 were found to be polymorphic. Coefficient of similarity ranged from 0.6604 to 0.9809. Variation within population was slightly higher than between populations. Similarity between individuals within and between populations was found. Dendrogram was obtained by using unwieghed pair-group method analysis (UPGMA). Distinct accession also exhibited higher percentage of medicinally active compound.\\'Abstract: \"Water is one of the basic resources of mankind and is vital to all forms of life. Although water is abundant covering 3/4 of the earth, yet it is a scarce resource; its universal use and the fact that only 3% is drinkable, makes its utilization and conservation, a most complicated problem, which has received inadequate attention. Water is like Shiva; it can create, preserve and destory. It is man\\'s greatest friend and for; while it sustains life, it is a killer also. Water resources are limited but the demand for water continues to rise steeply, making the need most urgent for an efficient planning and implementation of programme of water resource appraisal, development, conservation and management.\"Abstract: \\'In a diverse country like India first hand observations of diversity of life forms could provide an interesting focus and purpose to the teaching of biology. In the process it could generate information of great relevance to monitor biodiversity in order to assess the efficacy of our conservation efforts. The endeavour of organizing such observations into a countrywide biodiversity information system could help catalyze our transition to the information age.\\'Abstract: \\'Fascinating and grand, with curious beaks and breeding habits, hornbills are a delight. In forest types ranging from open savannah to rainforest across Africa and Asia, they occupy the pride of place among birds and play a pivotal role as mutualistic frugivores and seed dispersers of various trees. Due to the impact of humans on hornbills and their habitats, most species are now endangered. Fortunately, there has been some success in recent conservation efforts to save these magnificent forest flagships.\\'Abstract: \\'Siruvani watershed with a surface area of (20,554 hectare), forming a part of the Western Ghats in Attapady valley, Kerala, was chosen for testing RUSLE methodology in conjunction with remote sensing and GIS for soil loss prediction and identifying areas with high erosion potential. The RUSLE factors (R, K, LS, C and P) were computed from local rainfall, topographic, soil classification and remote sensing data. This study proved that the integration of soil erosion models with GIS and remote sensing is a simple and effective tool for mapping and quantifying areas and rates of soil erosion for the development of better soil conservation plans. The resultant map of annual soil erosion shows a maximum soil loss of and the computations suggest that about only 5.76% (1,184 hectares) of the area comes under the severe soil erosion zone followed by the high-erosion zone (11.50% of the total area). The dominant high soil erosion areas are located in the central and southern portion of the watershed and it is attributed to the shifting cultivation, and forest degradation along with the combined effect of K, LS and C factor. The RUSLE model in combination with GIS and remote sensing techniques also enables the assessment of pixel based soil erosion rate.\\'Abstract: \\'From 1983, there have been three decades of the application and development of radio telemetry for wildlife studies in India. In this article, we review 82 studies from India, covering 47 species from four taxonomic classes. We examine and discuss the trends in the selection of study species, habitats and objectives of radio-telemetry studies and the functional success of radio collars and tags. A strong bias for study species and study region is observed and researchers generally tend not to look beyond the traditional research questions. Habitats that are difficult to access, such as the Trans-Himalayas, the Himalayas and north-eastern India, are overlooked. Most of the studies aimed to infer primary information only, such as home range, migration and movement patterns and habitat preference (53.7%, 47.6% and 28.1% studies, respectively). We expect these trends to change with time as the development of technology allows researchers to explore further. We investigated the tracking histories of 483 animals and the records of 496 radio collars or tags, but detailed information could be acquired for only 330 collars or tags. Of the collars, 49% malfunctioned before the end of their anticipated life due to a variety of reasons, early battery drainage being the prevalent cause. The performance of different technologies and collar manufacturers was also analysed but the small sample size was an issue for most of the cases. Argos-based collars and tags generally failed to record most of the locations precisely and failed to transmit them successfully. Issues with permissions and capturing animals for tagging, particular to India, are also discussed. A uniform and centralized system for granting permissions and guidelines for capturing and handling animals would be beneficial to future telemetry studies.\\'Abstract: \\'Arunachal Pradesh, the easternmost part of India, is endowed with diverse natural resources and inhabited by a variety of ethnic groups that have developed skills to exploit the biotic resources of the region for food and medicines. Information on animals and animal parts as components of folk remedies used by local healers and village headmen of the Nyishi and Galo tribes in their respective West Siang and Subansiri districts were obtained through interviews and structured questionnaires. Of a total of 36 vertebrate species used in treatments of ailments and diseases, mammals comprised 50%; they were followed by birds (22%), fishes (17%), reptiles (8%) and amphibians (3%). Approximately 20 common complaints of humans as well as foot and mouth disease of cattle were targets of zootherapies. Most commonly treated were fevers, body aches and pains, tuberculosis, malaria, wounds and burns, typhoid, smallpox, dysentery and diarrhoea, jaundice, and early pregnancy pains. Very few domestic animal species (e.g., goat and cattle) were used zootherapeutically. More frequently it was wild animals, including endangered or protective species like hornbill, pangolin, clouded leopard, tiger, bear, and wolf, whose various parts were either used in folk remedies or as food. Some of the animal-based traditional medicines or animal parts were sold at local markets, where they had to compete with modern, western pharmaceuticals. To record, document, analyze and test the animal-derived local medicines before they become replaced by western products is one challenge; to protect the already dwindling populations of certain wild animal species used as a resource for the traditional animal-derived remedies, is another.\\'Abstract: \\'The rain shadow regions requisite a comprehensive watershed development and management plan for sustainable water resources management. The Pambar River Basin (PRB) lies on the rain shadow region of the southern Western Ghats, India, where climate showed marked intra-basin variation. A morphometric analysis was done to evaluate the drainage characteristics of PRB using topographical maps and digital elevation data. PRB was divided into eighteen 4th order basins (SB1-SB18), distributed along various climatic gradients. Lower order streams mostly dominate PRB and drainage pattern is a function of relief and structure. The terrain is highly dissected and prone to soil erosion during heavy storms and the elongated shape of PRB enables easier flood management. The influence of climate on drainage characteristics was evidently emphasized in basin morphometry. Four distinctively different classes were identified based on the morphometric similarities. The significance of morphometric analysis on the hydrological characterization is discussed and the relevance of the present study in water harvesting has been explicated.\\'Abstract: \\'Water demand in India is growing due to its increasing population, economic growth and urbanization. Consequently, knowledge of interdependencies of large-scale hydrometeorological processes is crucial for efficient water resources management. Estimates of Groundwater (GW) derived from Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) data provided by Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission along with various other satellite observations and model estimates now facilitates such investigations. In an attempt which is first of its kind in India, this study proposes Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based spatiotemporal analysis of Precipitation (P), Evapotranspiration (ET), Surface Soil Moisture (SSM), Root Zone Soil Moisture (RZSM), TWS and GW to understand such interdependencies at intra- and interannual time scales. Results indicate that of the total variability is explained by the first 6 ICs of all the variables, analyzed for a period The Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) is the causative-factor of the first component describing of the total variability. The phase difference between all seasonal components of P and that of RZSM and ET is a month whereas it is between the seasonal components of P and that of SSM, TWS and GW. ET is observed to be largely dependent on RZSM while GW appears as the major component of TWS. GW and TWS trends of opposite nature were observed in northern and southern part of India caused by inter-annual rainfall variability. These findings when incorporated in modelling frameworks would improve forecasts resulting in better water management.\\'Abstract: \\'Teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) is considered to be an extraordinarily durable building timber with a worldwide reputation. Its widespread use has entailed the over-exploitation of natural forests and a large reduction in natural diversity. Fifteen microsatellite markers were used to study the genetic variability and structure of 166 teak trees distributed over the whole natural area of teak. Analysis showed that in the teak natural area there were four main centers of genetic variability. Two clusters were in India and could be considered as main centers of genetic diversity in teak. The third cluster mainly consisting of populations in Thailand and Laos was genetically very distinct from the Indian populations but presented only half as much allelic variability. A fourth cluster from Central Laos showed even less genetic variability. The use of SSR markers for conservation of teak forest diversity is discussed.\\'Abstract: \\'We studied the ranging pattern of the wild black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) at Xiaochangdu, Tibet from June 2003 to March 2005. Using the map grid cell method, the group home range were 16.75 km2 in summer, 10.50 km2 in winter, and 21.25 km2 total over two years. The daily travel length (DTL) averaged 765 m with a range of m. The results showed that DTL in winter was significantly shorter than those of in summer and spring. Temperature, rainfall, food availability, and human disturbance correlated positively with DTL. According to the maximum observed group size and estimated total home range, population density and biomass of R. bieti were 9.1 individuals/km2 and 88.6 kg/km2, respectively. The temporal and spatial variations of food resources and patterns of human disturbance largely determine the ranging behavior of R. bieti at Xiaochangdu.\\'Abstract: \\'An efficient protocol was developed for short-term storage and conservation of a woody medicinal climber, Decalepis hamiltonii, using encapsulated nodal segments. The encapsulation of nodal segments was significantly affected by the concentrations of sodium alginate (Na-alginate) and calcium chloride A gelling matrix of Na-alginate and was found most suitable for the production of ideal Ca-alginate beads. Maximum shoot re-growth was recorded on Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium supplemented with 6-benzyladenine (BA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and adenine-sulphate (ADS). Microshoots, recovered from encapsulated nodal segments (capsule) were best rooted on half-strength MS medium containing acetic acid (NAA). Complete plantlets (with shoot and root) were successfully acclimatized and established in field where they grew well without any detectable variation.\\'Abstract: \\'Homegardens are recognized worldwide as sustainable agroforestry systems that are repositories of species and genetic diversity. Species diversity and composition of homegardens are influenced by a number of environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural factors. The present study examines the tree species diversity in the homegardens of different cultural groups of Barak Valley, Assam, Northeast India. Complete enumeration was done for diversity analysis in 181 homegardens from 38 villages in the three districts of the Valley. Factors affecting plant diversity were analyzed, and the floristic composition of the homegardens was found to vary with garden size, ethnicity of the homegarden owners, and geographical parameters such as location and altitude. Results indicate high plant diversity, with a total of 161 tree species identified from 47 families. Tea garden labor communities were comparatively found to hold more diversity in their homegardens. Similarity and cluster analysis revealed the distinctness of the majority of the homegardens, and seven groups of homegardens with very low distance were revealed. Homegardens were also found to maintain considerable conservation value as repositories of many underutilized, wild, and rare plant species. Biodiversity conservation in the homegardens was found to be linked to the multiple values of the different plant species to the homegardeners and further highlight the concept of the through approach. For the preservation of such traditional agroforestry systems, which also have the potential to provide options for adaptation to climate change, proper documentation of traditional knowledge concerning the different plant species and the human-nature interaction in the homegardens is necessary before such systems are completely lost.\\'Abstract: \\'Spiders are omnipresent, occurring in almost all terrestrial habitats. They are generalist predators and important for conservation biocontrol in agricultural fields, helping to reduce pesticide applications. In this study, we examined how spider families and spider web types in rice fields are related to local and landscape management. Samples were taken in differently managed rice fields adjoining either homegarden polycultures or banana monocultures. Furthermore, landscape structure, prey abundance, herb richness and cover were taken into account. The results showed that prey availability explained most of the variation in spiders and their abundance, indicating that spiders in the rice fields can potentially contribute to pest control. Adjacent habitat had no effect on the spider populations, but maintaining fallow fields in the surrounding landscape seems to be a useful measure to promote Erigoninae in rice fields. There was no evidence that local management practices such as fertiliser and pesticide use had an impact on spider families, which appeared to be due to the low level of these inputs. Spider web sampling can complement spider sampling as it detects spiders hidden at the base of the rice tillers, which are likely to be missed by sweep netting. Additionally, tetragnathid webs are easy to observe and thus can be used as an indication for farmers not to spray pesticides as spiders are potentially controlling the pest species. Interviews with farmers made clear that many farmers in the study area showed their interest in management methods that promote biological pest control.\\'Abstract: \\'The conservation of Himalayan forests is big concern in view of global agenda. Many studies in this endeavor reported that the rate of forests degradation is posing a severe threat to the landscape and existing biodiversity in the Himalayas. Currently there many conservation approaches exists and of them four are widely recognized (1) Conservation through traditional religious beliefs conserved (TCF); (2) Conservation through governmental planning and schemes conserved (GCF); (3) Conservation through creation of protected areas (PAF); and (4) Conservation through community efforts conserved (CCF). Our hypothesis in this direction says that all the conservation approaches lead to same results concerning to forest conservation. To testify our hypothesis we have studied the forests of each conservation regimes and evaluated them based on the identified indicators. We have done empirical studies and following the cloud-free satellite data were used for last three decades (such as Multi-Spectral Scanner, Linear Imaging and Self Scanning, and Enhanced Thematic Mapper ) to study a change in vegetation dynamics of the mountain forests in multi-temporal dimension. Our research concluded that community conservation approach have greater significance for biodiversity conservation and management in the Himalayan region. Here we support the model of CCF for forest ecosystem conservation, alongside the sustainable livelihood of the mountain societies. But every conservation regimes has its own importance in viewpoint of the particular objectives. Therefore, we suggests advancement and revision of PAF and GCF however, some elements of CCF can be introduced in TCF for making up it more sound in view of rapid socio-economic and cultural changes taking place in the communities.\\'Abstract: \\'The people of Manipur, a state in northeast India, follow ancestral worship and animism in the form of deity worship, with the central focus on worship in forest patches. The beliefs and taboos associated with the Sylvan deities (Umanglais) in the forest patches are restricted to any sort of disturbance of flora and fauna. These social boundaries help to conserve the entire organism as a whole, which stand the concept of sacred groves. The pleasing of deities is performed every year by the Meiteis, a dominant community of Manipur, in honour of the deities and to gain their favour. Indigenous cultural and rituals practices of the local people in sacred groves serve as a tool for conserving biodiversity. Sacred groves are distributed over a wide ecosystem and help in conservation of rare and endemic species. Well-preserved sacred groves are store houses of valuable medicinal and other plants having high economic value, and serve as a refuge to threatened species. One hundred and sixty-six sacred groves were inventoried in Manipur valley that comprises Imphal east, Imphal west, Thoubal and Bishnupur districts of the state. Detailed studies were carried out in four selected sacred groves, to know the importance of biodiversity status and vegetation characteristics. A total of 173 plant species representing 145 genera under 70 families were recorded through baseline floristic survey. The species diversity indices were compared among the four studied groves. The vegetation composition and community characteristics were recorded. Ethnobotanical uses of species were examined, which reveal that 96% of the species were used as medicine for the treatment of various ailments. Utilization of herbal medicine by the Meiteis is closely related to the cultural and ritual practices. A few of the medicinal plants which have disappeared from the locality are now confined only to the groves. Socio-cultural aspects were investigated taking into account the attitudes of local people, which indicate social beliefs and taboo are eroding, simultaneously degrading the degree of protection of sacred groves. Therefore, conservation measures of sacred groves need to be formulated considering the factor of degradation and the basic necessities of the local people. Until and unless a viable option is provided to the local people (especially those who habitat nearby the adjoining areas) for sustaining their economic condition, no step for conservation of biodiversity will be successful.\\'Abstract: \\'The taxonomy of the Hanuman langur (Semnopithecus spp.), a widely distributed Asian colobine monkey, has been in a flux for a long time due to much disagreement between various classification schemes. However, results from a recent field-based morphological study were consistent with (Ceylon J Sci 1939) species level classification scheme. Here we tested the validity of S. hypoleucos and S. priam, the two South Indian species recognized by Hill. To this end, one mitochondrial and four nuclear markers were sequenced from over 72 non-invasive samples of Hanuman langurs and S. johnii collected from across India. The molecular data were subjected to various tree building methods. The nuclear data was also used in a Bayesian structure analysis and to determine the genealogical sorting index of each hypothesized species. Results from nuclear data suggest that the South Indian population of Hanuman langur consists of two units that correspond to the species recognized by Hill. However in the mitochondrial tree S. johnii and S. priam were polyphyletic probably due to retention of ancestral polymorphism and/or low levels of hybridization. Implications of these results on conservation of Hanuman langurs are also discussed.\\'Abstract: \\'In the present communication habitat ecology, species diversity; distribution and different indices of fish biodiversity management were studied in a Central India river (River Betwa, a tributary of River Ganga basin approved under first river linking plan). Correlation between fish species richness with the hydrological attributes showed good relationship and water depth, dissolved oxygen and pH were found the most important variables in shaping fish assemblage. Altogether, sixty-three fish species belonging to 20 families and 45 genera were collected from five sampling stations spread along the upstream, mid stream and lower streams. Cyprinids were the most dominated group represented by 26 species belonging to 15 genera, followed by Bagridae (6 species from 3 genera), and Schilbeidae (4 species from 4 genera). The distribution of fish showed interesting pattern and about 10% species were common to all the sites showing long migration range. Shannon-Weiner diversity index showed considerable variation and ranged from 1.89 to 3.51. Out of 63 species status of 10 species were not known due to data deficit, 29 categorized as lower risk, 14 as vulnerable, 8 as endangered, while the remaining two species were introduced. Our study shows that the River supports considerable diversity of the fishes and is important for conservation and about 34% fish fauna is threatened being either vulnerable or endangered. We assessed that the river supports considerable percentage of food fish (89.47), ornamental fish (49.12%) and sport fish (5.26%). Among the eight major types of fish habitats identified along the entire stretch of river, open river, shallow water and deep pools were habitats contributing maximum diversity. Fish species richness (FSR) were significantly different in all the habitats except channel confluence and scour pool. Trophic niche model may be useful for assessing altered as well as less altered fish habitat of the tropical rivers. Since this river will be interlinked in near future, this study would be useful for conservation planning and management and also for future assessment after interlinking. Issues related to various threats to aquatic environment and conservation management strategies have been discussed.\\'Abstract: \\'Three explants namely, nodal, internodal and petiolar segments were used to establish in vitro cultures of Piper longum. Multiple shoots were induced on semi-solid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 6-benzyladenine (BA). Addition of ascorbic acid considerably reduced browning of tissue and medium. Best shoot regeneration was observed from petiolar explants and was, therefore, used for all further studies. An indexing method was introduced for checking bacterial contamination in well established shoot multiplication cultures. It was found that bacterial infection was quite high in shoots derived from nodal and internodal explants while it was least in those obtained from petiolar segments. Only shoots that indexed negative for endogenous bacteria were used for proliferation and in vitro conservation studies. At the end of in proliferation medium which consisted of MS supplemented with BA and ascorbic acid as many as 22 shoot buds of length could be obtained. Shoot buds developed into clusters for ease of further proliferation. A step of shoot elongation for in liquid MS basal medium was found to be beneficial for getting long and healthy shoots for rooting. Single shoots were rooted in indole butyric acid that could be successfully acclimatized under nethouse conditions. A conservation strategy was also developed. The shoot cultures could be maintained without subculturing for as long as in MS medium supplemented with paclobutrazol (PBZ) and ascorbic acid.\\'Abstract: \\'Cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum Maton) has great commercial value as a spice crop in India. A one-step protocol for direct regeneration of plants and in vitro conservation by slow growth method has been developed. A maximum of were obtained in or in on Murashige and Skoog (Physiol Plant 1962) medium benzylaminopurine gelled with 0.7% agar (micropropagation medium). Rooting also occurred simultaneously on the same medium. Using one shoot tip or nodal explant, about 30,375 plants can be regenerated in a year on the micropropagation medium. In vitro conservation by slow growth method was achieved on 1/2 MS (major agar (conservation medium); about 70% of the cultures survived up to at Successful regrowth of plants on micropropagation medium was obtained by culturing nodal explants excised from 18-mo-old conserved plants. Some 96% of the plants survived the hardening treatment and grew normally in a greenhouse. If 24 cultures are conserved on the conservation medium, it is possible to regenerate at least 750 plants by using explants derived from 70% of the surviving shoots and culturing the same in micropropagation medium for These plants may be used for planting or as a source of explants for the next conservation cycle. On the basis of 20 random amplified polymorphic DNA and 13 inter-simple sequence repeat primers analyses, no significant reproducible variation was detected among the in vitro-conserved plants compared with the mother plants.\\'Abstract: \\'In biodiversity-rich areas, both conservation and socioeconomic development are at the core of discussions among various stakeholders, such as local people, policymakers, conservationists, resource management professionals, economists, researchers/scientists, and so forth. Various innovations are being provided that aim at promoting both improved livelihood for the people and the conservation and management of natural resources in the Central Himalaya of India. Many studies point out the factors responsible for the tremendous decline of natural resources and also how they have affected the local livelihood options. In this context, the current study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of various solutions/innovations that are being implemented in the Himalayas of India. Unfortunately, only a few are found to be successful in both conservation and sustainable livelihood development. This study reveals that people are still looking for more viable solutions that could help them improve their lifestyle, as well as facilitating ecosystem conservation and supporting existing biodiversity. Based on the present study, it is argued that an in-depth empirical study of any region is a necessary process prior to offering solutions to achieve the desired goals, as considered by development agencies and policy-planners.\\'Abstract: \\'More than of bird species are threatened with extinction. Numerous anthropogenic activities and processes are considered responsible for such declines, including tourism related activities. These activities often occur in global biodiversity hotspots but consider the potential risks associated with tourism. The relative importance of tourism as a threat to birds was quantified using a global analysis of the threats facing critically endangered and endangered birds in the hotspots. Sixty-three critically endangered and endangered bird species are reportedly threatened by tourism. Among those 63 species, marine, coastal and aquatic birds are threatened more by tourism than was expected. Hotspots with the most species threatened by tourism are and the Mediterranean Basin. This study uses individual threatening processes in a new way to characterise hotspots for conservation action, advancing previous identification criteria. Analysing hotspots in terms of the relative presence of individual threatening processes may help to more effectively direct future research in these priority regions.\\'Jamaica\\'Abstract: \\'Forest fragmentation is one of the most important threats to global biodiversity, particularly in tropical developing countries. Identifying priority areas for conservation within these forests is essential to their effective management. However, this requires current, accurate environmental information that is often lacking in developing countries. The Cockpit Country, Jamaica, contains forests of international importance in terms of levels of endemism and overall diversity. information, we used satellite remote sensing data and fragmentation analysis to identify interior forested areas that have experienced little or no change as priority conservation sites. We classified Landsat images from 1985, 1989, 1995, 2002, and 2008, using an object-oriented method, which allowed for the inclusion of roads. We conducted our fragmentation analysis using metrics to quantify changes in forest patch number, area, shape, and aggregation. Deforestation and fragmentation fluctuated within the 23-year period but were mostly confined to the periphery of the forest, close to roads and access trails. An area of core forest that remained intact over the period of study was identified within the largest forest patch, most of which was located within the boundaries of a forest reserve and included the last remaining patches of closed-broadleaf forest. These areas should be given highest priority for conservation, as they constitute important refuges for endemic or threatened biodiversity. Minimizing and controlling access will be important in maintaining this core.\\'Abstract: \\'Plant invasion is highly responsive to rising temperature, altered precipitation and various anthropogenic disturbances. Therefore, climate anomalies might provide opportunities to identify the relationship of past climate in deriving the distribution of invasive species and to detect their probable future distribution. In this work, we studied the correlation of climate anomaly i.e. temperature and precipitation with an indicative map of plant invasive species grid) of India. The indicative map was generated through the plant data available from the project Characterization at Landscape Climate anomaly was calculated and represented by average temperature and precipitation using Research data for the period of 1901 to 2000. A comparison of local geographically weighted regression (GWR) model and a global ordinary least square regression (OLS) model was carried out for statistical analysis to depict the correlation at spatial grids. Overall, 20,501 records with a total of 9112 unique plots and 161 unique invasive species were recorded in the database that shows a maximum of 15 invasive species in a nested quadrat. Cumulative analysis showed a maximum of 53 invasive species at grid. Individually, GWR could reveal a significant correlation with invasive species distribution for temperature anomaly and precipitation anomaly while OLS model did not offer a good correlation compared to GWR. Combination of temperature and precipitation anomaly (shared model) showed an improved spatial correlation using GWR. Variation partitioning revealed the dominant influence of variation) of temperature anomaly over Deccan Peninsula, Himalaya and North East zone. Influence of precipitation anomaly was more prominent over arid and semi-arid zone explaining of variation. Results revealed the strength of GWR to see the interaction of invasive plant species w.r.t. climate anomalies that explain the influence of spatial variation due to heterogeneity at varying neighbour distances. The significant correlation of invasive species with both the anomalies revealed the affinity of invasive species towards warmer, drier and wet places. This gives an indication that the distribution of invasive species could be triggered by climate anomaly. The use of other predictor variables (i.e. edaphic and anthropogenic) could be an inclusive input in a future perspective.\\'Abstract: \\'Landscapes consist of heterogeneous interacting dynamic elements with complex ecological, economic and cultural attributes. These complex interactions help in the sustenance of natural resources through bio-geochemical and hydrological cycling. The ecosystem functions are altered with changes in the landscape structure. Fragmentation of large contiguous forests to small and isolated forest patches either by natural phenomena or anthropogenic activities leads to drastic changes in forest patch sizes, shape, connectivity and internal heterogeneity, which restrict the movement leading to inbreeding among Meta populations with extirpation of species.\\'Abstract: \\' Rhododendron nilagiricum Zenk is the only paleoendemic species of Rhododendron found at Nilgiris. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was carried out to study the extent of genetic polymorphism in trees collected from five locations at Nilgiris. Of the 15 primers tested, 10 revealed polymorphism. The percentage polymorphism ranged from 40 to 92 with an average of 61.5 polymorphism per primer. Pair wise comparisons were made for the RAPD profiles obtained through the use of 10 primers in the representative samples. Data analysis was done by using the POPGENE statistical package. The similarity matrix and the dendrogram obtained showed that there was close similarity between trees collected from different regions of Nilgiris. The cluster analysis showed positive correspondence between genetic diversity and geographic distance. Primer OPZ 13 generated the highest number of bands among the primers, revealed maximum polymorphism and had the greatest capacity for discriminating individuals of R. nilagiricum collected from different regions of Nilgiris.\\'Abstract: \\'The paper provides an overview of the developments in hydrobiological studies in India during the past fifty years, and links them with a historical perspective of the pre-independence studies. Hydrobiological studies which were well developed in the beginning of this century, gained momentum soon after independence as all kinds of aquatic habitats were investigated for the assessment, conservation and optimum utilization of inland fishery resources of the country. However, the environmental issues which dominated since the 1972 Stockholm Conference, and growing realization of the problem of water pollution, resulted in a rapid proliferation of hydrobiological studies which tend to focus on correlation between the distribution of various organisms and degree of water pollution or the effects of various organic and inorganic pollutants. A sampling of published literature reveals that long-term, analytical and experimental studies of the whole ecosystems (natural or experimental), and studies of population interactions, biomanipulation, food chain dynamics, and energy flows are wholly lacking. The paper calls for the strengthening of field and laboratory facilities, and establishment of regional and national institutes of aquatic ecology which will be necessary for the management of both the water quality and aquatic biological resources for sustainable development.\\'Abstract: \\'The south Asian summer monsoon from June to September accounts for the greater part of the annual rainfall over most of India and southeast Asia. The evolution of the summer and winter monsoon circulations over India is examined on the basis of the surface and upper air data of stations across India. The salient features of the seasonal reversals of temperature and pressure gradients and winds and the seasonal and synoptic fluctuations of atmospheric humidity are discussed. The space-time variations of rainfall are considered with the help of climatic pentad rainfall charts and diagrams. The rainfall of several north and central Indian stations shows a minimum around mid-August and a maximum around mid-February which seem to be connected with the extreme summer and winter positions of the ITCZ and the associated north-south shifts in the seasonal circulation patterns. Attention is drawn to the characteristic features of the monsoon rainfall that emerge from a study of daily and hourly rainfall of selected stations. Diurnal variations of temperature, pressure, wind and rainfall over the monsoon belt are briefly treated.\\'Abstract: \\'There is huge knowledge gap in our understanding of many terrestrial carbon cycle processes. In this paper, we investigate the bounds on terrestrial carbon uptake over India that arises solely due to CO  2  -fertilization. For this purpose, we use a terrestrial carbon cycle model and consider two extreme scenarios: unlimited CO2-fertilization is allowed for the terrestrial vegetation with CO2 concentration level at in one case, and CO2-fertilization is capped at year 1975 levels for another simulation. Our simulations show that, under equilibrium conditions, modeled carbon stocks in natural potential vegetation increase by 17 Gt-C with unlimited fertilization for CO2 levels and climate change corresponding to the end of 21st century but they decline by 5.5 Gt-C if fertilization is limited at 1975 levels of CO2 concentration. The carbon stock changes are dominated by forests. The area covered by natural potential forests increases by about 36% in the unlimited fertilization case but decreases by 15% in the fertilization-capped case. Thus, the assumption regarding CO2-fertilization has the potential to alter the sign of terrestrial carbon uptake over India. Our model simulations also imply that the maximum potential terrestrial sequestration over India, under equilibrium conditions and best case scenario of unlimited CO2-fertilization, is only 18% of the 21st century SRES A2 scenarios emissions from India. The limited uptake potential of the natural potential vegetation suggests that reduction of CO2 emissions and afforestation programs should be top priorities.\\'Abstract: \\'Biodiversity loss is a problem of global concern affecting ecosystem functioning and services provided to humans. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is built on a conceptual framework that links biodiversity with the services ecosystems provide to society and human welfare. Numerous empirical studies have measured ecosystem goods and services in terms of economic values; however, less evidence is available of the indirect effect of biodiversity on these values. Based on this, we first compile market and non-market forest valuation studies and, secondly, explore the potential of an econometric modelling exercise by conducting a worldwide meta-analysis. This exercise aims to highlight the role of biodiversity indicators on valuation. In this way, we can study the underlying transmission mechanisms that explain to what extent biodiversity is related to human welfare. Furthermore, we also propose to evaluate the magnitudes of the respective distributional impacts, including the different ecosystem goods and services under consideration. Our results show that biodiversity indicators may have an underlying effect on forest ecosystem values, which also depend on the type of ecosystem services. Lastly, the results are discussed and analysed with respect to their policy implications concerning biodiversity conservation.\\'based on RAPD and microsatellite markers\\'Abstract: \\'The two species of yellow catfish, Horabagrus brachysoma and H. nigricollaris are categorized as and respectively in their wild habitat. Proper knowledge of genetic structure and variability of these endangered species are highly essential for the management, conservation and improvement of fish stocks. Therefore, genetic variation and phylogenetic relationships between these species of yellow catfish sampled from Chalakkudy River in the hot spot of biodiversity-Western Ghats region, Kerala, India were analyzed by using Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and microsatellite markers. 85 RAPD and five microsatellites loci were detected to analyze the genetic variation and phylogenetic relationships among these species. Out of 85 RAPD loci produced only 52.94% were polymorphic whereas in microsatellite, all 5 loci were polymorphic (100%). Species-specific RAPD bands were found in both species studied. In microsatellite, the number of alleles across the five loci ranged from 1 to 8. The observed heterozygosities in H. brachysoma and H. nigricollaris were 0.463 and 0.443, respectively. Here, both RAPD and microsatellite methods reported a low degree of gene diversity and lack of genetic heterogeneity in both species of Horabagrus which strongly emphasize the need of fishery management, conservation and rehabilitation of these species.\\'Abstract: \\'The present study was undertaken in five major forest types (dominated by Quercus semecarpifolia, Quercus floribunda, Acer acuminatum, Abies pindrow and Aesculus indica, respectively) between 2400 and 2850 m a.s.l. in a moist temperate forest of the Mandal-Chopta area in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand, India. The aim was to assess the variation in composition and diversity in different vegetation layers, i.e., herb, shrub and tree, among these five forest types. Diversity indices, such as the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, density, total basal cover, concentration of dominance index, diversity index, equitability, species richness, species heterogeneity and were calculated to understand community structures. Dominance-diversity curves were drawn to ascertain resource apportionment among various species in different forest types.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Samples of the spotted murrel (Channa punctatus) were collected from three rivers of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The allozyme variation of C. punctatus was investigated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Eighteen enzymes were detected, but only 10 (EST, PGM, G3PDH, G6PDH, SOD, GPI, ODH, GDH, XDH, and CK) showed consistent phenotypic variations. Allele frequencies were estimated at the 18 polymorphic loci representing 10 enzymes. Two rare alleles, EST-4*C and G6PDH-2*C, were noted in the Tamirabarani and Kallada populations but were absent in the Siruvani population. The allele frequencies of the Tamirabarani and Kallada populations were similar, except for a few loci. Among the three populations, the maximum genetic distance (0.026) and FST (0.203) were found between the geographically distant Siruvani and Kallada populations. Overall the study showed that among the three populations, the Tamirabarani and Kallada have similar genetic structures.\\'Abstract: \\'There is a constant need for novel antibiotic and antioxidant sources due to the ever-increasing resilience of pathogens and the occurrence of chronic diseases. The natural sources of these agents have advantages due to lower production cost, structural variation, and uses of active compounds for pharmaceutical uses. The microbes living in planta termed are alternative sources of host bioactive compounds. In this study, ten endophytic fungi were isolated from Polygonum chinense L. and identified by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer regions. The fungal strains were fermented and the ethyl acetate extracts were evaluated for antimicrobial and antioxidant capacities. Almost 80% of the endophytes showed antibacterial potency against one or more pathogenic bacteria. Among all strains, Penicillium canescens showed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens as well as significant antioxidative and DNA protective capacities. The strain Fusarium chlamydosporum displayed significant anti-radical and ferric reducing dry extract) capacities. The bio-autography, chromatography, and mass spectroscopy analyses of P. canescens extract revealed the presence of sesquiterpene (germacrene), plasticizer (phthalic acid ester) along with phenolic acids, flavonoid (quercetin), and short chain hydrocarbons. The secondary metabolites of F. chlamydosporum were identified with phenolic acids as bioactive compounds by chromatography and mass spectroscopy. This study indicates P. chinense endophytes as potential sources of antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds for novel drug discovery.\\'Abstract: \\'Large connected landscapes are paramount to maintain top predator populations. Across their range, tiger (Panthera tigris) populations occur in small fragmented patches of habitat, often isolated by large distances in human-dominated landscapes. We assessed connectivity between 16 protected areas (PAs) in central India, a global priority landscape for tiger conservation, using data on land use and land cover, human population density, and transportation infrastructure. We identified and prioritized movement routes using a combination of least-cost corridor modeling and circuit theory. Our analyses suggest that there are several opportunities to maintain connectivity in this landscape. We mapped a total of thirty-five linkages in the region and calculated metrics to estimate their quality and importance. The highest quality linkages as measured by the ratio of cost-weighted distance to Euclidean distance are and cost-weighted distance to least-cost path length are We used current flow centrality to evaluate the contribution of each PA and linkage toward facilitating animal movement. Values are highest for Kanha and Pench tiger reserves, and the linkages between and suggesting that these PAs and linkages play a critical role in maintaining connectivity in central India. In addition, smaller areas such as Bor, Nawegaon, and Phen have high centrality scores relative to their areas and thus may act as important stepping stones. We mapped pinch points, which are sections of the linkages where tiger movement is restricted due to unfavorable habitat, transportation networks, human habitation, or a combination of factors. Currently, very limited data exist on tiger movement outside of PAs to validate model results. Regional-scale connectivity mapping efforts can assist managers and policy makers to develop strategic plans for balancing wildlife conservation and other land uses in the landscape.\\'Abstract: \\'The goal of biodiversity hotspots is to identify regions around the world where conservation priorities should be focused. We undertake a geographic information system and remote sensing analysis to identify the rarest and least protected forests in biodiversity hotspots. World Wildlife Fund ecoregions with terrestrial forest were subset from 34 biodiversity hotspots and forest cover calculated from GlobCover data at a pixel resolution. There were 276 ecoregions in 32 biodiversity hotspots classified as containing terrestrial forests. When the first quartile of forest ecoregions was subset based on smallest extent of forest cover in protected areas, there were 69 rare forests identified within 20 biodiversity hotspots. Most rare forest ecoregions (45) occurred on islands or island archipelagos and 47 rare forest ecoregions contained less than forest cover in protected areas. San Ambrosio Islands Temperate Forests, Tubuai Tropical Moist Forests, Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago Tropical Moist Forests, and Yap Tropical Dry Forests were identified as the least protected and possibly most vulnerable forests within biodiversity hotspots. These ecoregions cover less than forest cover is less than and there are no protected areas. There is a need to update classifications and boundaries of protected areas, insure that islands are included in global land cover datasets, and identify levels of endemism and endangerment within forest ecoregions. This should improve our ability to compare, prioritize, and monitor forests in biodiversity hotspots.\\'Abstract: \\'Camptothecin (CPT), a monoterpene indole alkaloid, is a potent inhibitor of eukaryotic topoisomerase I (Top 1). Because of this property, several derivatives of CPT are widely used as chemotherapeutic agents. The compound is produced by several plant species, including Nothapodytes nimmoniana (Family: Icacinaceae) presumably as a deterrent to insect pests. Here, we report, a lepidopteran larva, Lymantria sp. of Lymantriidae family which feeds voraciously on the leaves of N. nimmoniana, without any adverse consequences. Larval body weight and molting period were unaffected despite captive feeding of the larva with CPT enriched leaves. Mass spectrometric analysis indicated that nearly 46% of the ingested CPT was excreted while the rest was sequestered predominantly in the exuviae and setae (~35%). Although most of the CPT was in the parental form as found in the plant, traces of inactive, sulfated forms of CPT were recovered from the larva. Compared to that in plant, there were no critical mutations at the CPT binding domain of the Top 1. The gut pH of the larva was alkaline The alkaline gut environment converts CPT from its active, lactone form to inactive, carboxylate form. It is likely that such conversion might help the larva to reduce the overall burden of CPT in its gut. We discuss the results in the context of the mechanisms of resistance adapted by insects to plant toxins.\\'Abstract: \\'Node explants collected from flowering plants of Vanda spathulata, an endemic and exquisite orchid of Peninsular India and Sri Lanka, were cultured in Mitra medium with combinations of 6-benzyl adenine (BA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA).

However, small carnivores figure very poorly in research and conservation policies in India. This is mainly due to the dearth of tested and standardized techniques that are both cost effective and conducive to small carnivore studies in the field.

These data are used in combination with monthly average surface meteorological observations in a surface energy balance model to estimate monthly mean actual evapotranspiration (AET) from different climatic zones of Maharasthra,. India. AET is estimated between April and December months for two contrasting monsoons in 1992 and 1995. Estimates reasonably agree with pan evaporation data during growing season and with AET estimated from water balance procedure. AET is low in semi-arid dry land areas of central Maharashtra and significantly high in the humid-perhumid western ghat region and subhumid eastern Maharashtra region. The modeled evapotranspiration show the influence of seasonal vegetation in different climatic zones from the region. The method can be used to obtain large-scale evapotranspiration with minimum ground observations.\\'sensing datasets\\'Abstract: \\'Leaf phenology describes the seasonal cycle of leaf functioning and is essential for understanding the interactions between the biosphere, the climate and the atmosphere. In this study, we characterized the spatial patterns in phenological variations in eight contrasting forest types in an Indian region using coarse resolution NOAA AVHRR satellite data. The onset, offset and growing season length for different forest types has been estimated using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Further, the relationship between NDVI and climatic parameters has been assessed to determine which climatic variable (temperature or precipitation) best explain variation in NDVI. In addition, we also assessed how quickly and over what time periods does NDVI respond to different precipitation events. Our results suggested strong spatial variability in NDVI metrics for different forest types. Among the eight forest types, tropical dry deciduous forests showed lowest values for summed NDVI (SNDVI), averaged NDVI (ANDVI) and integrated NDVI (I-NDVI), while the tropical wet evergreen forests of Arunachal Pradesh had highest values. Within the different evergreen forest types, SNDVI, ANDVI and INDVI were highest for tropical wet evergreen forests, followed by tropical evergreen forests, tropical semi-evergreen forests and were least for tropical dry evergreen forests. Differences in the amplitude of NDVI were quite distinct for evergreen forests compared to deciduous ones and mixed deciduous forests. Although, all the evergreen forests studied had a similar growing season length of 270 days, the onset and offset dates were quite different. Response of vegetative greenness to climatic variability appeared to vary with vegetation characteristics and forest types. Linear correlations between mean monthly NDVI and temperature were found to yield negative relationships in contrast to precipitation, which showed a significant positive response to vegetation greenness. The correlations improved much for different forest types when the log of cumulative rainfall was correlated against mean monthly NDVI. Of the eight forest types, the NDVI for six forest types was positively correlated with the logarithm of cumulative rainfall that was summed for months. Overall, this study identifies precipitation as a major control for vegetation greenness in tropical forests, more so than temperature.\\'Abstract: \\'Demand for new environmental services from forests requires improved monitoring of these services at three scales: project-, regional-, and national-level. Most forest management activities are organized at the project scale, while the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) recognizes the nation as the party to the agreement. Hence, measurement and monitoring issues are emerging at the intersections of the project and national scales, referred to here as monitoring-domain edge effects. The following actions are necessary to improve existing monitoring capabilities and to help resolve project/national edge effects: (1) consensus on standard methods and protocols for monitoring mitigation activities, their off-site greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts, the fate of forest products and their relation to national GHG inventories (baselines); (2) a global program for collecting land use, land cover, biomass burning, and other data essential for national baselines; (3) the development of new nested-monitoring-domain methods that allow projects to be identified in national GHG inventories (baselines), and permit tracking of leakage of GHGs and wood product flows outside project boundary and over time; and (4) presentation of a set of credible, carefully designed, and well-documented forest mitigation activities that resolve most of the current issues.\\'Abstract: \\'Ocbil theory aims to develop hypotheses explaining the evolution and ecology of, and best conservation practices for, biota on very old, climatically buffered, infertile landscapes (Ocbils).\\'Abstract: \\'A set of 24 strains belonging to the genus Anabaena (Phylum Cyanobacteria), isolated from diverse geographic locations in India, were evaluated along with three International type strains of Anabaena (ATCC 29414, ATCC 29208 and ATCC 27899) for their morphological, physiological and biochemical diversity. The morphological dataset, consisting of 58 variants for 15 characters, and SDS-PAGE protein profiles comprising 17 polymorphic bands were utilized to differentiate the selected Anabaena strains and explore the patterns of diversity through cluster analysis. Physiological and biochemical characterization with respect to nitrogen fixation and accumulation of chlorophyll and phycobiliproteins led to the identification of some highly promising Anabaena strains for use as biofertilizers and source of pigments. The study highlighted the tremendous inter and intraspecific diversity within the Anabaena isolates and indicated the potential as well as constraints of the morphological and protein profiling datasets for unambiguous differentiation and analyses of diversity among the Anabaena strains.\\'Abstract: \\'This study reports a protocol for successful micropropagation of Decalepis arayalpathra (Joseph and Chandras) Venter. (Janakia arayalpathra Joseph and Chandrasekhran; Periplocaceae), a critically endangered and endemic ethnomedicinal plant in the southern forests of the Western Ghats which is overexploited for its tuberous medicinal roots by the local Kani tribes. Natural regeneration is rare and conventional propagation is difficult. Conservation of the species through micropropagation was attempted. The nodal explants of greenhouse-raised plants, were more desirable than cotyledonary nodal explants of aseptic seedlings. The basal nodes (73%) of greenhouse-grown plants cultured in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 12.96 6-benzyladenine (BA), 2.48 2-isopentenyladenine (2-ip) and 2.68 acid (NAA) formed cm long unbranched robust solitary shoots in 8 wk. Cotyledonary nodal explants cultured in the same medium showed multiple shoot formation and axillary branching. But the shoots were thin, fragile and not suitable for mass propagation. Single nodes of a solitary shoot subcultured on MS medium containing 2.22 BA and 0.24 2-ip together produced nodes from cm long shoots within wk. The basal nodes of the shoots so formed were repeatedly subcultured to increase the stock of propagules while the cm terminal cuttings were used for rooting. The best root induction (68%) and survival (86%) was achieved on half-strength MS medium supplemented with 1.07 NAA. Field-established plants showed uniform growth and phenotypic similarity to parental stock.\\'regenerated plants of Decalepis salicifolia (Bedd. ex Hook.f.)

As much as 90% plantlets survived when was used as planting substrate and finally established in soil without any casualty and morphological variation. Acclimatized plantlets were screened for pigment content, net photosynthetic rate (PN), stomatal conductance (Gs) and transpiration rate (E) during subsequent days of acclimatization as well as the changes in antioxidant was also evaluated. A steady rise was observed in the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) for initial and then after a decrease was found showing improved acclimatization efficiency of the plant. Similarly, the activities of catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) enzyme shows reliable increase as the days of acclimatization advanced which play their precautionary role against oxidative damage to the plant. The genetic fidelity of the in vitro raised plantlets with that of mother plant was further confirmed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inters simple sequence repeats (ISSR) analysis. Additionally, the effect of acclimatization on the biosynthesis of 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (2H4MB) in the root system was also evaluated in relation to their biomass production. Maximum fresh weight dry weight of roots and 2H4MB content of root extract) was obtained after of acclimatization. Accelerated multiplication rate with the stability of genetic virtue, physiological and biochemical parameter assure the efficacy of the protocol developed for the propagation of this critically endangered medicinal plant.\\'Abstract: \\' Knema andamanica is a red-listed endemic medicinal species of Myristicaceae restricted to Andaman and Nicobar (A&N) Islands, India. This species is used in tribal medicines and has immense bioprospective potential. With a view to generate suitable genomic markers for classification and identification, we have generated RAPD, SCAR and conserved 18S rDNA markers from K. andamanica. A unique fragment, that distinguished it from seven other related species of Myristicaceae was first amplified using the random primer OPE 06 and converted to SCAR marker (GenBank accession # JN228256). The conserved sequences of 18S rDNA loci from K. andamanica were also amplified and sequenced (GenBank accession #JN228265). The sequence revealed deviations including 18 variable regions and 15 indels that were unique to K. andamanica. These markers can help in definite identification of K. andamanica even at the juvenile stages.\\'Abstract: \\'Recent research point to the Indian wild taxa of Cucumis callosus (Rottler) Cogn. as the wild progenitor of melon (C. melo L.). Overlapping distribution with cultivated and weedy and feral forms of melo and normal fertility of F1 and BC1 generations of its cross with cultivated melon indicate its progenitor status. A perusal of herbarium data indicate its natural distribution pattern in the region comprising Vindhya Hills and Aravalli mountain ranges extending northwards to Indo-Gangetic plains and southwards to the Deccan plateau touching rain shadow areas of Western Ghats. Characterised by drought tolerance and field resistance to a host of pests and diseases, it is conspicuously absent in the high rainfall areas of Western Ghats and upper Himalayan region. Based on its morphological distinction and F1 and BC1 fertility with C. melo, a subspecific rank within C. melo is postulated. First-hand information on its occurrence, distribution and crossability relationship with other Indian taxa of Cucumis are given.\\'Abstract: \\'A synoptic revision of the genus Smythea Seem.

Market creation establishes a market in the external benefit or cost in question (e.g. biodiversity or pollution reduction) and leaves the relevant parties to adjust their behaviour accordingly. While most attention has been paid to market creation through tradable permits and taxes (the it is less easy to secure a perspective on initiatives. Both polluter-pays and beneficiary-pays initiatives are examples of modified Coaseian bargains in which governments intervene in the bargains to lower transactions costs, establish property rights, deal with public goods issues, or act on behalf of disadvantaged groups. This paper reviews four major initiatives in this respect - debt-for-nature swaps, bioprospecting and the Global Environment Facility at the global level, and the Costa Rican Forest Law at the local level. It finds that while there is much to applaud in initiatives in these new markets, serious questions remain about the modest flows of funds associated with such and the extent to which they secure environmental improvements relative to the baseline of business-as-usual.\\'Abstract: \\'Identifying the factors that contribute to species distribution will help determine the impact of the changing climate on range contraction and expansion. Ecological niche modelling is used to analyze the present and potential future distribution of rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) in two biogeographically distinct regions of India i.e., the Western Ghats (WG) and Northeast (NE). The rubber tree is an economically important plantation species, and therefore factors other than climate may play a significant role in determining its occurrence. To assist in future planning, we used the maximum entropy model to predict plausible areas for the expansion of rubber tree plantations under a changing climate scenario. Inclusion of elevation, soil and socioeconomic factors into the model did not result in a significant increase in the model accuracy estimates over the bioclimatic model but their effect was pronounced in the predicted probability scoring of species occurrence. Among various factors, elevation, rooting condition, village population and agricultural labour availability contributed substantially to the model in the NE region, whereas for the WG region, climate was the most important contributing factor for rubber tree distribution. We found that more areas would be suitable for rubber tree plantation in the NE region, whereas further expansion would be limited in the WG region under the projected climate scenario for 2050.\\'Abstract: \\'We present here the first use of DNA barcoding in a new approach to ethnobotany we coined \"ethnobotany genomics\". This new approach is founded on the concept of of biodiversity knowledge, which includes a coming together of different ways of knowing and valorizing species variation in a novel approach seeking to add value to both traditional knowledge (TK) and scientific knowledge (SK). We employed contemporary genomic technology, DNA barcoding, as an important tool for identifying cryptic species, which were already recognized ethnotaxa using the TK classification systems of local cultures in the Velliangiri Hills of India. This research is based on several case studies in our lab, which define an approach to that is poised to evolve quickly with the advent of new ideas and technology. Our results show that DNA barcoding validated several new cryptic plant species to science that were previously recognized by TK classifications of the Irulas and Malasars, and were lumped using SK classification. The contribution of the local aboriginal knowledge concerning plant diversity and utility in India is considerable; our study presents new ethnomedicine to science. Ethnobotany genomics can also be used to determine the distribution of rare species and their ecological requirements, including traditional ecological knowledge so that conservation strategies can be implemented. This is aligned with the Convention on Biological Diversity that was signed by over 150 nations, and thus the complex array of human-natural-technological relationships has effectively been re-organized.\\'Abstract: \\'1. Schubert V, Berr A, Meister A (2012) Interphase chromatin organisation inArabidopsisnuclei: constraints versus randomnessChromosoma121Abstract: \\'The Nilwala Ganga Basin of Sri Lanka includes important natural wetlands that are habitat for vulnerable animal and plant species. Flood protection and intensive rice production in the Basin have resulted in degraded acid soils and declining rice yields. However, traditional rice production outside the flood protection scheme has continued to generate a high-value rice product. This study reports on interviews conducted with farmers and other stakeholders to document the production practices and the potential environmental and economic benefits associated with maavee rice paddies. The maavee production system has prevailed for at least several decades. Farmers apply no chemicals to their paddies, relying instead on alluvial deposits as a source of nutrients, and on the natural pest and disease resistance of their traditional varieties. The maavee rice product can attain three times the selling price of rice from conventional farms making it more economically viable than conventional rice production. However, much of maavee production is for home consumption and the system is threatened by increasing labour costs, an ageing farming population and pressures to increase rice yields. Non-invasive production practices and the proximity of maavee paddies to regenerating wetlands in the Kirala Kele Sanctuary suggest that traditional paddies may constitute an important habitat for vulnerable wildlife; however, maavee farmers also perceive wetland birds as potentially damaging to rice. Based on a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis, we make recommendations for future research needs and potential management actions to safeguard the environmental and economic sustainability of the maavee system.\\'Abstract: \\'Analyzing the spatial extent and distribution of forest fires is essential for sustainable forest resource management.

Genetic resources of rice were collected for about and 1069 germplasm accessions including 154 named landraces were collected. Prominent landraces such as Begumi, Ramjwain, Thapachini, Naurang, Hansraj, Tilakchandan, Lalsati, Jhini, Mushakbudji, Jattoo, Barpasso, Qadirbeigh, Safedbrez, Shahie known for their special quality attributes were collected. The change in land use, cropping patterns and aggressive introduction of modern varieties in the region has resulted in the loss of a large number of landraces especially from irrigated lands. The present paper looks at the status of rice genetic resources, genetic variability, genetic erosion and future strategies to conserve rice germplasm on farm and to maximize its use in rice breeding.\\'Abstract: \\'A new lumped conceptual model based on the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) concept has been proposed in this paper for long-term hydrologic simulation and it has been tested using the data of five catchments from different climatic and geographic settings of India. When compared with the Mishra et al. (2005) model based on variable source area (VSA) concept, the proposed model performed better in all applications. Both the models however exhibited a better match between the simulated and observed runoff in high runoff producing watersheds than did in low runoff producing catchments. Using the results of the proposed model, dominant/dormant processes involved in runoff generating mechanism have also been identified. The presented model is found useful in the continuous simulation of process in watersheds.\\'Abstract: \\'1.

Each bud cultured in turn for 4 weeks on WPM with 1.0 BAP formed secondary buds which were repeatedly recultured to increase bud production. Altogether this method enabled an estimated harvest of 7848 buds from a single shoot tip in 28 months. Shoots cm) developed from bud cultures were rooted in half-strength WPM medium with 0.5 each of NAA and IBA, and of the rooted plants were established in the field after hardening.

However, a detailed study of the type materials, recently collected specimens, as well as SEM analysis of pollen and mericarp of both species suggests that P. bishopianus is a distinct species. The specific status of P. bishopianus is thus reinstated, and it can be easily distinguished from P. deccanicus by the stem nature, leaf size and shape, cyme length, number of flowers per cyme, the structure of flowering and fruiting calyx and mericarp surface. Additionally, complete taxonomic descriptions, photographs and conservation assessments, along with notes on distribution and habitat of both species, are provided.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Reproductive output and fertility variation in teak were evaluated in five study sites in Western Ghats region of southern India. In four seed production areas (SPA1-4)) and a natural population (NAT) plots with 100 trees were investigated. The 40-year-old seed production areas are located in high rainfall sites in Kerala state and the natural stand is at a drier location in Tamil Nadu. Fruit production per tree was rather high in the natural stand (1500) and quite variable in the seed production areas. SPA 4, located far south from the other sites, had the highest fruit production (almost twice that in the other study sites), high relative population size (N  r and predicted low genetic drift in two consecutive years. Fecundity was very low in SPAs 2 & 3 (200 fruits per tree). Reproductive output was similar in successive years except SPA 1, where the fruit production in the first year was almost five times that in the second year. Fertility variation (computed as sibling coefficient, was in general higher in NAT and hence the relative population size was lower than in SPAs. The variation in female fertility in the natural stand was, somewhat surprisingly, similar to that in the seed production areas, while the male fertility variation was higher. In the seed production areas the male fertility variation was lower or similar to the female fertility variation. The fertility variation, was on average around 3 and correspondingly the relative effective population size, N  r and the variance effective number around 60. Selection for tree diameter would improve predicted diversity of the seed crop as it was positively correlated with reproductive output and negatively correlated with fertility variation among trees.\\'Abstract: \\'The Hanuman langur is one of the most widely distributed and morphologically variable non-human primates in South Asia. Even though it has been extensively studied, the taxonomic status of this species remains unresolved due to incongruence between various classification schemes. This incongruence, we believe, is largely due to the use of plastic morphological characters such as coat color in classification. Additionally these classification schemes were largely based on reanalysis of the same set of museum specimens. To bring greater resolution in Hanuman langur taxonomy we undertook a field survey to study variation in external morphological characters among Hanuman langurs. The primary objective of this study is to ascertain the number of morphologically recognizable units (morphotypes) of Hanuman langur in peninsular India and to compare our field observations with published classification schemes. We typed five color-independent characters for multiple adults from various populations in South India. We used the presence-absence matrix of these characters to derive the pair-wise distance between individuals and used this to construct a neighbor-joining (NJ) tree. The resulting NJ tree retrieved six distinct clusters, which we assigned to different morphotypes. These morphotypes can be identified in the field by using a combination of five diagnostic characters. We determined the approximate distributions of these morphotypes by plotting the sampling locations of each morphotype on a map using GIS software. Our field observations are largely concordant with some of the earliest classification schemes, but are incongruent with recent classification schemes. Based on these results we recommend Hill (Ceylon Journal of Science, Colombo 21:277-305, 1939) and Pocock (Primates and carnivora (in part) (pp. London: Taylor and Francis, 1939) classification schemes for future studies on Hanuman langurs.\\'Abstract: \\'In this study we analyzed climate and crop yields data from Indian cardamom hills for the period to investigate whether there were significant changes in weather elements, and if such changes have had significant impact on the production of spices and plantation crops. Spatial and temporal variations in air temperatures (maximum and minimum), rainfall and relative humidity are evident across stations. The mean air temperature increased significantly during the last the greatest increase and the largest significant upward trend was observed in the daily temperature. The highest increase in minimum temperature was registered for June at the Myladumpara station. December and January showed greater warming across the stations. Rainfall during the main monsoon months showed a downward trend. Relative humidity showed increasing and decreasing trends, respectively, at the cardamom and tea growing tracts. The warming trend coupled with frequent wet and dry spells during the summer is likely to have a favorable effect on insect pests and disease causing organisms thereby pesticide consumption can go up both during excess rainfall and drought years. The incidence of many minor pest insects and disease pathogens has increased in the recent years of our study along with warming. Significant and slight increases in the yield of small cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum M.) and coffee (Coffea arabica), respectively, were noticed in the recent years.; however the improvement of yield in tea (Thea sinensis) and black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) has not been seen in our analysis.\\'Abstract: \\' Oryza malampuzhaensis, one of the tetraploid taxa of the genusOryza, is geographically restricted to Western Ghats of South India. Its taxonomic status is not well established and is generally treated as a tetraploid race of O. officinalis. Sixty-three morphological traits and 262 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers generated by 23 random decamer primers were used to assess the genetic relationship between O. malampuzhaensis and O. officinalis. Pair wise comparisons based on both RAPDs and morphological traits revealed 60% genetic distance between the two taxa and was significantly higher (p <0.01) than the corresponding intra-specific distances. Cluster and principal component analysis (PCA) of genetic distance estimations based on RAPDs and morphological traits clearly differentiated the two taxa. High frequency of discrete O. malampuzhaensis specific RAPDs (21%) and the significantly higher (p < 0.05) mean number of amplification products per individual in O. malampuzhaensis observed in the study reflect its allopolyploid nature. Low genetic diversity within O. malampuzhaensis revealed by RAPD analysis indicates the recent origin of this taxa. The RAPD analysis further revealed the possibility that the putative genomeprogenitor of O. malampuzhaensis is a close relative of O. officinalis. In addition, amplification products diagnostic to O. malampuzhaensis were identified. The results of the present study clearly demonstrated that the O. malampuzhaensis is a distinct entity, and support the recent conclusion that O. malampuzhaensis has diverged enough to deserve species status.\\'Abstract: \\'The spatial changes in forest cover of Similipal biosphere reserve, Odisha, India over eight decades has been quantified by using multi-temporal data from different sources. Over the period, the forest cover reduced by 970.8 km2 (23.6% of the total forest), and most significantly during the period, Human-induced activities like conversion of forest land for agriculture, construction of dams and mining activities have been identified as major drivers of deforestation. Spatial analysis indicates that 399 grids (1 grid = 1 1 km) have undergone large-scale changes in forest cover (>75 ha) during while only 3 grids have shown >75 ha loss during Annual net rate of deforestation was 0.58 during which has been reduced substantially during (0.04). Annual gross rate of deforestation in is indeed low (0.01) as compared to the national and global average. This study highlights the impact and effectiveness of conservation practices in minimizing the rate of deforestation and protecting the Similipal Biosphere Reserve.\\'Abstract: \\'In the coastal littoral forest of extreme southeastern Madagascar, westudied tree diameter at breast height (DBH) 10 cm in 20, 50 m plots in each of four forest fragments, andunderstorywoody vegetation (DBH < 10 cm, m tall) in60,10 10 m plots in three of the fragments.

For each tree, DBH was recorded. Mean tree diameter andpatterns of tree size class distribution did not differ among the four forestfragments. However, the fragments differed significantly in both tree andunderstory stem densities, species richness and diversity values, and familyrichness values, with the Lokaro fragment having the lowest values for allmeasures. Furthermore, floristic patterns, family importance values, and communitysimilarity measures revealed that the species composition at theLokaro fragment was very different from the Sainte-Luce fragments.

In okra, the predominant biotic stresses are yellow vein mosaic disease (YVMD), shoot and fruit borer and leaf hopper. Sixty eight (68) accessions belonging to four wild Abelmoschus species [Abelmoschus caillei (A. Chev.) Stevels, Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medik., Abelmoschus moschatus (L.) Medik. and Abelmoschus tuberculatus Pal et Singh] and eight okra varieties were characterized and evaluated for phenological characters including biotic stresses under natural epiphytotic condition. The wild species examined consisted of 18 accessions (16 exotic and 2 indigenous) of A. caillei, 29 accessions of A. manihot, 16 accessions of A. moschatus and 5 accessions of A. tuberculatus. All the wild Abelmoschus species exhibited high diversity (as measured by Shannon Diversity Index) for 3 qualitative characters viz. intensity of stem colour, leaf shape, epicalyx shape, 13 quantitative characters and 3 biotic stress parameters. Among the wild species, A. caillei and A. tuberculatus showed maximum and minimum diversity for qualitative characters, respectively. There was significant variation for 19 out of 24 quantitative characters studied. Inter-species diversity pattern as estimated through Minimum Variance Dendrogram and Principal Component Analysis revealed clear differentiation among the species with minimum overlapping indicating close association between geographical origins and clustering pattern. Intra-species diversity indicated role of specific adaptation in sub-clustering. Resistance to YVMD was found in accessions belonging to three wild species viz. A. caillei, A. manihot and A. moschatus while resistance to shoot and fruit borer and leaf hopper was found in accessions of all the four wild species. The resistant accessions can further be used for introgressing biotic stress resistance through pre-breeding into cultivated okra species.\\'Abstract: \\'1.

Variations at 14 loci from 14 enzyme systems were analyzed. The allozyme analysis revealed a high level of genetic variation in this species, with an average of observed alleles per locus of 2.357 and observed heterozygosity of 0.178. The positive value of the fixation index (F implied a significant deficiency of heterozygosity at the population level. The highly significant probability for the overall loci suggested that the three sample sets were not part of the same gene pool. \\'Abstract: \\'The present study investigates the hydrological response of increase in urbanization on water stressed Upper Bhima River basin which lies in a semi-arid climatic zone of Maharashtra state, India. Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes due to urbanization, industrialization and anthropogenic activities have reconfigured the waterscape of the river basin, which has affected its regional hydrology. Influence of urbanization on key hydrological components is studied using Soil and Water Assessment Tool model. Firstly, Object Based Image Analysis approach was used to prepare time series LULC maps of the years 1992, 2002, 2009 and 2014. Overall classification accuracy of 92.48% and Kappa Coefficient (K) of 0.87 were achieved. Urbanization indicators, e.g. population urbanization level (Up) and spatial urbanization level (Us), were used to quantify the growth patterns in population and urban areas respectively. trend test was performed on the average annual rainfall data (year to study rainfall trends across the region. Further, combination of statistical analyses including correlation analysis and multivariate analysis of variance were performed to comprehend the causative connection and interrelationships between Us and hydrological parameters. The results reveal that during with increase in Us of 0.05, the average annual surface runoff increased to [standard deviation sum of squares whereas percolation decreased to and base flow decreased to These hydrological parameters are highly influenced by increase in urbanization. This study is relevant for various stakeholders such as water sources planners and policy makers for assessment of water resources to ensure sustainable development in the urbanizing tropical river basins. Remedial measures are suggested to minimize the adverse effect of urbanization on hydrological processes.\\'agroforestry system\\'Abstract: \\'The present study is focussed on development of a high-frequency micro-multiplication system in Calamus thwaitesii, through somatic embryogenesis from immature zygotic embryos cultured in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The semi-friable calli when cultured in the same medium augmented with 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and acetic acid (NAA) discrete globular embryoids in The isolated embryoids in hormone-free media yielded 65% plantlets. Furthermore, embryoids and axenic shoots exhibited maximum shoot induction in medium supplemented with Thidiazuron (TDZ). The shoot initials after subculture in media supplemented with BAP and TDZ produced shoot proliferation followed by elongation in basal medium. The elongated shoots produced roots in media supplemented with NAA. With this established rooted plantlets could be harvested after from a single embryoid. Genetic stability analysis of the plantlets using inter simple sequence repeat markers recorded only 0.05% genetic polymorphism. The plantlets were hardened in a mist house for and then to 50% shade house for another and the well-established 6-month-old nursery plants, reintroduced to selected forest segments, exhibited 86% field establishment even after of observation. Thus, the mass multiplication system developed could be a breakthrough for large-scale multiplication of C. thwaitesii to ensure continuous supply of quality planting material to the cottage industry through the development of agroforestry systems. Furthermore, the in vitro culture system developed here can be replicated for research activities related to the conservation, micro-multiplication and sustainable utilization of rare, endangered, endemic, monopodial/single stemmed rattan palms.\\'Abstract: \\'V.

M.M.Le Roux & B.-E.van Wyk. Crotalaria subsection Bracteatae is re-evaluated to ascertain its position in the Calycinae clade. Evidences from morphological and molecular sequence data (ITS and trnL-F regions) are used to assess the subsectional position of Bracteatae. Within the recognized 12 species in the subsection, the morphological characters currently used to distinguish these species, are insignificant and overlapping and do not merit diagnostic characters of the species. Examination of the types and vouchers at different herbaria and specimens collected during field trips enabled us for a new interpretation of the existing circumscription of the species. Further, pod anatomical and molecular sequence data were also used for the delimitation of the species. Based on the results of the above studies, a new circumscription has been formalized here and contains five recognized species in the Bracteatae clade, viz., C. berteroana DC., C. longipes Wight & Arn., C. paniculata Willd., C. pulchra DC. and C. pellita DC. of the section Calycinae emend.

Apomictic seeds of G. indica were found to be morphogenetically most potential followed by G. cambogia. The explants of G. xanthochymus were highly recalcitrant towards in vitro conditions and failed to induce adventitious buds on any of the media tested. High frequency direct shoot bud differentiation was induced in aseptic seed cultures of G. indica and G. cambogia on MS medium supplemented with cytokinins (BAP, kinetin or TDZ). Amongst the three cytokinins tested, TDZ was most effective for adventitious bud differentiation in both G. indica and G. cambogia, however, the proliferating buds failed to elongate. Substantial number of buds induced on BAP supplemented media elongated into shoots after subculture on elongation medium. Addition of NAA along with cytokinins in the induction medium enhanced callusing without improvement in bud induction response. The induced adventitious buds were elongated on MS basal medium containing 0.2% activated charcoal. Direct rooting was achieved in both G. indica and G. cambogia on auxin supplemented media with best response at IBA concentration in both the species. The in vitro raised plantlets showed 90% survival in the field when transferred after hardening and acclimatization.\\'Abstract: \\'Mid-tropospheric cyclones are often observed on daily and monthly mean maps over southern Asia during the summer southwest monsson season. Although they are important activators of monsoon rains over certain regions, only a few observational studies are available, and even fewer theoretical and numerical studies have been performed. This article attempts to summarize the present observational knowledge about mid-tropospheric cyclones and reviews current ideas on the formation, maintenance and dissipation of these systems. A recent numerical simulation of a mid-tropospheric cyclone is described. In general, latent heat release plays the dominant role in the dynamics of the cyclone. Much is still to be learned about mid-tropospheric cyclones and several promising areas of future research are suggested.\\'Abstract: \\'New institutional economists have argued that there are many categories of institutions, including market and non-market institutions, which may prove economically efficient, specifically for public goods and common pool goods. The Government of India introduced a non-market community-based institution, known as Joint Forest Management (JFM), for forest management and protection in 1990. JFM is a sharing mechanism for forest planning and management based on sharing of rights and duties, control and decision-making authority over forestlands, between forest departments and local user groups. By 2001, 42 000 Village Forest Committees established under JFM were managing over 11.5 million ha forestland. These institutions have proved very useful, and have contributed to forest management as well as four aspects of sustainable human development (SHD) ecological output, income generation, village infrastructure development, and community empowerment. In the long-term, community-based institutions will prove to be a foundation of SHD and participatory democracy.\\'Abstract: \\'India is a vast country in terms of natural resources and considered one of the mega- biodiversity countries in the world. The freshwater aquatic resources of the different river basins are unevenly distributed in space and time and the country is suffering from the increasing population and shortage of all kind of natural resources like water. To fulfill the water demand and mitigate flood and drought, Indian Government has been planning a huge scheme encompassing the Himalayas and most of India, by linking all major rivers through interlinking canals systems and building several dams. Though the concept of interlinking of rivers is novel and new in India, it had rather initiated long back in other countries of ancient civilization. This is considered as one of the options to remedy spatial mismatch in water availability and demand. To overcome those, National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has taken up massive project and nearly 30 links have been proposed to interlink the major rivers. The Government of India has approved the first river interlinking project on and a MOU has been signed among the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh and the Union Government. The feasibility report of most of the links have been completed and detailed project reports of River link is expected to be finalized soon. Our study indicated presence of rich fish diversity and threatened fishes in river Betwa and improved aquatic environment in river Ken which makes it a high priority area in view of proposed interlinking. The current state of knowledge indicates that large dams, interbasin transfers and water withdrawal from rivers have many negative as well as positive impacts on freshwater aquatic ecosystem. As regards to the impact on fish and aquatic biodiversity, there could be positive as well as negative impacts. The present paper is aimed at explaining and synthesizing the long term plan and its implications, creating baseline database, requirement of appropriate technology, manpower and related issues especially with reference to riverine aquatic ecosystem and conservation of fish biodiversity.\\'Management of Biodiversity through Science and Technology\\'Abstract: \\'Prof. Menon, Distinguished Past Presidents and Fellows of the Academy, Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \"A general index of the second 25 volumes of \\'Kulturpflanze\\' (Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution) is provided.

Based on mean annual rainfall (MAR), four narrow climatic zones are identified in the basin, defined as and NICB ratio and anionic percentages polluted areas composing of 1818 samples. Hydrochemical facies are studied using Piper diagram, secondary alkalinity exceeded 50% and not one pair exceeded 50%, and plot, arid zone nearer to silicate pole indicated the dominance of SiO2 in Ca/Na vs Mg/Na plot. These geochemical variations emphasize a detailed study on role of climatic gradient on groundwater suitability for different purposes, for groundwater extraction, and its management. Suitability of groundwater for drinking based on water quality indices (WQI) indicated 98% of the samples as suitable TDS in humid zone is and in rest of the zones with in permissible range, 15% as hard water and not acceptable for drinking. Suitability of groundwater for irrigation is studied using sodium percentage (Na %), Wilcox diagram, sodium absorption ratio (SAR), US salinity diagram, residual sodium carbonate (RSC), permeability index (PI), ratio (KR), ancd magnesium absorption ratio (MgAR). Na % in four zones is and permissible for irrigation. Very few water samples fall in to and category of Wilcox diagram. Region is observed to have indicating that water would not cause any problem to the soil and crop. Humid and sub-humid zones belonged to C1S1 and C2S1 categories (low and medium sodium), while semi-arid extended to C3S1 category (salinity hazard zone) in US salinity plot. RSC for all the three zones ranged from 1 to with of the area safe for irrigation. Out of 1818 samples, 1129 belonged to class 2 of PI classification (PI ranging from 25 to 75%) while rest 689 samples had PI >75% (class 1). KR varied from 0.05 to 12.81, with of the area having MgAR ratio ranged from 67% to 96%, with sub-humid, humid zones having higher Mg concentrations (increased salinity). Thus, 90% of the samples indicated non-alkaline water with 1% of normal alkalinity. Hence, the current study systematically analyzed the effect of precipitation and geology on groundwater quality and on its usability for various purposes. This stepwise procedure categorized the regions, and the same can be adopted for any regional hydrogeochemical studies.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'This review is intended to contribute to the understanding of the interlinkage between wildfire in tropical dry forest (TDF) and selected ecosystem services (ES), namely forest provisioning and water regulating services, as well as biodiversity. TDF covers approximately of India, whereas according to the MODIS fire burns per year. As studies on wildfire effects upon ESs and biodiversity in Indian TDFs are rare we partly transferred findings from other (dry) forest areas to the environmental situation in India. In India (intentionally lit) wildfires have a very important connection to local livelihoods and the availability of non-wood forest products. Very important adverse long-term effects are the deterioration of forest ecosystems and soil degradation. The potential for TDF to regulate hydrological cycles is expected to be greater in the absence of fire than with it. A general judgment on the effect of fire on biodiversity is difficult as it depends on the community and species involved but a loss of biodiversity under regular burnings is apparent. Consequently, forest managers need sound knowledge regarding the interplay of wildfires and ecosystem behavior in general and more specific knowledge regarding the effects on taxa being considered for conservation efforts. Generally, much more research is needed to understand the trade-offs between the short-term benefits gained from forest provisioning services and long-term adverse effects.\\'Abstract: \\' Summary.

We assessed the perceived socio-ecological impacts of 4 SHPs within the Western Ghats in India by conducting semi-structured interviews with local respondents. Primary interview data were sequentially validated with secondary data, and respondent perceptions were subsequently compared against the expected baseline of assured impacts. We evaluated the level of awareness about SHPs, their perceived socio-economic impacts, influence on resource access and impacts on interactions. The general level of awareness about SHPs was low, and assurances of local electricity and employment generation remained largely unfulfilled. Additionally most respondents faced numerous unanticipated adverse impacts. We found a strong relationship between SHP construction and increasing levels of conflict. Based on the disparity between assured and actual social impacts, we suggest that policies regarding SHPs be suitably revised.\\'Abstract: \\'Eight natural populations ofVigna radiata wild relative of cultivated urd (V. mungoj and mung (V. radiata,) sampled from different ecozones of Palney Hills, an eastward offshoot of Western Ghats of Tamilnadu, India.

The present investigation aimed to explore the chemotypic and molecular variability in seven wild populations of R. cordifolia from South Eastern Ghats region of India. Thirty-eight individuals were assessed for molecular fingerprinting (ISSR markers) and densitometric quantification of purpurin and alizarin. The populations of Yelagiri Hills and Shervaroy Hills contained the highest levels of alizarin (0.115 and 0.093%, respectively) while Pachamalai and Kolli Hills revealed the highest purpurin content (0.284 and 0.280%, respectively). Genetic diversity was generally higher in the same populations that produced higher metabolite content, with the exception of Pachamalai, suggesting a highly prioritized conservation concern. The study revealed a total gene diversity at species level of 0.266 and of 0.187 at population level, with an average population genetic differentiation of 0.28. No clear genetic or chemical structure was retrieved between the studied populations, with individuals from different locations clustering together, and no significant correlation was obtained between metabolites and genetic diversity or between these and the geographic distances.\\'Abstract: \\'A morphometric analysis of Bharathapuzha river basin has been carried out using geoprocessing techniques in GIS.

The Bharathapuzha drainage basin is sprawled over an area of The study area was designated as seventh-order basin and lower order streams mostly dominate the basin with the drainage density value of The slope of basin varied from to and the slope variation is chiefly controlled by the local geology and erosion cycles. The elongation ratio of the basin is 0.57 indicating that the study area is elongated with moderate relief and steep slopes. The drainage texture of the basin is 7.78 which indicates an intermediate texture that exists over the region. Hence, from the study, it can be concluded that remote sensing data coupled with geoprocessing techniques prove to be a competent tool in morphometric analysis and the data can be used for basin management and other hydrological studies in future.\\'Abstract: \\'Conservation of biodiversity requires management higher than the species level of organization, particularly at the landscape scale. It is, however, difficult to manage each threatened species individually. Alternatively, management can focus on the ecosystems that contain these species, and on the landscapes containing the ecosystems. The relatively new discipline of landscape ecology provides insight into both landscape diversity and the species diversity, and suggests a theoretical and practical basis for conservation planning. The information on the biodiversity characteristics such as species richness and their spatial distribution, economic, and the ethno-botanical importance is of great significance to any nation. The Department of Biotechnology and Department of Space, Government of India funded a nationwide project between 1998 and 2010 to characterize and map the flowering plants richness in the natural (forests, grasslands, scrub, etc.) and man-made (forest plantations) vegetation formations at landscape level. The spatial database on vegetation types generated using wet and dry season satellite imagery and ancillary data such as topographic maps and the species richness through field inventory were used to generate the spatially-explicit species distribution maps and statistics. A customized software package, SPLAM (Spatial Landscape Modeling) was developed for landscape analysis and spatial data integration. This, first of its kind unique study spanning over has resulted in a large baseline spatial database on vegetation types, porosity, patchiness, interspersion, juxtaposition, fragmentation, disturbance regimes, ecosystem uniqueness, terrain complexity and the species richness. The field inventory involved 16,581 geo-referenced plots across India and 7,761 plant species. The geospatially-tagged species database, created in the project, provides information on the endemic, rare, endangered, threatened, and medicinally/economically important species. The database, disseminated to large number of organizations including State Forest Departments, has found extensive applications in policy planning, operational management, biodiversity conservation, bio-prospecting, and the climate change studies.\\'Abstract: \\'Despite the extensive use of small millet landraces as an important source of nutrition for people living in semi-arid regions, they are presently marginalized and their diversity and distribution are threatened at a global scale. Local farmers have developed ancient breeding programs entrenched in traditional knowledge (TK) that has sustained rural cultures for thousands of years. The convention on biological diversity seeks fair and equitable sharing of genetic resources arising from local knowledge and requires signatory nations to provide appropriate policy and legal framework to rights over plant genetic resources and associated TK. DNA barcoding employed in this study is proposed as a model for conservation of genetic diversity and an essential step towards documenting and protecting rights and TK. Our study focuses on 32 landraces of small millets that are still used by indigenous farmers located in the rain fed areas of rural India and Nepal. Traditional knowledge of traits and utility was gathered using participatory methods and semi-structured interviews with key informants. DNA was extracted and sequenced (rbcL, trnH-psbA and ITS2) from 160 samples. Both multivariate analysis of traits and phylogenetic analyses were used to assess diversity among small millet landraces. Our research revealed considerable variation in traits and DNA sequences among the 32 small millet landraces. We utilized a tiered approach using ITS2 DNA barcode to make accurate landrace (32 landraces) and species (six species) assignments for all 160 blind samples in our study. We have also recorded precious TK of nutritional value, ecological and agricultural traits used by local farmers for each of these traditional landraces. This research demonstrates the potential of DNA barcoding as a reliable identification tool and for use in evaluating and conserving genetic diversity of small millets. We suggest ways in which DNA barcodes could be used in the Protection of Plant Varieties and Rights in India and Nepal.\\'sampling\\'Abstract: \\'Density of tiger Panthera tigris and leopard Panthera pardus was estimated using photographic sampling in a tropical deciduous forest of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, southern India, from November 2008 to February 2009. A total of 2,000 camera trap nights for yielded 19 tigers and 29 leopards within an intensive sampling area of Population size of tiger from closed population estimator model Mb Zippin was 19 tigers and for leopards Mh Jackknife estimated 53 individuals. Spatially explicit maximum likelihood and Bayesian model estimates were 8.31 and 8.9 per for tigers and 13.17 and 13.01 per for leopards, respectively. Tiger density for MMDM models ranged from 6.07 to 9.72 per and leopard density ranged from 13.41 to 28.91 per Spatially explicit models were more appropriate as they handle information at capture locations in a more specific manner than some generalizations assumed in the classical approach. Results revealed high density of tiger and leopard in Mudumalai which is unusual for other high density tiger areas. The tiger population in Mudumalai is a part of the largest population at present in India and a source for the surrounding Reserved Forest.\\'Abstract: \\'We describe the activity patterns and time budget of a feral group of lion-tailed macaques that were confined to a disturbed forest fragment of 65 ha and compare the results with those obtained for groups in protected forests. The degraded nature of the study site was reflected in low tree densities, low specific diversity, gaps in the girth distribution of trees, and frequent disturbance by humans. The study group of 43 subjects was twice as large as lion-tailed macaque groups in protected habitats. They spent the most time ranging (34.0%), followed by foraging (23.7%), feeding (17.9%), resting (16.0%), and other activities such as social interactions (8.4%). Monthly variations are significant for all activity categories except ranging. Times spent resting and foraging are negatively correlated (r = and show significant seasonal differences. Foraging time was highest from September to November, when key food sources such asCullenia andArtocarpus were absent or marginally available. The study group spent most time (40.4%) at canopy levels between 21 and 30 m. They spent more time each day ranging than resting or feeding and more time terrestrially compared with groups in protected forests. Large group size, poor habitat quality, and seasonal variation in food availability were the major variables affecting their time budget, and these variables accounted for differences from the time budgets of groups in protected forests.\\'Abstract: \\'We studied time budgeting of lion-tailed macaques in the Anamalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Tamil Nadu, India, with regard to seven activity categories. Groups spent >50% of their time feeding and foraging, of the time resting, and 15% moving. More energetic activities were spread uniformly through the day. Feeding had two annual peaks: one closely following the northeast monsoon and the other corresponding to the southwest monsoon. These also coincided with peaks of food availability and mating. Time saved in feeding was spent mostly on resting. Ranging showed a pattern contrary to that of time spent moving and was related more to weather than to food availability; it increased during cooler periods. The middle and upper stories of the canopy were used >93% of the time. The ground was used rarely. Time budgeting characteristics of the lion-tailed macaque are primarily frugiinsectivorous adaptations to a wet evergreen forest habitat.\\'Abstract: \\'Scarcity of groundwater necessitates the present study to evaluate groundwater potential and quality for designing suitable water management plans in the Bhatsa and Kalu river basins in the Thane district in the western Deccan volcanic province of India. A Geographical Information System platform is used to integrate and spatially analyse multiparametric data comprised of satellite, topographical, geological and hydrogeological information to generate several thematic maps, including groundwater potential zonation map. This study reveals that 70% of the area has medium to low groundwater potential, while only 10% has high potential. The static and dynamic groundwater potentials are estimated to be 10.7 and 4.8% of the annual rainfall. The groundwater quality in terms of hardness, total dissolved solids, salinity and chloride is suitable for domestic and irrigational purposes. A database is developed for sustainable water management program for the region and areas where suitable water conservation techniques need to be adopted are identified.\\'Abstract: \\'Present investigation involving 28 stations of Western Karnataka and one of Kerala produces at least some evidence of the impact of deforestation on declining trends of rainfall and rainy days.

As the ecological role of the leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) in the intricate eastern Himalayan habitats is not known, we assessed the site occupancy, detection probability and activity pattern of leopard cats in Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve, India, based on sign surveys and camera trapping. The estimated site occupancy was and detection probability was Occupancy modelling indicated low elevation, high rodent abundance and tree cover as best predictors for the occupancy of leopard cat. Diet based on analysed scats revealed murids as the most dominant prey Information based on photographic captures indicated that the leopard cat exhibited a nocturnal activity pattern (peak activity between which coincided with its principal prey (revealed through diet analysis), but mainly contradicted with other sympatric competitors, hence indicating a temporal partitioning of resources among them. Ecological niche factor analysis indicated that the leopard cat exhibits high global marginality (1.32) and low global tolerance (0.275). The habitat suitability map for leopard cats showed majority of the habitat as unsuitable and predicted only areas of lower temperate forests as moderate to highly suitable. As highly suitable habitats of the leopard cat are in close proximity to villages, conflict issues are a major threat and therefore need to be addressed in conservation program for this felid.\\'Abstract: \\'Twenty-four species of sedges (representing six genera) from different vegetation types in Western Ghats, South India, were examined for vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) associations. All the sedges had VAM fungal infections with hyphae and vesicles, but arbuscules were observed only in 42% of the total species. The VAM fungal colonization varied considerably between species, ranging from 9 to 62%. Root colonization was positively and negatively correlated with root diameter and root hair length, respectively. The number of VAM fungal spores in the rhizosphere varied from 5 to 86 g-1 soil. No significant relationship was found between spore numbers or root colonization and either soil pH or moisture. Four Glomus spp., one Acaulospora sp., one Sclerocystis spp., and one Gigaspora sp. were identified among the VAM fungal spores. The results reflect a high incidence of VAM in sedges occurring in Western Ghats and emphasize the need to assess the VAM status of plant species from different ecosystems to understand their mycorrhizal status.\\'Abstract: \\'A combination of vertical electrical sounding (VES) and and stable isotope geochemistry is used in this study to trace out the extension of a dyke and for deciphering the subsurface piping phenomena in a landslide-affected hamlet, Pasukadavu, in the Western Ghats of Kerala, India. VES was successful in extracting three to four different subsurface layers characterized by differing resistivity. Two VES sections were prepared from 24 different VES locations, each one for understanding the dyke extension and for delineating subsurface conduits. The dyke was characterized by high resistivity of and shows varying thickness. In the second profile, the void zone, which is characteristic of piping, is delineated through a low resistivity zone (75 to and stable isotopes collected along the second VES profile show the same chemistry, indicating that it is the same water which flows all along the VES profile 2. A four-stage conceptual model was developed to illustrate and narrate the sequence of development of the piping phenomena and landslide activity.\\'Abstract: \\'The effects of short-term exposure (28 days) of free-feeding Limnonectus limnocharis (Indian cricket frog) tadpoles to field concentrations of malathion were investigated. This frog species is a major biotic component of the agroecosystems of the Western Ghats and where malathion (diethyl [(dimethoxy phosphino thioyl] butanediote), an organophosphate pesticide, is being used extensively. Although malathion is known to cause nonreversible acetylcholine inhibition and diminishes activity, growth and development in amphibian tadpoles, such data on Indian amphibian species are lacking. In the present study, increments in the following were used to assess such an impact: tadpole growth; increase in total length, body length, tail length, and body weight; and food consumption. The different concentrations of malathion employed were 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000 Malathion exposure produced significant effects on all measured parameters. Tadpole survival decreased from 20 to 6 tadpoles, with an increase in concentration followed by a decrease in growth. Food consumption of surviving tadpoles also decreased (0.067 to 0.0075 with increased malathion. Decreased food consumption, growth, and development of L. limnocharis tadpoles with an increase of malathion concentration (within field concentration range) over temporal scale reveal the possible threat to this species in the agroecosystems of the Western Ghats.\\'Abstract: \\'Present study deals with the vegetation type mapping, structure and composition analysis of the tropical forests, spread over 1,294 km2 area in South Andaman Islands. Seventeen vegetation classes spreading over 89.92% forested area of the islands were mapped with the overall accuracy of 88.89%. Evergreen, semi-evergreen and mangrove forests were reasonably well distributed forests, while moist deciduous and littoral evergreen were narrowly restricted. The stocking was quite variable across the forest types. 60.04% of forested area was under medium to high canopy density. Secondary and degraded forest types were mapped. Information on floristic composition, structure and diversity of various forest types were obtained from 84 field sample plots. An inventory of 423 species of plants from 101 families included 155 trees, 84 shrubs, 150 herbs and 84 climbers. Tree density and mean basal area ranged from 517 to 900 stems and 36.15 to 53.58 m2 respectively. Evergreen forests accounted for highest diversity followed almost equally by semi-evergreen and moist deciduous forests.\\'Abstract: \\'The scientific understanding of hydro-meteorological and agricultural changes in the water-scarce region is crucial to formulate a plan for sustainable management of water resources and cropping pattern under the scenario of climate change. The present investigation, therefore, has attempted to detect the trends in the monsoon rainfall, runoff, dam storage, post-monsoon groundwater (PMGW) levels, and agricultural data in the Karha Basin, located in the rain shadow zone of the Western Ghat. Additionally, trends in projected monsoon rainfall and average annual temperature were also analyzed. The study indicates no significant increase in monsoon rainfall over the basin during past and future The noteworthy decline in monsoon runoff has mainly resulted due to the effective implementation of surface water harvesting in the basin, which has a significant positive change in PMGW table in the basin. The study also provides evidence of the shift in agricultural pattern, where the rainfed crops are getting replaced by the high water-requiring/cash crops. It may increase the future agricultural water demand and pressurize the limited water resources in the basin. On the other hand, significant increase in near-term future (up to 2050) temperature can augment the water demand along with the adverse impacts on the agricultural productivity. The Karha Basin is already suffering from water deficiency. The man-induced increase in agricultural water demand and the adverse climatic changes in the Karha Basin are very likely to aggravate the future drought conditions and further add to an already difficult water management challenge in the basin.\\'Abstract: \\'The paper presents a geospatial modeling approach for the assessment of biological richness in Kuldiha wildlife sanctuary in Orissa located in the northern tip of the Eastern Ghats in India. Indian Remote Sensing satellite data of Resourcesat-1 LISS III and field sampling were used to model biological richness at 1:50,000 scale. It was found that the sanctuary is dominated by Sal mixed dry deciduous forest. The vegetation map prepared through visual interpretation of satellite imagery was subjected to landscape analysis and assessment of biotic disturbance using SPLAM software. The disturbance index together with species richness, ecosystem uniqueness, terrain complexity and total importance value was modeled to access the biological richness in the sanctuary. A total of 3.9 per cent area was found to posses very high plant richness followed by high (21.2%), medium (42.1%) and low (32.8%) in the sanctuary. The study demonstrated the geospatial technology in conjunction with landscape analysis, ground inventory and geospatial modeling seizes good potential for rapid assessment of biological richness. The fringe areas of the sanctuary having disturbance more because most of the small villages which are relocated from sanctuary, settled in those areas.\\'Abstract: \\'The gastropod fauna from continental waters comprises valid described species and a minimum of independent lineages of Recent Neritimorpha, Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia (including the Pulmonata). The caenogastropod component dominates in terms of species richness and diversity of morphology, physiology, life and reproductive modes and has produced several highly speciose endemic radiations. Ancient oligotrophic lakes (e.g., Baikal, Ohrid, Tanganyika) are key hotspots of gastropod diversity; also noteworthy are a number of lower river basins (e.g., Congo, Mekong, Mobile Bay). But unlike many other invertebrates, small streams, springs and groundwater systems have produced the most speciose associations of freshwater gastropods. Despite their ecological importance in many aquatic ecosystems, understanding of even their systematics is discouragingly incomplete. The freshwater gastropod fauna faces unprecedented threats from habitat loss and degradation and introduced fishes and other pests. Unsustainable use of ground water, landscape modification and stock damage are destroying many streams and springs in rural/pastoral areas, and pose the most significant threats to the large diversity of narrow range endemics in springs and ground water. Despite comprising only of the gastropod fauna, freshwater gastropods account for of recorded mollusc extinctions. However, the status of the great majority of taxa is unknown, a situation that is exacerbated by a lack of experts and critical baseline data relating to distribution, abundance, basic life history, physiology, morphology and diet. Thus, the already considerable magnitude of extinction and high levels of threat indicated by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is certainly a significant underestimate.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \"Major mountain environments of the world are delineated and all their protected areas (MTNPA) are listed by IUCN categories.

Accumulation of tourism activities has reached the critical stage in most of the tourism centers, which pose serious threats to the natural environment. The Bhyundar Valley of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) in Uttarakhand State of the Indian Himalaya is a burning example of such problems. Land use/cover changes, deforestation and accumulation of garbage are some of the negative impacts of unregulated tourism in the valley. Unsustainable activities of tourists and villagers in the valley make such problems very severe. To deal with the ongoing problems and ensure community involvement in tourism management and environmental conservation, the Biosphere Reserve Authority introduced ecotourism in the form of Eco Development Committees (EDCs) in the Bhyundar Valley. Study reveals that many problems associated with tourism have been minimized to some extent with the help of EDCs but few are still prevailing in valley. However, the existing attempts to conserve the valley from the negative effects of tourism are inadequate and modifications are needed in the current initiatives.\\'anticancer Plant\\'Abstract: \\'An efficient protocol has been established for rapid multiplication of Ophiorrhiza mungos Linn. (Rubiaceae), a potent anticancer plant. Axillary and terminal buds of these in vitro-raised seedlings formed the primary source of explants for direct organogenesis. Explants were inoculated onto MS medium supplemented with different concentrations and combinations of 6-benzylaminopurine (BA) and kinetin (KN). The best morphogenic response was observed on MS media supplemented with 0.25 mg BA and 0.25 mg KN, which exhibited the highest regeneration frequency (84%), the maximum number of shoots/explants (63.1 1.35) and shoot length (2.8 1.15) within 4 weeks. Fortification of 1.0 mg GA3 enhanced the shoot elongation by 2.33 fold in 91% of shoot cluster cultures within 3 weeks. A high percent frequency of rooting (92.13%) was achieved within 15 days of shoot implantation on strength MS media fortified with 100 mg activated charcoal. The rooted plantlets were successfully acclimatized with 95% survival rate. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis confirmed that all the regenerated plants were genetically identical to their mother plant, suggesting an absence of detectable genetic variation in the regenerated plantlets. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was done to further confirm the existence of qualitative and quantitative differences in the major secondary metabolite (camptothecin) between the mother plant and in vitro-propagated plants. The present results evidently showed comparable chemical profiles. Thus, the present protocol can be used for clonal mass propagation of true-to-type elite O. mungos plants.\\'Abstract: \\'The Bandipur National Park situated in the Western Ghats of Karnataka State, is one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. During recent years, this park has witnessed repeated fires, affecting considerable areas under vegetation. The temporal satellite data from 1997 to 2006 have been analyzed to map the burnt areas using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. The vegetation cover is moist deciduous, dry deciduous, scrub forests and teak plantation. Information on extent of the burnt areas and the type of vegetation affected were derived forest range-wise. The fire prone regions have been identified by integrating vegetation type/density, road and settlement network and past history of forest fire occurrence, by assigning subjective weightage according to their fire-inducing capability or their sensitivity to fire. Comparison between each temporal dataset in terms of the extent of burnt area was also carried out to interpret fire incidence pattern. Three categories of fire risk regions such as Low, Moderate and High fire intensity zones were identified and it was found that almost 40% of the study area falls under low risk zone. An evaluation of the existing fire management systems and the implication of fire prevention programmes has been discussed, besides an assessment of causal factors for fire incidence in the park.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Mosses are one of the dominant plant communities at higher elevations in the Himalaya and play an important role in the ecosystem dynamics. The authors assessed the diversity of mosses in the Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (KWLS) of Garhwal Himalaya, India.

Development and other anthropogenic activities have led to degradation of forest land, and ultimately, it results in loss of biodiversity and increases concentration of CO2 in atmospheres. Therefore, there is urgent need to estimate regional and national level carbon stock for making forest-based policies and strategies for mitigation of CO2. Patchy and sporadic information is available on biomass and carbon stock of Indian forests. The paper presents a systematic review and comprehensive account of studies conducted in different forest types in India.\\'Abstract: \\'Distribution and status of Indian Giant Flying Squirrel (Petaurista philippensis Elliot) have been assessed in the state of Rajasthan, India.

Simultaneously, a growing number of conflicts against large-scale wind farms are emerging in multiple locations around the world. As these processes occur, new questions arise on how electricity from wind is being generated, how such energy is flowing within societies, and how these production-flows are being shaped by specific power structures. The present paper explores the expanding geography of wind energy conflicts by analyzing 20 case studies from across the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe. Based on the Environmental Justice Atlas database, it reflects on how land pressures and patterns of uneven development emerge as two features of the current expansion of wind farms. Following a relational analysis, these patterns are examined to interpret the plural instances of opposition emerging throughout the rural spaces of the world. The article argues that previously unexplored forms of collective action are expanding the scope and content of the energy In addition to the claims of and addressed by the existing literature, this study sheds light on the rural/peripheral contexts where opposition emerges through the defense of indigenous livelihoods and communal development projects. The study contends that these embrace an environmental justice perspective the socially unequal and geographically uneven patterns reproduced by the ecological modernization paradigm. From this lens, cases of local opposition are not interpreted as selfish forces blocking a low-carbon transition, but instead, are understood as political instances that enable a wider discussion about the ways such take place.\\'Abstract: \"Forest gardens are reconstructed natural forests, in which wild and cultivated plants coexist, such that the structural characteristics and ecological processes of natural forests are preserved, although the species composition has been adapted to suit human needs. These agroforests include a range of modified and transformed forests, and form an integral part of local land-use systems. They lie between natural forests and tree-crop plantations in terms of their structure and composition, and low intensity of forest extraction systems and the high intensity plantation systems in terms of their management intensity. Their management is characterized by combined use of silvicultural and horticultural operations, and spatial and temporal variations. These ecologically sustainable systems are often dynamic in species composition in response to changing socioeconomic conditions. Evolved over a long period of time as a result of local community\\'s creativity, forest gardens have still received little attention in agroforestry research, just as in the case of the more intensively domesticated homegardens. The study of forest gardens offers good opportunities for obtaining a better understanding of the agroforestry systems and for developing multifunctional agroforestry systems combining production and biodiversity values.\"Abstract: \\'Biodiversity is the very basis of human survival and economic well-being, and encompasses all life forms, ecosystems and ecological processes. The current estimates of the total number of species on earth vary from 5 to more than with a more conservative figure of species. Of these, only species have yet been described and awarded scientific names. Thus, our knowledge of diversity is remarkably incomplete. Biodiversity at any point in time is the balance between the rates of speciation and extinction. Biodiversity is not uniformly distributed on the earth and shows prominent latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. At least five major mass extinctions have occurred in the past at geologic-time boundaries. Studies indicate that we have entered into the sixth phase of mass extinctions. In all ecosystem types, terrestrial, freshwater and marine, species populations are declining. The current rates of species extinction are times higher than the background rate of year inferred from fossil record. It is now in the order of 1,000 species per decade per million species. Today we seem to be losing two to five species per hour from tropical forests alone. This amounts to a loss of populations/year or 1,800 populations/h. Major drivers for changes of biodiversity in future, in decreasing rank of their impact are land use change, climate change, N deposition, biotic exchange and atmospheric loading of CO2. Accuracy of estimates of the total number of resident species and current rates of extinction remains undetermined, and the impact of species deletions on ecosystem function and stability is still a subject of debate among ecologists. There are two basic, often complementary strategies for biodiversity conservation. The in situ strategy emphasizes the protection of ecosystems for the conservation of overall diversity of genes, populations, species, communities and the ecological processes which are crucial for ecosystem services. Establishment of networks of protected areas are effective in this regard as these have the possibility to conserve primary forests and red-listed ecosystems. The concept of biodiversity banking could induce public participation. Establishment of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, an independent, international science panel (like IPCC) would help coordinate and highlight research on pressing topics, conduct periodic assessments on regional as well as global scales and provide predictions.\\'Abstract: \\'Nepal is considered a leader among developing nations with regard to conservation legislation and programs; it was among the first Asian nations to develop national conservation legislation, sign CITES, and develop a national conservation strategy. We review the history of modern conservation law in Nepal from the Rana period (early 1950s) to the present. The early legislation focused mainly on strict preservation of areas and species; this phase culminated in the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1973. Subsequent legislation has evolved more in the direction of an integrated, holistic approach to conservation and is beginning to incorporate the participation of local people; subsequent amendments to the 1973 act allowed greater rights to rural villagers, and the designation of conservation areas in addition to the more strictly defined protected areas (national parks, wildlife reserves, etc.).\\'Abstract: \\'The main methods of preserving the plant biodiversity are reviewed.

We used an interview schedule with open-ended questions to solicit Soliga opinion on Lantana camara (lantana) invasion. The Soliga cited three reasons for lantana spread: its prolific fruit output and wide seed dispersal, change in fire management, and historical extraction of grass and bamboo. The Soliga believe that lantana invasion has had negative effects on the ecosystem and their livelihoods. Tabling scientific knowledge with local knowledge has improved our understanding of lantana invasion. The role of existing lantana in colonizing neighboring areas, and the response of native tree communities to lantana were common to both local and scientific sources. However, the Soliga view provides a more nuanced perspective of the lantana-fire relationship (contextually based on lantana density) with fires suppressing lantana when lantana density was low. This is contrary to views held by foresters and biologists, that fires are uniformly detrimental and promote lantana. Our study shows that examining Soliga observations has improved understanding of the invasion process and presents avenues for future lantana management.\\'Abstract: \\'A high frequency plant regeneration system was developed for the production of high yielding elite clones of Garcinia indica via direct organogenesis. A maximum number of 86.2 shoot buds per explant were induced from the mature seed segments cultured on Woody plant medium (WPM) supplemented with 2.0 mg N6-benzyladenine and 1 mg indole-3-acetic acid. Rooting was achieved on half-strength WPM medium supplemented with 3 mg indole-3-butyric acid. Rooted plantlets were acclimatized and transferred to greenhouse for further growth. The highest survival rate of 95 % was recorded using a mixture of garden soil and sand. Histological studies clearly revealed multiple shoot formation from mature seed segments.\\'Abstract: \\'1. Vinson V (2016) Spatial organization inside the nucleusScience353 598.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'The biodiversity hotspot concept was defined by Myers in 1988 to determine priority areas for conservation. They have high endemism levels and have lost the Phytoseiidae (Acari), one of the best known among the order Mesostigmata, in these threatened areas. These mites are usually predators and they are worldwide spread. Geographic distribution of phytoseiids in 27 biodiversity hostspots was assessed from data of the last world catalogue published in 2004. One thousand two hundred and thirty species are reported from at least one hotspot (62% of the total species number) and 604 species (30% of the total species number) are endemic to the 27 hotspots considered. The number of reports/publication in hotspot areas (2.6) is higher than in non-hotspot zones (1.5). Hotspots areas could be thus considered as a great reservoir of the Phytoseiidae diversity, just as they are for vertebrates and plants. Correlations between plant, vertebrate, mite diversity and endemism, as well as congruence rates between endemism levels of these three organisms suggest that the biodiversity patterns of plants and vertebrates mirror well those of the Phytoseiidae (both for endemicity and species richness). More intense conservation efforts in biodiversity hotspots would thus be assumed to affect plant and vertebrate biodiversity, as already known, but also arthropod biodiversity, as it was assumed. These results further support thus the importance of these zones in biodiversity conservation, even for organisms like mites, very small and poorly studied in this regards. More data on arthropods are, however, required to confirm these preliminary observations.\\'Abstract: \\'An analysis of human population trends from 2000 to 2010 shows that of the roughly one billion additional people on the planet today, a disproportionate number live in the biodiversity hotspots and tropical wilderness areas (TWAs). Although the annual population growth rate in the hotspots declined from 1.6 to the total population increased by 187 million people. While less densely populated, the TWAs grew at roughly twice the rate of the hotspots. Overall, slower growth rates are indicative of longer-term global trends in decreasing fertility, aging populations, and increased urbanization. The hotspots, however, are largely inhabited by people who have yet to enter their reproductive years or are in the early stages therein. The young age structure means that populations in these priority conservation areas will grow even as fertility rates fall further, and biodiversity will be forced to share dwindling natural habitat with ever more people.\\'Abstract: \\'Nilgiri tahr, the only wild representative of the Caprinae subfamily in Southern India, is endangered due to population decline, decreasing range size and limited geographical distribution, which together with habitat loss and fragmentation, further reduce its long-term viability. Planning conservation and management strategies to rehabilitate the species will require information on its population status and genetics. With an objective to assess the population genetics of Nilgiri tahr, we identified a panel of polymorphic microsatellite markers that amplify across the Caprinae species. We screened 50 pellet samples collected from four herds belonging to the largest remnant population of Nilgiri tahr in Eravikulam National Park, with 19 microsatellite markers, of which 17 polymorphic markers were selected for further tests. We observed varied levels of polymorphism alleles) and heterozygosity Probability of identity for individuals was 0.0018 at 10 loci and for siblings was 0.0062 at 13 loci, signifying the usefulness of these markers to study wild herds. Overall, observed and expected heterozygosities were H and H respectively, and the F IS value was 0.0138 Our results validate the use of cross-species markers in wild populations of Nilgiri tahr to identify individuals and determine genetic diversity, which can be further used to understand population dynamics of this species.\\'Abstract: \\'Traditional medicine in India can be classified into codified (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy) and non-codified (folk medicine) systems. Both the systems contributing equally to the primary healthcare in India. The present study is aimed to understand the current scenario of medicinal practices of non-codified system of traditional medicine in Belgaum region, India.\\'Abstract: \\'Arjinshan National Nature Reserve (ANNR) is one of 3 refuges of the endemic ungulates Tibetan wild ass (Equus kiang), Chiru (Pantholops hodgsonii) and wild yak (Bos mutus) that are endangered by natural and anthropogenic factors in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Identifying habitat suitability is critical for species protection management. We used a GIS-based niche model to delimit and classify habitat suitability using an integrated assessment system, which included 9 biotic and abiotic factors. We divided the research area into 4 habitat types for these ungulates: (1) high suitability habitat; (2) moderate suitability habitat; (3) low suitability habitat; and (4) unsuitable area. Results suggested that chiru have the most areas of high and moderate suitability habitats while Tibetan wild ass had the largest areas of low suitability habitat and unsuitable area. Wild yak had the largest area of moderate and low suitability habitat, but high suitability habitats for wild yak were smaller than those of other 2 ungulates. There was overlap of high-quality habitat for the three kinds of ungulates in the vicinity of Kardun inspection station, which could be regarded as the core area for the coexistence and conservation of these endangered ungulate populations.\\'Abstract: \\'Ceropegia bhatii S. R. Yadav & Shendage, discovered from Malebennur Ghat in Davangere district of Karnataka State is described and illustrated. It is similar to Ceropegia noorjahaniae M. A.

Adult Asian elephant females and their young offspring of both sexes form matriarchal groups, with pubertal males dispersing from natal groups, but whether these social groups represent families and whether males show locational or social dispersal were unknown. Using nuclear microsatellite loci amplified from dung-extracted DNA of free-ranging elephants in a large southern Indian population, we demonstrate that female-led herds comprise closely related individuals that are indeed families, and that males exhibit non-random locational dispersal.\\'Abstract: \\'Coastal region of Maharashtra was tectonically active during Mio-Pliocene peroid, and subsequently exogenetic processes were more powerful.

Six species are most commonly extracted from BRT scrub for subsistence and income generation by an aboriginal tribe, the Soliga. Although the forest has been provided protection from indiscriminate felling since 1978 under a wildlife sanctuary cover, changes in vegetation structure are still occurring as a consequence of anthropogenic pressure in the form of extraction of fuelwood and other NTFPs. The results indicate that large woody species are being replaced by small woody species. The population structure also is becoming increasingly skewed to the smaller size classes due to extraction-bound mortality of the individuals, particularly those>7 cm dbh and above. The data suggest that the scrub community itself may be a manifestation of long persisting anthropogenic pressure in the form of extraction of a variety of forest products, and it currently represents a downward transition from a deciduous forest to a shrub thicket.\\'Abstract: \\'The advent of modern forces and the changes in socioeconomic patterns of forest dwellers have increased the pressures on the forests. In order to mitigate such pressures and also to protect the forests and wildlife the model of protected areas networks has shifted and enhanced such pressures in the unprotected natural forests due to several reasons. Being a low profile category of protected status and continuous human settlements, the present study highlights the case of dry deciduous forests of Sarguja district of Chhattisgarh state of India. The major objectives of this study were to quantify the status of forests and wildlife and also to determine the extent of anthropogenic disturbances faced by the dry deciduous forests of central India. Transect and silent drive count methods were used for sampling wildlife and quadrat method was used for sampling vegetation. Besides, the local uses of various forest produces were also studied in view of understanding the people dependency on forests. The forest vegetation, in the study area, was pre-dominated by Shorea robusta, which had Madhuca indica, Diospyrus melanoxylon and Buchnania lanzan as the major companion species. The forest had either the high girth class mature tree species or the saplings. The low vegetation cover and density were due to the high anthropogenic pressures mainly in the form of heavy livestock grazing and collection of ethnobotanically important species. The study though reveals that the area is not rich in wildlife and the forest is fragmented, the area still supports some important species, which include many rare and endangered plants and animals. The findings of this study have been discussed in view of the management and conservation of the forest and wildlife in the dry deciduous forests.\\'Abstract: \\'The Cauvery river basin of South India has a large phyto-floristic wealth, rightfully enough to constitute a separate phyto-geographic unit. Increase in the anthropogenic pressures within the river basin and surrounding landscapes have persistently stressed the riparian ecosystem structure adversely, besides altering its composition. The objective of this study was to examine the present status of riparian vegetation along the Cauvery river basin, in response to anthropogenic pressures. For vegetation analysis, the riparian forest coming in the middle stretch of Cauvery river was categorized into two zones, viz., forest zone covering stretch and agroecosystem zone covering stretch. In each zone, tree species were quantified using transects at 8-km interval. Overall tree species accounting for both forest and agroecosystem were recorded and compared. The results indicate that the mean density and basal area of trees per plot were higher in the forest zone than agroecosystem zone. The diversity of forest zone is 4.6, which is higher than agroecosystem. In addition, species composition indicated a relatively low or poor similarity between the two zones. The vegetation density and site disturbance scores for all the study sites reveals that sand mining and grazing areas have exerted negative impact on riparian forest. The results of the present study clearly brought out the need for preparing and implementing site-specific conservation plans for riparian ecosystem.\\'Abstract: \\'From March 2007 to March 2009 we quantified plant diversity at Chilapatta Reserve Forest in Terai Duars in the Indian eastern Himalayas. We sampled stratified random nested quadrats. Species richness was 311, representing 167 genera and 81 families. The species diversity index and concentration of dominance of the forest were 2.20 and 0.0072, respectively. Shannon-Wiener index and evenness indices were 4.77 and 1.44, respectively. The Importance Value Index (IVI) of species ranged from 0.13 to 37.94. The estimated diversity indices indicated heterogeneity of the forest in its composition, structure, function and dynamics. Rich forest plant diversity supports the need for continued conservation of tropical forests.\\'Abstract: \\'Ideally, the estimates of biological diversity of a community of species in a habitat should refer to the biological variation among the species and not merely to their numbers and frequencies. However, the current estimates of biodiversity incorporate only the latter two components but not the biological differences among the species. Ganeshaiah et al. [(1997) Current Science 73: have proposed an estimate called the Avalanche Index (AI) that can incorporate the biological heterogeneity among the species in a habitat. This estimate, besides being methodologically simple, can incorporate any quantifiable differences among the species, information on species richness and their frequencies in the habitat. In this paper we have estimated AI for tree vegetation in 14 forest types across different ecosystems of the world and have compared these estimates with other indices being currently used. Through this we have attempted to analyse the relative utility of AI in discriminating the habitats based on their biological heterogeneity by capturing their intra-community biological variation. We discuss the merits and demerits of the AI as a comprehensive estimate of biological diversity.\\'Abstract: \\'This study attempts to review the various biodiversity related parameters envisaged in the current national forest inventory (NFI) of India in comparison to those used worldwide as indicators of forest biodiversity. The study reveals that a good amount of biodiversity related parameters are available, covering the structural attribute of biodiversity, tree species composition, and other important functional attributes like deadwood and litter. In spite of this timber-based approach, a number of variables are available to talk on biodiversity aspects of Indian forests. However, the comparison with the parameters found in literature shows that the scope of further improvement does exist in current ability to contribute towards a documentation and management of biodiversity. Our gap analysis indicates that enhancing the capacity of the current NFI to generate overall biodiversity information urgently required for safeguarding and conserving the natural wealth of India is strongly needed.\\'Abstract: \\'The primary objective of this study is to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) for environment conservation and analyze factors influencing WTP. A questionnaire survey based on the contingent valuation method (CVM) was carried out at Kanas Nature Reserve, Xinjiang, China. Seventy-three percent of the 412 respondents were willing to pay at different levels, and the mean WTP value was RMB 54.60 ($8.03). The results of this survey struck an optimistic note that publics were willing to contribute to improve environmental quality. Logistic regression analysis was employed to compare the characteristics of those who were and were not willing to pay. Chi-square tests were administered to identify the relationships between various explanatory factors and WTP. Conclusions and implications of the empirical study can be provided to policy makers and site managers. In a wider sense, the findings of this study should make a good contribution to the literature related to WTP for environment conservation of natural attractions.\\'Abstract: \\'A review of current work in India on modelling experiments is presented. The experiments are designed to simulate different features of the Indian summer monsoon. The first part of the paper summarises the basic structure of a model, and the problems of computational design. Different grid structures and transformation of the vertical coordinate to include mountains are discussed. Experiments are suggested for minimising truncation errors by using different reference atmospheres, and by normal mode initialisation. A brief account is provided of the use of finite elements for numerical models.\\'Abstract: \\'Analysis of flotation samples from twelve sites in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh (south India) provides clear evidence for the predominant subsistence plants of the Neolithic period b.c.). This evidence indicates that the likely staples were two pulses (Vigna radiata and Macrotyloma uniflorum) and two millet-grasses (Brachiaria ramosa and Setaria verticillata) which were indigenous to the Indian peninsula. At some sites there is evidence for limited cultivation of wheats (Triticum diococcum, Triticum durum/aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare), and a few crops that originated in Africa, including hyacinth bean (Lablab purpureus), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and finger millet (Eleusine coracana). In addition there is evidence for cotton (Gossypium sp.), and linseed (Linum sp.), as well as gathered fruits of Ziziphus and two Cucurbitaceae. This evidence suggests that the earliest agriculture in south India, dating to the third millennium b.c., was based on plants domesticated in the region, and that subsequently from the late 3rd millennium b.c. through the 2nd millennium additional crops from other regions were adopted into the subsistence system.\\'Abstract: \\' Shorea robusta Gaertn. f. (Sal) is one of the important timber-yielding plants in India, which dominates the vegetation of Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh state in India forming various communities based on its associations. The present study deals with delineation, mapping and characterization of various communities of Sal (Shorea robusta) forests in Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh, India ranging across over 16 districts. Field survey and visual interpretation based forest vegetation type classification and mapping was carried out as part of the project entitled characterization at landscape level using remote sensing and Indian Remote Sensing-P6 (Resourcesat-1) Linear Imaging Self Scanner-III satellite data was used during the study. The total area covered by different Sal forests was found to be approximately 2256.77 km2. Sal communities were identified and characterized based on their spectral properties, physiognomy and phytosociological characteristics. Following nine Sal communities were identified, delineated and mapped with reasonable accuracy viz., Chandar, Damar, dry plains, moist plains, western alluvium, western alluvium plains, mixed moist deciduous, mixed dry deciduous and Siwalik. It is evident from the area estimates that mixed moist deciduous Sal is the most dominant community in the region covering around (1613.90 km2), other major communities were found as western alluvium plains Sal (362.44 km2), mixed dry deciduous Sal (362.44 km2) and dry plains Sal (107.71 km2). The Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh faces tremendous anthropogenic pressure leading to deterioration of the forests. Community level information could be used monitoring the status as well as for micro level conservation and planning of the Sal forests in Terai Landscape of Uttar Pradesh.\\'Abstract: \\'The genus Xenikophyton is reduced to synonymy under Schoenorchis.

We conducted a fully factorial nitrogen and water (three levels each) treatment field experiment in the herbivore rich South Indian Western Ghats region to determine the seasonal pattern and the extent to which nitrogen and water availability limit herbaceous production. Graminoid production was found to be nitrogen limited. Despite low rainfall, additional water did not significantly increase overall biomass production nor extend growth in the dry season. Accumulated standing biomass was highest in the late wet season (November) and lowest in the dry season (May). Leaf nitrogen was highest in the early wet season (June) and lowest in the late dry season (March). Grazing had a positive effect on grass production by extending the growing season. Biomass production and graminoid leaf nitrogen concentration levels in the study area were similar to other tropical areas in the world. Also similar to other tropical large herbivore areas, the dry season poses an annual challenge for large herbivores in the study area the smaller bodied satisfy their nutrient requirements.\\'Abstract: \\'The reasons behind sexual segregation in animals are many.

This issue may be effectively addressed through sequestration of carbon in plants and soils. Here we studied the potential of vetiver, Vetiveria zizanioides L., to sequester carbon in field plots in Bangalore, India. Vetiver is a perennial and economically viable crop growing in tropical and subtropical regions. Vetiver has medicinal and aromatic properties. Vetiver shoot and root C amounts were measured. Results show that vetiver sequesters in shoot and roots, much higher than that for lemongrass with 5.38, palmarosa with 6.14, and trees with 2.92. In addition the benefit/cost ratio of vetiver, 2.3, is higher than that of rice, 1.97. We estimate that vetiver cropping could sequester per year in India, which is nearly of C emissions in India.\\'Abstract: \\'This study investigates the influence of changes in spatial urbanization on the hydrological processes of Upper Bhima River basin of Maharashtra state, India using Soil and Water Assessment Tool hydrological model based simulations. The simulated and observed monthly stream flow rates at the basin outlet were compared for calibration and validation of the SWAT model. For both the periods, efficiency values were root mean square error observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) values were and percent bias values were Hence, with coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.89 and 0.96 both the periods showed good agreement between simulated and observed stream flow rates. Urbanization indicators viz. population urbanization level (U p ) and spatial urbanization level (U s ) were estimated to quantify the growth patterns in population and urban areas respectively. Further, correlation analysis and Multivariate analysis of variance were performed between U s  and hydrological variables to study the influence of spatial urbanization on hydrological components for comprehending the existing relationships between them. Results reveal that from 1992 to 2014 with increase in U s  of 1.44 to 6.31, the average annual surface runoff increased from 438.22 to [standard deviation sum of squares whereas percolation decreased from 153.53 to These hydrological parameters are highly influenced by increase in urbanization. This study is relevant for water sources planners and policy makers for assessment of water resources for sustainable development in the urbanizing semi-arid river basins.\\'Abstract: \\'A collaborative crop specific exploration and collection mission to collect the germplasm and to study the population size of male and female/hermaphrodite trees of Malabar tamarind [Garcinia cambogia (Gaertn.) Desr.] in the area of its diversity was undertaken during July 2002 in Kerala and Karnataka. A total of 56 accessions of Malabar tamarind were collected. Two collections of Malabar tamarind were found to be very specific because of the uncommon fruit colour, which is pinkish red. All the collected accessions are grown at National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) Regional Station, Thrissur for characterisation and conservation. Extensive range of variability was found in fruit colour, shape, size and nature of branching and canopy of trees. Characterisation of 13 fruit and five seed characters was done for 51 accessions. The variability was found to be maximum for nipple length (74.8%) and minimum for fruit girth (12.8%). Two promising accessions were identified based on mean fruit weight in IC 354028 and mean rind thickness and mean rind weight in IC 354019.\\'Abstract: \\'High-frequencyin vitro flowering is reported here fromin vitro regenerated shoots ofin vitro-raised seedlings of rare and endemicCeropegia lawii, Ceropegia maccannii, Ceropegia oculata, andCeropegia sahyadrica, as well as the widely distributedCeropegia bulbosa var.bulbosa andCeropegia hirsuta. In our first set of experiments, the MS medium contained 87 mM sucrose and was supplemented with varying concentrations of BAP (4.4 to 26.6 For the second set of trials, varying concentrations of sucrose (87 to 233 mM) were tested in MS media containing a constant 4.4 p.M BAP. Sub-cultured apical as well as axillary buds flowered with similar frequencies after 30 d of incubation. For all six species, the highest percentage of flowering shoots was obtained with either 26.6 BAP or 175 mM sucrose. Although smaller in size, theirin vitro flowers were morphologically comparable within wVo-derived flowers. Variations among species were noted for the number of flower buds per shoot and the percentage of flower formation. Because all six species showed similar responses in both experiments, we can suggest that this protocol is applicable across the wide range ofCeropegia species.\\'Ceropegia santapaui \\'Abstract: \\'Ceropegias has acquired significant importance due to their medicinal properties, edible tubers, and its ornamental flowers. The aim of this study was to optimize direct shoot organogenesis (DSO), indirect shoot organogenesis (ISO) and plant regeneration of threatened medicinal plant Ceropegia santapaui, followed by analysis of genetic status and biochemical characterization of micropropagated plantlets. For optimization, cotyledonary nodes and cotyledons were used as source of explants in DSO and ISO respectively. The highest frequency of regeneration for DSO with shoots per explant was obtained from cotyledonary nodes cultured on Murashige and (MS) medium containing 2iP. The best response for callus induction and proliferation was achieved with PR (picloram) in which of cultures produced an average of (fresh weight) of callus. The highest frequency of shoot formation with an average of shoots in ISO was obtained when calli were transferred to MS medium supplemented with BAP and IBA. Regenerated shoots were best rooted in half-strength MS medium with NAA. Plantlets successfully acclimatized were morphologically indistinguishable from the source plant. Micropropagated plantlets subjected to random amplified polymorphic DNA and inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) marker based profiling reveled uniform banding pattern in DSO-derived plantlets which was similar to mother plant. ISSR fingerprints of ISO-derived plants showed low variation. Method of regeneration, plant part and solvent system significantly affected the levels of total phenolics, flavonoids and antioxidant capacity. Assay of antioxidant activity of different tissues revealed that significantly higher antioxidant activity was observed in ISO-derived tissues than DSO-derived and mother tissues. RP-HPLC analysis of micropropagated plantlets showed the presence of three major phenolic compounds which were similar to those detected in mother plant. Rapid multiplication rate, genetic stability and biochemical parameter ensures the efficacy of the protocol developed for the propagation of this threatened medicinal plant.\\'Abstract: \\'A wide range of speculation regarding lithospheric thermal thickness in a region calls for quantifying the uncertainties associated with model parameters. In this paper, we present an attempt to decipher it by solving the differential equations governing the heat transfer through the lithosphere. Adequately quantifying the temperature field is very important, since it is highly dependent on the controlling thermal parameters. Thermal conductivity is modeled as a random parameter with a known mean value and correlation structure. We compute the temperatures in the crust and lithospheric mantle, along with their error bounds, using an analytical solution to the steady-state heat equation and the Adomian method of decomposition. We apply these solutions in the Archean Dharwar craton, which is divided into western Dharwar craton (WDC) and eastern Dharwar craton (EDC). We obtain a Moho temperature estimate of in WDC, whilst in EDC it is for a 20% coefficient of variability in thermal conductivity. The range of lithospheric thickness obtained for WDC is and for the EDC. These values are in agreement with other geophysical and geological findings in the region. The thermal lithosphere obtained from this study is based on the mantle solidus and the surface wave seismological studies considering radial anisotropy reveal that the lithosphere is characterized by higher shear wave velocities, and decrease at the boundary. Average shear velocity model for two different cratonic blocks (EDC and WDC) is used to show the LAB thickness for the eastern and western Dharwar craton. The two independent studies show a correlation in the lithospheric thickness.\\'Abstract: \\'Globally, ultramafic outcrops are renowned for hosting floras with high levels of endemism, including plants with specialised adaptations such as nickel or manganese hyperaccumulation. Soils derived from ultramafic regoliths are generally nutrient-deficient, have major cation imbalances, and have concomitant high concentrations of potentially phytotoxic trace elements, especially nickel. The South and Southeast Asian region has the largest surface occurrences of ultramafic regoliths in the world, but the geoecology of these outcrops is still poorly studied despite severe conservation threats. Due to the paucity of systematic plant collections in many areas and the lack of georeferenced herbarium records and databased information, it is not possible to determine the distribution of species, levels of endemism, and the species most threatened. However, site-specific studies provide insights to the ultramafic geoecology of several locations in South and Southeast Asia. The geoecology of tropical ultramafic regions differs substantially from those in temperate regions in that the vegetation at lower elevations is generally tall forest with relatively low levels of endemism. On ultramafic mountaintops, where the combined forces of edaphic and climatic factors intersect, obligate ultramafic species and hyperendemics often occur. Forest clearing, agricultural development, mining, and climate change-related stressors have contributed to rapid and unprecedented loss of ultramafic-associated habitats in the region. The geoecology of the large ultramafic outcrops of Sulawesi, Obi and Halmahera, and many other smaller outcrops in South and Southeast Asia, remains largely unexplored, and should be prioritised for study and conservation.\\'Abstract: \\'Carbon forestry mitigation potential estimates at the global-level are limited by the absence or simplicity of national-level estimates, and similarly national-level estimates are limited by absence of regional-level estimates. The present study aims to estimate the mitigation potential for a large diverse country such as India, based on the GTAP global land classification system of agro-ecological zones (AEZs), as well the Indian AEZ system. The study also estimates the implications of carbon price incentive (US$50 and $100) on mitigation potential in the short-, medium- and long-term, since afforestation and reforestation (A & R) is constrained by lack of investment and financial incentives. The mitigation potential for short and long rotation plantations and natural regeneration was estimated using the GCOMAP global forest model for two land area scenarios. One scenario included only wastelands and the second enhanced area scenario, included wastelands plus long fallow and marginal croplands Under the $100 carbon price case, significant additional area under the wasteland scenario and under the enhanced area scenario) and carbon mitigation is gained in the short-term (2025) compared to the baseline when using the GTAP land classification system. The area brought under A & R increases by for the $100 carbon price compared to $50 carbon price in the short-term, indicating the effectiveness of higher carbon price incentives, especially in the short-term.\\'Abstract: \\'The bird fauna of logged and unlogged forest in Kibale National Park, western Uganda were studied and comparisons made. Species diversity and richness were higher in the logged areas. A single species, the Yellow-whiskered Greenbul Andropadus latirostris dominated in the logged compartment. However, the majority of individual birds found in the logged forest were generalist or forest-edge species. Over 84% of the forest interior specialist species that occurred in primary forest had recolonized or persisted in the logged forest; however, there were seven out of 48 understorey forest specialists that had not done so. Although there was moderate species overlap between the two habitats, the logged forest compartment had not fully recovered from logging after 23 years.\\'Abstract: \\' Nothapodytes nimmoniana is an endemic endangered tree and convenient source for large scale isolation of anticancer alkaloid camptothecin. Due to indiscriminate collection of its wood chips for camptothecin, population of the species is under heavy exploitation pressure in India. Plant tissue culture techniques offer alternative strategies for clonal propagation and camptothecin production to meet demand of the alkaloid along with conservation of the species. Several strategies are employed to enhance in vitro response through seed germination, culture medium optimisation for camptothecin production and clonal propagation. Cryopreservation of embryonic axes is an approach employed in short term preservation of the species. Scale up for the production of camptothecin from N. nimmoniana in bioreactor is a future possibility to meet pharmaceutical market demand and mitigate exploitation of natural population. In this article, we reviewed progress made so far on clonal propagation and camptothecin production in N. nimmoniana. We assessed the challenges and status of camptothecin production in N. nimmoniana by application of in vitro techniques.\\'Abstract: \\'Debates on linking livelihoods and conservation through the commercialization of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) continue to hold significance considering the increasing market demand for NTFPs, its high economic value for forest-dependent communities and neoliberal policies that are in place. Kerala, located on the southwest coast of India, flanked by the Western UN declared biodiversity hot spot, on its windward side, is of particular significance due to the presence of the Ayurvedic traditional medicine industry that procures of its raw materials from the wild. In addition, the presence of a resource-dependent tribal population re-affirms the economic, social and cultural significance of NTFPs. Unsustainable practices and poor co-management and marketing arrangements have rendered the sector ineffective in terms of meeting livelihood as well as conservation goals in the region. Although new approaches such as NTFP certification are being recommended for India not much has been reported on its feasibility and/or implementation challenges. Focusing on the Kadar community of Kerala, this study attempts to highlight some of the issues within the sector and using an present the benefits accrued from new strategies such as NTFP certification through quantitative and qualitative assessments. Last but not least, recommendations for the adoption of sustainable strategies in context with the existing policy environment are provided that may be broadly applicable to other forest-dependent communities in India and elsewhere.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'The present work aimed to evaluate the riparian species diversity of five subwatersheds of the Meenachil river basin and to compare that with the main river channel. A total of 441 species were recorded belonging to 106 families. The Leguminosae was represented by the highest number of species (39 spp.) followed by Poaceae (25 spp.). The quantitative features such as density and importance value index of species varied greatly. In the present study, the diversity index of shrubs and herbs was found to be higher than the tree species. The concentration of dominance was recorded highest in the tree species. index ranged from 1.0 to 2.95. The species richness index varied from 2.43 to 6.69, equitability or evenness index varied from 0.62 to 1.42, the species heterogeneity index varied from 0.4 to 0.83, and Mc Intosh diversity index varied from 56.57 to 329.27. A greater number of tree species fell in girth at breast height, but less number of tree individuals is represented in above 100-cm diameter class.\\'Abstract: \\'Cloud forests in central Guatemala are fragmented and decreasing in area due to slash-and-burn agricultural activities. We studied bird species composition, abundance, guild composition, and site tenacity of a plot located in a cloud forest region of the Sierra Yalijux in Guatemala, half of which was primary forest and half young secondary forest (<7-years-old). Of the 100 species present 14 were restricted to the Endemic Bird Area Central American (i.e. 66% of a total of 21 endemics). Five of the 100 analysed species, including one of the restricted-range species (Troglodytes rufociliatus), had a significantly different abundance in primary and secondary forests. Theoretical analysis suggests that seven species out of a community comprised of 141 bird species are already extirpated and only three out of the 14 present restricted-range species might survive the current state of deforestation. Insectivores were the dominant guild on the plot in terms of numbers of species, followed by omnivores, frugivores and granivores. However, in terms of individuals, omnivores made up nearly half of the bird individuals in primary forest, but declined by 44% in secondary forest, whereas granivores more than doubled in this habitat type. Numbers of species per guild were not significantly different between habitats, while numbers of individuals per guild were significantly different. In general, individuals per species are significantly different in the two habitats. Results suggest that most of the species that are currently surviving in the remnant forests of the Sierra Yalijux might be fairly well adapted to a range of forest conditions, but that populations of a number of restricted-range species might be small. Even generalists species like the Common Bush Tanager (Chlorospingus ophthalmicus) are less abundant in secondary vegetation than in primary forest of the study plot.\\'Abstract: \\'White-eyes (Zosterops spp.) are a group of small passerines distributed across the Eastern Hemisphere that have become a textbook example of rapid speciation. However, traditional taxonomy has relied heavily on conservative plumage features to delimit white-eye species boundaries, resulting in several recent demonstrations of misclassification. Resolution of confused taxonomy is important in order to correctly delimit species and identify taxa which may require conservation, particularly in Asia where the songbird trade is decimating wild populations. In this study, we aim to untangle multiple instances of confused taxonomic treatment in three large, widespread Asian wastebasket species complexes of white-eye (Oriental White-eye Zosterops palpebrosus, Japanese White-eye Zosterops japonicus and Mountain White-eye Zosterops montanus) renowned for their conservative morphology. Using mitochondrial DNA from 173 individuals spanning 42 taxa, we uncovered extensive polyphyly in Z. palpebrosus and Z. japonicus and propose some radically revised species limits under which former members of Z. palpebrosus and Z. japonicus would be reassigned into four and two different species, respectively. The revised taxonomy results in a net loss of two previously recognized species and a net gain of two newly recognized species, leading to significant taxonomic change but a lack of additional species-level diversity. One of the newly elevated species, Zosterops melanurus from Java and Bali, is also the most heavily traded songbird and requires urgent conservation attention.\\'Abstract: \\'Fungal endophytes inhabit living tissues of plants without any apparent symptoms and in many cases are known to produce secondary metabolites similar to those produced by their respective host plants. However on sub-culture, the endophytic fungi gradually attenuate their ability to produce the metabolites. Attenuation has been a major constraint in realizing the potential of endophytic fungi as an alternative source of plant secondary metabolites. In this study, we report attempts to restore camptothecine (CPT) production in attenuated endophytic fungi isolated from CPT producing plants, Nothapodytes nimmoniana and Miquelia dentata when they are passed through their host plant or plants that produce CPT and when treated with a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor. Attenuated endophytic fungi that traversed through their host tissue or plants capable of synthesizing CPT, produced significantly higher CPT compared to the attenuated fungi. Attenuated fungus cultured in the presence of 5-azacytidine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, had an enhanced CPT content compared to untreated attenuated fungus. These results indicate that the attenuation of CPT production in endophytic fungi could in principle be reversed by eliciting some signals from plant tissue, most likely that which prevents the methylation or silencing of the genes responsible for CPT biosynthesis.\\'Abstract: \\'Ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) rhizome has great demand in food and pharmaceutical industry. Odisha is the second largest  ginger-cultivating state, and considered as best suitable after Kerala, in India. Forty-eight germplasm from 10 agro-climatic zones of Odisha were genetically characterized and potential duplicates were identified employing 25 polymorphic markers (RAPD, ISSR, SSR). These markers together amplified 170 polymorphic, 136 monomorphic, and 2 unique bands. SSR markers were the most efficient in generating highest primer resolving power (44.85), primer index (10.28), and number of polymorphic bands (67). interaction was clearly demonstrated from UPGMA dendrogram based similarity coefficients and SAHN clustering which divided 48 samples into 8 sub-clusters (showing congruence with their places of geographical origin). H (0.211), I (0.38), and Gst (0.239) indices revealed genetic diversity within and genetic differentiation among 10 populations. AMOVA showed higher genetic variability among populations than within populations Ginger accessions having a mean genetic distance less than 0.21 (threshold average genetic distance) were considered redundant. Forty-eight samples could be reduced to 11 genetically diverse groups (each group contains duplicates but is different from each other) which confirmed of the collection to be redundant. Identification of duplicates can be useful to eliminate confusion regarding synonyms among farmers, help selection of suitable ginger seed material, and facilitate judicious management of germplasm in conservatory. Genetic diversity analysis unraveled the scope of genetic improvement and breeding program. Clustering analysis showed grouping of majority of samples to respective agro-climatic zones and established the possible interaction between genotype and environment.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'The East coast of India is subject to continuous changes by high energy events. We sought to assess the depositional conditions along the coast from the geophysical and sedimentological character of the dune sands of the Gopalpur and Paradeep coast of Odisha, and the Sagarnagar coast of North Visakhapatnam. Quartz layers of the heavy mineral-rich zone collected at a depth of from the landward foot of the dunes in the Visakhapatnam and Odisha coast, gave the OSL age estimates as and respectively, revealing that the age of the dunes in Visakhapatnam are older than those on the Odisha coast. Episodic high energy events have affected the coast. Evidence from ground penetrating radar data consists of three stratigraphic units. The upper unit consists of vague reflections, parallel to the ground in continuous manner, most probably formed by wind action. On the other hand, the middle layer shows high amplitude reflections of heavy mineral-rich massive layers, possibly the result of tsunami activity. The lower massive layer parallel to the ground surface shows a low reflection pattern. The GPR studies showed that the thickness of the heavy mineral layers is greater on the landward foot of the dune as compared to that on the seaward side. According to the grain size analysis, the dune is composed of both wind generated and tsunamigenic sediments. The scanning electron microscope studies revealed that the heavy minerals present in the dunes are mainly sillimanite, ilmenite, garnet, pyroxene, rutile, sphene, biotite, hornblende, zircon, monazite and magnetite. The study demonstrates the origin of sand dunes in different ages along the East Coast of India by the effect of various natural phenomena.\\'Abstract: \\'In the last years, India has taken a number of initiatives to boost small hydropower development based on the assumption of being a green energy source with only limited disturbances on the social and natural environments. However, its real environmental performances have not been examined. The intention of this paper is to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of Small Hydropower Plants (SHPs) in India in light of their exemption from any Environmental Clearance procedures.\\'Abstract: \\'Rainfall intensities measured at a few stations in Kerala during using a disdrometer were found to be in reasonable agreement with the total rainfall measured using a manual rain gauge. The temporal distributions of rainfall intensity at different places and during different months show that rainfall is of low intensity (< 10 mm/hr), 65% to 90% of the time. This could be an indication of the relative prevalence of stratiform and cumuliform clouds. Rainfall was of intensity < 5 mm/hr for more than 95% of the time in Kochi in July 2002, which was a month seriously deficient in rainfall, indicating that the deficiency was probably due to the relative absence of cumuliform clouds. Cumulative distribution graphs are also plotted and fitted with the Weibull distribution. The fit parameters do not appear to have any consistent pattern. The higher intensities also contributed significantly to total rainfall most of the time, except in Munnar (a hill station). In this analysis also, the rainfall in Kochi in July 2002 was found to have less presence of high intensities. This supports the hypothesis that the rainfall deficiency was probably caused by the absence of conditions that favoured the formation of cumuliform clouds.\\'Abstract: \\'On the 23rd of February, some 50 Conservation Geneticists from around the global gathered for a half day symposium entitled Genetics in the held at the Friedrich-Alexander University, Erlangen, Germany as part of the German Tropical Ecology Society annual meeting 2012. The overall aim of this symposium was to showcase the latest novel research applying molecular methods (landscape genetics, conservation genetics and phylogeography) to advance our understanding of genetic consequences of fragmentation in the tropics, particularly in the context of how population size and isolation influences population and species extinction. I provide a brief overview of the symposium and finish with a call for papers for a special issue of the sister journal Conservation Genetics, for which submission is now open.\\'Abstract: \\'Tropical regions are experiencing unprecedented economic and population growth. This goes hand in hand with increase habitat fragmentation of tropical ecosystems. Understanding the genetic consequences of these spatial and temporal changes across landscapes is critical to conservation of the vast majority of global biodiversity. This virtual issue of Conservation Genetics, presents six empirical and one review paper showcasing fascinating and important findings with regard to how habitat fragmentation impacts on genetic diversity in rare or endangered tropical species. The message from these papers is clear, fragmentation has a number of serious genetic consequences, which can contribute to undermining the viability of species in fragmented landscapes. Conservation genetics provides a powerful tool to inform both conservation and management of species and genetic resources. But, careful consideration is needed to ensure studies apply appropriate sampling designs and genetic analysis to better test hypothesis. Next generation genomics offers great opportunities to provide even more answers and greater resolution of the consequences for adaptive genetic variation, to ensure future tropical landscapes are resilient.\\'Abstract: \\'The subterranean parts of many wild plants form an important constituent of traditional diet of the tribal inhabitants of Similipal Biosphere Reserve, Odisha especially in times of food scarcity during critical periods. However, no specific study has been made so far on this aspect. The present study was conducted during as a search for sources of food and to assess the dietary diversity, consumption pattern, culinary uses and prioritized species of wild tuberous plants sustained by local tribes. The exploration and germplasm collection missions along with intensive botanical survey, focus group discussions, structured household interview and market survey were conducted in 30 villages interacting with 102 key informants of core and buffer zones. A total of 55 wild edible tuberous species representing 37 genera and 24 families were inventoried including 17 species used during food deficiency to meet seasonal shortages. The analyzed data contributed 5 use categories, 4 preparation methods, 7 kinds of food items, 10 species as children snacks, 35 species of pharma-foods and 20 prioritized species. Ten species were domesticated by tribes thus reducing threats on wild tubers and 20 species were traded in local markets to generate additional income exemplifying economic benefits from wild tubers. Seventeen species were identified as novel uses of food items from India. The findings suggested that the nutritional profile along with pharmaceutical attributes of preferred wild food plants be analyzed for recommending suitable species for better nutrition and development of nutraceuticals. Further, many genetic resources of these wild tuberous species of agri-horticultural importance constitute the wild genepool hence their economic and breeding potential along with desirable attributes need to be investigated for utilization in crop improvement programmes.\\'Abstract: \\'The genetic diversity of eight species of Piper (Piperaceae) viz., P. nigrum, P. longum, P. betle, P. chaba, P. argyrophyllum, P. trichostachyon, P. galeatum, and P. hymenophyllum from Kerala state, India were analyzed by Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Out of 22 10-mer RAPD primers screened, 11 were selected for comparative analysis of different species of Piper. High genetic variations were found among different Piper species studied. Among the total of 149 RAPD fragments amplified, 12 bands (8.05%) were found monomorphic in eight species. The remaining 137 fragments were found polymorphic (91.95%). Species-specific bands were found in all eight species studied. The average gene diversity or heterozygosity (H) was 0.33 across all the species, genetic distances ranged from 0.21 to 0.69. The results of this study will facilitate germplasm identification, management, and conservation.\\'Abstract: \\' Small mammals were studied in insular montane forest patches in the Upper Nilgiris in southern India from February 1994 to September 1996. Nine patches were selected at two sites, one with a single large 600-ha patch, the other with several small patches ranging in size from 0.2 to 60 ha. The population characteristics and community structure of small mammals were studied in relation to patch size and habitat structure within the patches. The two most abundant species were Rattus rattus individuals/ha) and Suncus montanus  individuals/ha), while the abundance of seven other species recorded were very low. The population characteristics of R. rattus examined were density, biomass, proportions of juveniles, sub-adults and adults, mean weight of all animals, mean weight of adults, sex ratio and persistence. The proportion of adults, sub-adults, mean weight of animals, and mean weight of adult males were correlated with patch size. Persistence of sub-adult females in the large patch was especially high. The density and biomass of other small-mammal species were also studied. Two indices of diversity, species richness and proportion of were compared as measures of community structure. Seven habitat characteristics were measured; of these, canopy cover, canopy height and tree density were correlated with the size of the patch. Density and biomass of species other than R. rattus and proportion of R. rattus were correlated with canopy height. Density and biomass of species other than R. rattus were highest in smaller patches. While the population characteristics of R. rattus may be affected by patch size, the density of rare species may be influenced by factors related to lower canopy height. Migration between patches may be an important factor in maintaining populations in these patches.\\'Abstract: \\'Most of the mountainous regions in tropical humid climatic zone experience severe soil loss due to natural factors. In the absence of measured data, modeling techniques play a crucial role for quantitative estimation of soil loss in such regions. The objective of this research work is to estimate soil loss and prioritize the sub-watersheds of Kali River basin using Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. Various thematic layers of RUSLE factors such as rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), topographic factor (LS), crop management factor (C), and support practice factor (P) have been prepared by using multiple spatial and non-spatial data sets. These layers are integrated in geographic information system (GIS) environment and estimated the soil loss. The results show that of the study area falls under low erosion risk and only area suffer from very high erosion risk. Based on the rate of soil loss, 165 sub-watersheds have been prioritized into four high, high, moderate, and low erosion risk. Anthropogenic activities such as deforestation, construction of dams, and rapid urbanization are the main reasons for high rate of soil loss in the study area. The soil erosion rate and prioritization maps help in implementation of a proper watershed management plan for the river basin.\\'Abstract: \\'The present study describes the floristic composition and dominance pattern of sal forests in Ranchi, Jharkhand, eastern India. Vegetation was studied in 47 belt that had 137 plant species (110 identified and 27 unidentified) belonging to 51 families. The family Fabaceae with 17 species (8 spp. belonging to subfamily Faboideae, 6 spp. to Caesalpinioideae and 3 spp. to Mimosoidieae) contributed the most to diversity, followed by Rubiaceae (8 spp.) and Euphorbiaceae (6 spp.). Tree density in sal was inversely related to species richness. Total tree density GBH) in the studied forests was 397 individuals with a basal cover of Important plants of conservation concern are Pterocarpus marsupium Roxb, Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Wall, Sterculiaurens cordifolia (Willd.) Miers, and Asparagus densiflorus (Kunth) Jessop. Phanerophytes had the highest percentage (71%, with percentage deviation from normal life form of followed by therophyte (15%, with percentage deviation Observed percentage deviation from normal life form was much lower (with percentage deviation) in both chamaephytes (8%) and therophytes (15%), suggesting that the studied sal forests are favorable for supporting various plants species. The forest management strategies should focus on the increasing demands for different timber and non-timber forest products to conserve the plant diversity of these natural forests.\\'Abstract: \\'Detailed information on the ground-dwelling ant diversity and distribution in the rainforests of the Congo Basin is lacking so far. A new ant species list from a continuous mixed secondary lowland rainforest on the northern periphery of the Dja Biosphere Reserve in southeast Cameroon is presented. We investigated the effect of vegetation type on ant species density, activity and composition. Ants were collected by pitfall trapping in seven vegetation types in each of three seasons during 12 months in 2003 and Our site in Cameroon had a total observed ant diversity of 145 species. Vegetation type significantly influenced the ground-dwelling and -foraging (arboreal) ant assemblages. Differences in species density, activity and composition between vegetation types were explained not only by soil type (hydromorphous terra firme), but also by developmental stage of vegetation types. The highly inundated Raphia-swamp had the lowest ant species density and activity. Older secondary forests still had a different species composition than near primary forest even after 25 years of recovery after anthropogenic disturbance. Finally, the high ant species number captured by our pitfalls, the absence of the invasive exotic ant Wasmannia auropunctata and the high Dorylus (Anomma) army ant diversity confirm the importance of the Cameroonian rainforest for biodiversity conservation programs.\\'Abstract: \\'The various ways in which the forest cover may influence the atmospheric and soil processes controlling the hydrological cycle are examined. Case studies of extensive deforestation affecting the rainfall pattern are reviewed.\\'Abstract: \\'Serious attempts have been made to manage the highly populated Indian coast during the last in terms of regulating the activities and managing disasters. This has lead to formulation of various policies to maintain environmental quality and sustainably manage the coastal resources. Basically, the coastal zone needs to address the demands of all the stakeholders starting from traditional local communities, administrators, to academic researchers etc. India has faced tremendous challenges in implementing regulatory measures like Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) issued in 1991 by demarcating countries coast in to four different zones with provisions and prohibitions for various activities. The concept of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) has been taken with the support of spatial decision-support tools derived from satellite data including national programmes on inter-sectoral approaches towards ICZM. 2004 onwards a series of disasters have reminded the necessity of having regulatory measures through implementable approaches. Subsequently, the CRZ 2011 notification has been a new addition to the list of policies using bottom-up approach as a good governance tool. The country has strengthened its potential in coastal management, disaster management and several community based field projects to enhance participation of stakeholders. This paper is aimed to critically review the processes that are made during the last two decades including the future challenges towards sustainable management of coastal zone with special emphasis on the three coastal areas from eastern, western and southern coast of India.\\'Abstract: \\'The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) lies at the heart of biodiversity conservation initiatives. It offers opportunities to address global issues at the national level through locally grown solutions and measures. This article reviews the national challenges and opportunities in meeting requirements of the CBD by analysing twenty Third National Reports (TNRs), covering five different CBD regional clusters from the three global economic groups. While there is a plethora of challenges, the predominant ones discussed in this study include: institutional and capacity, knowledge and accessible information, economic policy and financial resources, cooperation and stakeholder involvement, and mainstreaming and integration of biodiversity. The underlying problem is that limited capacity in developing countries and transition economies undermines conservation initiatives. Lack of capacity in science, coordination, administration, legislation, and monitoring are barriers to on-ground implementation of biodiversity programmes. Opportunities to overcome these challenges embrace use of knowledge products, information-sharing mechanisms, participatory platforms, educational programmes, multi-level governance, and policy coherence. Innovative market-based instruments are also being trialled in various countries, which seek to offer incentives to local communities. The article concludes that conservation measures should be supported by multiple sectors and secure high level political support. Political, economical, and legislative sectors are more likely to show interest in CBD implementation and use it as a tool for managing biodiversity when they know the Convention processes and perceive it as a benefit. Modest investments in capacity building and training, and engaging different sectors in setting priorities would have a significant pay-off.\\'Abstract: \\'High densities of people living around protected areas (PAs) in South Asia require management strategies to balance conservation goals and livelihood needs. Based on a survey of 777 households around five PAs in India and Nepal, this paper provides a comparative perspective of Indian and Nepali views of protected area benefits and costs, their attitude toward conservation in general, and attitude toward protected area staff. Results indicate mixed responses towards tourism, varying from very favorable in Nepal to less favorable in India. The majority (81%) held positive attitudes towards the existence and importance of PAs but had negative perceptions of PA staff (69%). Most residents perceived benefits from access to fuel wood, fodder and other PA resources including benefits from tourism, while crop and livestock losses from wildlife were the main costs. Households overall positive attitudes towards the PAs and conservation despite high losses from living around PAs suggests that local residents may support conservation if their livelihood needs are met. Comparisons of household attitudes and perceptions suggest that locally based strategies rather than top-down approaches are likely to be more effective. Extending PA benefits to smaller landholders, households that are highly resource-dependent or experiencing higher income losses from human-wildlife conflicts, and less educated residents are particularly important to balance costs and losses from living around protected areas.\\'Abstract: \\'Ecotourism is increasingly being promoted as an instrument that helps local socio-economic development and generate revenues to strengthen conservation of critically endangered biodiversity. It is often posited the magic bullet particularly across protected areas in the Global South. In theory, ecotourism can provide economic benefits to economically weaker communities living around protected areas and inspire them to protect the biodiversity in their own interest. This paper, however, provides empirical evidence that the so-called is not an unqualified truism. With a case study on Sundarban Biosphere Reserve, largest mangrove biodiversity and home of highly endangered Royal Bengal Tiger, this article examines complexities involved in ecotourism and urges the need to make it context-specific. It assesses ability to provide livelihood alternatives to local communities and how can it help in conservation. The findings demonstrate an unequal, uneven, and skewed accumulation of benefits of ecotourism, often associated with market mechanisms of global environmental protection. As little as 36% of the interviewees claimed receiving direct or indirect benefits from ecotourism, the study finds. It failed to offer any benefits at all to the poorest and most marginal communities. On the contrary, it offered disproportionately larger returns to the remotely located capital invested in the local ecotourism facilities in the Sundarbans, thus defeating the principle behind the mechanism. In the area of conservation, tourism was blamed for increasing pollution and harming the health of the ecosystem by tourists who were considered and insensitive to the ecology by the locals and conservation agencies alike.\\'tissue culture plants \\'Abstract: \\' Nothapodytes nimmoniana Graham is an important medicinal tree species occurring in the Western Ghats, a mega diversity hotspot in Southern India. The inner stem bark of the tree contains an important anti-cancer alkaloid, camptothecine (CTP), for which the natural population of the trees is heavily extracted. In this paper, we report the development of a rapid, high frequency regeneration protocol from leaf and nodal explants of N. nimmoniana. Multiple shoot induction was carried out using leaf and nodal explants on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different concentration/combination of phyto-hormones. N6-benzyladenine (BA) was the most effective cytokinin for the induction of multiple shoots. The MS medium with BA yielded the highest number of shoots from leaf and nodal explants, respectively. Further, proliferation and elongation of adventitious buds were observed in secondary medium containing MS supplemented with BA and gibberellic acid (GA3). Shoots were rooted on half strength MS medium containing indole-3-butyric acid. The plantlets were acclimatized in a growth chamber at relative humidity, with light/dark photoperiod. Regenerated plants were free of any noticeable phenotypic variability and showed a survival rate of The in vitro regenerated plants accumulated substantial amount of camptothecine (ranging from 0.08 to These results suggest the possibility of using in vitro regenerated plants as a possible alternative source of CPT. This is the first report of direct regeneration in N. nimmoniana with significantly high plant regeneration frequency and with high CPT yield.\\'Abstract: \\'The Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP) of India, as a whole, faces a severe shortage of water despite receiving a high annual rainfall, this is primarily due to excess runoff and lack of water conservation practices. In this study, an attempt is made to identify zones favourable for the application and adaptation of site-specific artificial-recharge techniques for augmentation of groundwater through a Geographical Information System (GIS) based hydrogeomorphic approach in the Bhatsa and Kalu river basins of Thane district, in western DVP. The criteria adopted for the GIS analysis were based on the hydrogeomorphological characteristics of both basins extracted from the IRS-1C LISS-III data supported by information on drainage pattern, DEM derived slope, lineament density, drainage density, and groundwater condition. The integrated study helps design a suitable groundwater management plan for a basaltic terrain.\\'Abstract: \\'Larvae of almost all of the 5,680 species of the insect order Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) are dependent on freshwater habitats. Both larvae and adults are predators. The order is relatively well studied, and the actual number of species may be close to 7,000. Many species have small distributional ranges, and are habitat specialists, including inhabitants of alpine mountain bogs, seepage areas in tropical rain forests, and waterfalls. They are often successfully used as indicators for environmental health and conservation management. The highest diversity is found in flowing waters in rain forests of the tropics, the Oriental and Neotropical regions being the most speciose. This paper discusses diversity, summarises the biogeography of dragonflies in the different biogeographical regions and gives the total number of species and genera per family per biogeographical region. Examples are given of areas of particular diversity, in terms of areas of endemism, presence of ancient lineages or remarkable recent radiations but no well-based review of areas with high endemism of dragonflies is available so far. The conservation status of dragonflies is briefly discussed. Species confined to small remnants of forest in the tropics are most under threat of extinction by human activities.\\'Abstract: \\'Grain legumes contribute significantly to total world food production. Legumes are the primary source of dietary proteins in many developing countries, where protein hunger and malnutrition are widespread. Grain legumes germplasm constitute ~15% of the accessions preserved globally. Nearly, 78% of the accessions, have been characterized, compared to 34% of national genebank collections. Interestingly, limited data on grain quality are available as the primary focus has been on morpho-agronomic traits. Clearly, more resources should be targeted on biochemical evaluation to identify nutritionally rich and genetically diverse germplasm. The formation of core and mini core collections has provided crop breeders with a systematic yet manageable entry point into global germplasm resources. These subsets have been reported for most legumes and have proved useful in identifying new sources of variation. They may however not eliminate the need to evaluate entire collections, particularly for very rare traits. Molecular characterization and association mapping will further aid to insights into the structure of legume diversity and facilitate greater use of collections. The use of high resolution elevational climate models has greatly improved our capacity to characterize plant habitats and adaptive responses to stresses. Evidence suggests that there has been increased use of wild relatives as well as new resources resulting from mutagenesis to enhance the genetic base of legume cultigens.\\'Abstract: \\'Participation is the initiation and continuance of an active process by which beneficiary groups influence the direction and execution of development activity. In the context of resource management participatory institutions often present an alternative when the market and/or the state fail to maintain resource stocks at desirable levels. This paper presents two case-studies of the emergence of participatory institutions and builds up analytical models that explain the process of their evolution in an inter-temporal framework.\\'Abstract: \\'The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) ATPase 8/6 gene has been used in phylogenetic as well as in phylogeographic studies along with other mtDNA markers. In this study, ATPase gene sequences were used to assess the genetic structuring and phylogeographic patterns in Channa striata. Out of 884 nucleotide positions generated in ATPase 8/6 genes, 76 were polymorphic. The study suggested 23 unique haplotypes from 67 individuals of nine populations collected from different riverine systems of India. The ATPase 8/6 sequence revealed highest haplotype as well as nucleotide diversities in Imphal River population and lowest diversities in Tapti River population. The pattern of genetic diversity and haplotype network indicated distinct mitochondrial lineages for Chaliyar population, whereas mismatch distribution strongly suggested a population expansion in mid pleistocene epoch (0.4 Mya) with distinct genetic structuring in C. striata. The baseline information on genetic variation and the population sub-structuring would facilitate conservation and management of this important snakehead murrel.\\'South India\\'Abstract: \\'Eleven accessions of an under-utilized legume, Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC. var. utilis (Wall. ex Wight) Baker ex Burck (velvet bean) were collected from four districts of South India and their agronomic characters were evaluated. The vegetative growth characters such as the germination percentage, plant height, number of leaves and branches per plant were recorded. The yield based characters such as the number of clusters/plant number of flowers/cluster and the fertility index were observed. The seed yield reaches The number of seeds per pod, seed weight and the seed recovery percentage were also calculated. The level of diversity in the agrobotanical traits of velvet bean observed in the present study could be of interest in a breeding programme.\\'Abstract: \\'An attempt has been made to diagnose the orographic rainfall associated with internal gravity waves excited by the hills (ABH) in India, during south west monsoon season (SWMS). To develop this model ABH has been synthesised by two 3-D elliptical barriers, separated by a valley of some finite distance. In this paper, a three dimensional frictionless, laminar, adiabatic, boussinesq, non-rotating and inviscid moist airflow with realistic vertical variation of wind and temperature, has been considered. Here also the basic flow consists of two components such as zonal wind component U(z) and meridional wind component V(z). The perturbation technique is used to linearise the governing equations of the airflow and to obtain perturbation vertical velocity the quasi-numerical approach have been used. The perturbation vertical velocity is used to compute the rainfall intensity (RFI) over ABH during SWMS. Also, we examine the sensitivity of the computed RFI on the length (d) of the valley. Finally, the computed results have compared with Gridded Rainfall Data set, generated by India meteorological Department (IMD), India.\\'Abstract: \\'We examined the effects of forest patch size on woody tree species richness and abundance in tropical montane evergreen forest patches of the Nilgiri region, south India. We sampled woody trees from 21 forest patches in the upper Nilgiri hills elevation) and recorded a total of 35,146 individuals of 61 species, 45 genera and 30 families. Species richness and abundance of sapling/shrubs to increased significantly with increasing patch size, but the species richness and abundance of small, medium and larger trees to to and dbh, respectively) did not. Overall, forest interior species richness and abundance increased significantly with increasing patch size but edge species richness did not. Species richness and abundance of shade-tolerant and shade-demanding tree species also increased with increasing patch size. The abundance of zoochory dispersed tree species was significantly related to increasing patch size, but those dispersed by autochory did not display any clear relationship between patch size and species richness or abundance. Our findings suggest that with increasing forest patch area, tree compositional patterns may be driven by species specific shade-tolerance adaptations and dispersal patterns. Differential responses in these traits by the plant community within the individual habitat zones of forest edge and interiors likely plays a major role in determining the inherent plant community and thus the subsequent ecological processes of forest patches, including their responses to increasing patch area.\\'pressures\\'Abstract: \\'We examined the response of forest tree species with different dispersal modes to anthropogenic pressure in a dry deciduous forest of South India. The species and their populations were sampled in two forest stands, one in proximity to a Soliga settlement (greater disturbance) and the other distant to the settlement (lower disturbance). Our results suggest that the populations of animal dispersed species than those of wind or passively dispersed species are more vulnerable to human disturbance. In fact wind dispersed species seem to be facilitated by human disturbances. The proximal site had a higher representation of understory plants and seedling belonging to wind dispersed species than that of animal dispersed species. We discuss the results in the context of the role of dispersal mode in shaping species response, and vegetation composition of forest to anthropogenic pressures.\\'Abstract: \\'The increasing in drug/antibiotics resistance by microorganisms finds the search for the new drugs with better results. Coscinium fenestratum considered as a critically endangered medicinal plant belongs to the family Menispermaceae. It is commonly found in Western Ghats of India and Sri Lanka.

The morphometric parameters of the sub-watersheds are classified under linear, aerial and relief aspects. Morphometric analysis has been carried out using GIS software-ERDAS Imagine (V 8.7) and Arc GIS (V 9.0). Drainage network in the study area shows dendritic pattern. Dendritic pattern, in general is considered as a group of resequent streams within homogenous lithology and gently sloping topography. Stream orders range from first to sixth order. Results obtained from the morphometric analysis show that all sub-watersheds have very coarse to coarse drainage texture and fall under normal basin category, while the elongation ratio (Re) shows that Chandni sub-watershed is circular in shape and the remaining sub-watersheds are elongated.\\'Abstract: \\'Climate change is one of the most important global environmental challenges, which affects the entire earth system in terms of negative impacts on food production, water supply, health, livelihood, energy, etc. The intent of the present study was to assess the impact of climate change on the water balance components of a data-starved Upper Baitarani River basin of Eastern India using ArcSWAT model. The ArcSWAT model was calibrated using SUFI-2 technique. The daily observed streamflow data from 1998 to 2003 were employed for calibration and those for for validation. The calibration results were found to be satisfactory with the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.88 and for the daily time step, respectively. Also, the model was validated successfully for simulating daily streamflow and The calibrated and validated model was then used to evaluate basin response to the anticipated climate changes by the end of the 21st century. Twelve independent as well as twenty eight combined area-specific climatic scenarios were considered in this study to evaluate the impact of climate change on the hydrology of the basin. The analysis of model results for the 12 Independent Climatic Scenarios indicated a reduction in the surface runoff ranging from 2.5 to by changing the temperature from 1 to whereas the increase in rainfall by 2.5 to suggested an increase in surface runoff by 6.67 to from the baseline condition. In case of 28 Combined Scenarios compared to the baseline condition, the changes in surface runoff would vary from to the groundwater recharge would change from to and the evapotranspiration would increase from 4.05 to It is concluded that future changes in the climatic condition by the end of the 21st century are most likely to produce significant impacts on the streamflow in the study area. The findings of this study and those of follow-up studies in this direction will be useful for guiding suitable adaptation measures for sustainable water management in the basin in the face of impending climate change.\\'India\\'Abstract: \\'The genetic variation of local subpopulations (Palni hills, India) of the blackfly Simulium gravelyi was surveyed at different altitudinal locations using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. By comparing the similarity of the bands produced by RAPDs, it may be concluded that there is variation within this population. These data suggest that the heterogeneity of band pattern of S. gravelyi steadily increased from low elevation to high elevation. Site 5 (1590 m altitude) was more polymorphic and it differed most from site 1 (290 m). This is established by the ecological diversity and statistical analyses (PCA) and predicting two major ecological factors of conductivity and current velocity. The speciation hypothesis is consistent with the molecular evidence, postulates a high elevational site 5 (1590 m) and a subsequent site 4 (1250 m).\\'Abstract: \\' Swertia is ethno-medicinally an important genus belonging to family Gentianaceae. Swertia chirayita is used as imperative medicinal plant in Indian system of medicine. However, this species has been frequently adulterated due to its high demand and scarcity. Authentication of this species was needed to protect consumers and conservation measures and to find out the alternative source. Deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) extracted from fifteen samples of six species belonging to different localities, were used as templates. Four candidate barcodes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis was executed by Z-Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing v.3. Sequenced products were analyzed on automated applied biosystems 3730XI analyzer. Identification was performed by using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis 5 software (version 5.1). The amplification efficiency of all DNA barcodes [megakaryocyte-associated tyrosine kinase (matK), ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL), photosystem II protein D1- stuctural RNA- His tRNA (psbA-trnH) and internal transcribed spacer region (ITS)] was Here, the highest interspecific divergence provided by ITS is and intraspecific by psbA-trnH being as compared to matK and rbcL ITS region proves robust molecular marker for differing the S. chirayita from its related adulterant species. All barcoding regions indicate that S. chirayita and S. minor both are more closely related than other Swertia species. Findings showed that DNA barcoding is an efficient tool for identification and authentication of S. chirayita. Use of S. minor as substitute to S. chirayita can be advocated.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Ecotourism potentially provides a sustainable approach to tourism development in national parks. The paper focuses on ecotourism impacts and the status of wildlife within the Rajiv Gandhi National Park (Nagarhole) situated in Karnataka. It explores a multitude of interactions that exist among wildlife, conservation efforts, socio-economic, and relocation attempts of the tribal people in the park. Field exploration was undertaken to identify the impacts of ecotourism. The results revealed the ongoing effort by the government to relocate the tribal people within the park and the difficulty faced by park officials to cope with the numerous impacts and conservation strategies in the park. The tourists were engaged in different ecotourism activities and made an observation on the lack of educational awareness and biophysical impacts such as littering and vegetation damage. This paper will contribute a greater understanding of the impacts of ecotourism management for sustainability of the national park.\\'Abstract: \\'We investigated the phytosociology, structure and dynamics of Pinus roxburghii in 40 stands in northern areas of Pakistan by using cluster analysis agglomerative clustering) and ordination (Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling). Cluster analysis revealed three major groups associated with specific environmental characteristics: (1) P. roxburghii (2) Pinus-Quercus baloot and (3) Pinus-Olea ferruginea community types. NMS-ordination showed the major gradient as an amalgam of elevation (r 2 = 0.441, p <0.01) and slope (r 2 = 0.391, p <0.05) as the two topographic factors correlated with species distribution. The first ordination axis also showed positive correlation with soil variables like pH and electrical conductivity, suggesting that soil chemistry was related to topographic characteristics and probably acted as a secondary gradient. We also examined size class distributions, age structures and growth rates of the three communities in order to describe community development and dynamics. Total tree density was 14700 plants/ha, with P. roxburghii having a relative density of 82% to 100%. Density of juvenile and total density and basal area of the subordinate tree species were low. The low density of trees in the smallest diameter size-class suggested that the recruitment of small P. roxburghii plants into the adult population may be lower than the required replacement rate for the stands. Pooled size-class distributions for the species showed a multimodal pattern with some regeneration gaps. Browsing, heavy logging and other anthropogenic activities were the overriding factors responsible for the poor recruitment of P. roxburghii. We concluded from the age structure that the forests were characterized by the dominance of young trees. Growth rate analysis revealed that P. roxburghii was the fastest growing species among the conifers species in Pakistan. In view of its relatively fast growth and longevity, P. roxburghii seems to be a suitable choice for short-term cultural practices in order to enhance wood production in lesser Himalaya and Hindukush ranges of Pakistan.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Land use/land cover change dynamics along the estuarine complex of in the coastal state of Goa, India is studied by the application of multi-temporal remote sensing data. This tropical estuarine region has faced significant changes in the last few decades due to diverse pressures from various sectors, mainly of anthropogenic origin. Spatial and temporal changes in the LU/LC classes have been evaluated using satellite datasets from Landsat MSS, TM and IRS-LISS III for the years 1973, 1989, 2001 and 2011. Considering a spectrally heterogeneous landscape of the region, the LU/LC changes are identified by using principal component analysis (PCA) as a pre-classification step, followed by the implementation of a combination of supervised and unsupervised classification called hybrid classification. The application of PCA has proved to be suitable to successfully identify discrete land surface classes for this study area. An overall accuracy of and has been obtained for the year 2011, 2001, 1989 and 1973, respectively. The study reveals a gradual increase in built-up area due to urbanization corresponding to a decrease in agricultural land and a considerable loss in beach area. Changes in the mangroves are also assessed within this extent as Goa has significant pockets of mangroves which are located mainly along the estuarine complexes of Mandovi and Zuari (along with the Cumbarjua canal complex). The results highlight an increase in mangrove coverage within the study extent by from 1973 to 2011. The mangrove areal extent along Mandovi has increased from 149.45 to and from 142.95 to along Zuari (including Cumbarjua canal). Increasing awareness and the steps taken by the forest department to provide suitable environment for the growth of mangroves are the main reasons for this increment.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availablekotiya)\\'Abstract: \\'Apex predators fulfil potentially vital ecological roles. Typically wide-ranging and charismatic, they can also be useful surrogates for biodiversity preservation, making their targeted conservation imperative. The Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya), an endangered, endemic sub-species, is the apex predator. Of potential keystone importance, this carnivore also fulfills and criterion and is of high ecological and existence value. Apex predator conservation requires identifying factors underlying distribution, so we used multi-scale maximum entropy modelling with sampling bias correction to investigate a broad suite of relevant ecological, climatic and anthropogenic factors in order to identify potentially suitable leopard habitat. Presence locations were determined from of surveys, observations and verified reports. The best bias correction procedure and scale were uncertain, so we employed a novel method of using information from all models across analyses to determine top models and identify influential variables. Leopard presence was most strongly linked to the landscape proportion encompassed by Protected Areas strictly limiting human presence, with more porous Protected Areas less influential. All three forest composition and configuration metrics investigated (area weighted mean patch size, patch density and forest connectivity) were influential, with increased patch size and higher connectivity predicting better habitat suitability for leopards. Habitat suitability was also better where cropland extent and urban patch size were small. In summary, ground-level protection and natural forest extent and connectivity are of profound importance to Sri Lankan leopard distribution and are key factors in ensuring the ecological integrity of the faunal assemblages.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableIndia\\'Abstract: \\'Tree species richness, tree density, basal area, population structure and distribution pattern were investigated in undisturbed, mildly disturbed, moderately disturbed and highly disturbed stands of tropical wet evergreen forests of Arunachal Pradesh. The forest stands were selected based on the disturbance index (the basal area of the cut trees measured at ground level expressed as a fraction of the total basal area of all trees including felled ones): (i) undisturbed stand (0% disturbance index), (ii) mildly disturbed (20% disturbance index), (iii) moderately disturbed (40% disturbance index), and (iv) highly disturbed stand (70% disturbance index). Tree species richness varied along the disturbance gradient in different stands. The mildly disturbed stand showed the highest species richness (54 of 51 genera). Species richness was lowest (16 of 16 genera) in the highly disturbed stand. In the undisturbed stand, 47 species of 42 genera were recorded while in the moderately disturbed stand 42 species of 36 genera were found. The diversity index for tree species ranged from 0.7 to 2.02 in all the stands. The highest tree diversity was recorded in the undisturbed stand and the lowest in the highly disturbed stand. The stands differed with respect to the tree species composition at the family and generic level. Fagaceae, Dipterocarpaceae and Clusiaceae dominated over other families and contributed 53% in the undisturbed, 51% in the mildly disturbed, 42% in the moderately disturbed and 49% in the highly disturbed forest stands to the total density of the respective stand. Stand density was highest (5452 stems in the undisturbed stand, followed by the mildly disturbed stand (5014), intermediate (3656) in the moderately disturbed stand and lowest (338) in the highly disturbed stand. Dominance, calculated as the importance value index of different species, varied greatly across the stands. The highest stand density and species richness were represented in the medium girth class cm) in all the stands. In the undisturbed stand, the highest density was found in the cm girth class, while in the mildly disturbed stand the cm girth range recorded the highest density. About 55, 68 and 52% species were found to be regenerating in the undisturbed, mildly disturbed and moderately disturbed stands, respectively. No regeneration was recorded in the highly disturbed stand. Variation in species richness, distribution pattern and regeneration potential is related to human interference and the need for forest conservation is emphasized.\\'India\\'Abstract: \\'For sustainable development in a river basin, it is crucial to understand population use/land cover (LU/LC) quality nexus. This study investigates the effects of demographic changes and LU/LC transformations on surface water quality of rural (Ghod) and urban (Mula-Mutha) subbasins of Upper Bhima River basin. Population data and LU/LC data {October 2002 [Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data] and October/November 2009 (Indian Remote Sensing 1C Linear Imaging Self Scanner III data]} were analysed using statistical, remote sensing and geographic information system techniques to study demographic and LU/LC changes, respectively. Further, overall indices of pollution (OIPs) developed specifically for rural subbasin (OIPr: Hardness CaCO3 and Total Dissolved Solids), urban subbasin (OIPu: Biological Oxygen Demand, Chlorides, Coliform Total, Colour, Dissolved Oxygen%, pH and Turbidity) and single OIP considering all parameters (OIPa) were used for spatio-temporal water quality assessment of pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods. Results revealed that from 1981 to 2011, population increase was higher in urban subbasin than in rural subbasin. Subsequently, from 2002 to 2009 mainly increase in built-up lands (3.82%) and agricultural lands (15.35%) in urban and rural subbasins respectively, affected their water quality. From 2002 to 2009, the highest increase in OIPr and OIPu was observed at Kashti due to fertilizers) and Bundgarden Bridge due to municipal and industrial wastes) stations of rural and urban subbasins, respectively. With significant increase in OIPa of Bundgarden Bridge station affected by urbanization had the most polluted water quality.\\'Abstract: \\'The plant resources form an integral part of a huge inter-dependent system that encompasses the physical components and the biological community of life. These resources have enormous prospective benefits to humankind. The ever-increasing population and climate change over the years have contributed substantially to the pressure on plant resources leading to their decline or loss in nature. Hence, there is an immediate need to develop suitable conservation strategies for proper utilization and sustainability of these important resources.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Seasonal variation of ground water in Nayagarh district, Odisha is determined by analysing both pre and post monsoon water samples. The high fluoride content is an endemic problem in the area and special attention was attached to the point. The chemical compositions of the ground water of the area are dominated by CaCl, NaCl and mixed CaMgCl types in pre-monsoon and CaHCO3-mixed CaMgCl type in post-monsoon. This is largely due to chemical weathering of Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt rock types. Increasing alkalinity vis-a-vis F concentration in pre-monsoon is associated with sodium-bicarbonate water types having high pH (>7) and low calcium and magnesium contents. The percentage of total high fluoride containing water samples is nearly double in pre-monsoon than in post-monsoon. During both the seasons, pH values indicate mildly alkaline to weakly acidic nature of the water samples. Fluoride concentration has good correlation with pH in pre-monsoon whereas in post-monsoon it shows good correlation with Fe. Facies analysis indicates that water is becoming predominantly Ca-Na cation and Cl-SO4-HCO3 anion type in premonsoon than Ca-Mg type and HCO3-Cl-SO4 type in post-monsoon. The seasonal variations in concentrations of anthropogenic components demonstrate that the groundwater system is very less liable to pollution by human activities.\\'Abstract: \\'Zygotic embryos excised from immature green fruits of the rattan palm, Calamus thwaitesii and cultured for under optimum culture conditions in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) produced mixed (compact and friable) calli at 70 and rates. The semi-friable part of the callus separated and subcultured in medium containing 6-benzyladenine and acetic acid produced groups of discrete globular embryoids of varied size in Calli raised in presence of 2,4,5-T were relatively more prolific, friable and embryogenic than those induced by 2,4-D. Embryoids isolated and cultured in basal medium germinated into plantlets at efficiency while the immature ones produced calloid structures. Approximately of the in vitro plantlets raised from the 2,4-D-induced embryogenic calli produced secondary immature embryoids on the sheath and lamina parts of leaves which were isolated and cultured in basal medium developed into rooted plantlets at rate in The continued growth of the embryo-derived callus through successive subcultures together with differentiation of embryoids into plantlets, and the formation of immature embryoids on in vitro plantlets in MS basal nutrient medium reports for the first time a reliable method of producing at least 116 plants from a single embryo in a year. Rooted plantlets treated with glycerin survived at rate after hardening and of the hardened plants reintroduced into forest segments showed uniform growth free of morphological abnormalities after of observation. In addition to embryogenesis, cryopreservation of the zygotic embryos through simple drying and methods resulting recovery rates also offers another option for long-term conservation and sustainable utilization of this plant genetic resource.\\'Abstract: \\'Cucumbers (Cucumis sativus) are considered to be native to India.

Future scope for commercial growing and research needs are emphasised.\\'Abstract: \\'India is one of the most flood-prone countries in the world after Bangladesh and these are quite common throughout the country. However, their characteristics differ from region to region. Flooding behavior and their management at national level have been investigated in this article. Floods are caused mainly due to the extreme spatial and temporal variation in the quantity of rainfall and meteorological conditions during monsoon season About 80% of the total annual rainfall is concentrated during the period, resulting in a very high discharge from rivers, causing extensive damage to life and property. The National Flood Control Program has been launched in the country in the year 1954. Since then, sizeable progress has been made in structural and non-structural flood protection measures. Structural measures involve the construction of physical structures like embankments, dams, drainage channels, and reservoirs that prevent flood waters from reaching potential damage centers, whereas non-structural measures like flood forecasting aim at improving the preparedness to floods by keeping people away from flood waters. Institutional and legal setup to mitigate the impacts of floods has evolved over the years. Nevertheless, statistics do not reveal major reduction in the flood damages. However, river-friendly and less-interventionist approaches have been suggested to achieve sustainable flood management.\\'Abstract: \\'In recent years, the use of remotely sensed data and Geographic Information System (GIS) applications has been found increasing in a wide range of resources inventory, mapping, analysis, monitoring and environmental management. Remote sensing data provides an opportunity for better observation and systematic analysis of terrain conditions following the synoptic and multi-spectral coverage. In the present study, the geomorphological analysis reveals that various denudational and depositional landforms have been analysed and mapped. The soil depth ranges from extremely shallow in isolated mounds to very deep in the pediplains. Based on the slope gradient, morphometry, soil depth, vegetation cover and image characteristics of standard FCC imagery of IRS-1D LISS-III data, four categories of eroded lands i.e., very severe, severe, moderate and nil to slight have been identified and mapped. The integrated analysis of slope, geomorphology and degraded lands layers in GIS revealed that the pediplains, rolling plains and subdued plateau are associated with very severe land degradation and accounts for 6.05%, 3.85% and 3.47% of total area respectively. The analysis of percentage of degraded lands at geomorphic sub unit level indicates that severe land degradation process is dominant in the dissected ridges, isolated mounds, escarpments and plateau spurs. The remote sensing data and GIS based detailed geomorphological and degraded lands analysis ensure better understanding of landform-eroded lands relationship and distribution to assess the status of land degradation at micro geomorphic unit for reclamation, geo-environmental planning and management. Similar study also helps in the areas of natural resource management, environmental planning and management, watershed management and hazards monitoring and mitigation.\\'Abstract: \\'This study examines the spatial and temporal forest cover changes in Swat and Shangla districts to understand the deforestation pattern in context of the recent security conflict in these districts. We used multi-resolution satellite images to assess the long term deforestation from 2001 to2009 and also to identify episodic forest cutting areas appeared during the conflict period of Oct. 2008. There are only 58 ha of deforestation identified during the conflict period while 1268 ha of gross annual deforestation were assessed during last eight years. Most of the deforestation patches persist around the administrative boundaries at sub-district levels (tehsils) which can be attributed to ambiguity in unclear jurisdiction between the forest official. The results highlight that the forest cutting appeared in Swat and Shangla during the conflict period is not as significant when compared with the long term deforestation pattern in the area. On the one side the results of the study are supportive to the picture that emerges from international studies which report high rate of deforestation in the country and on the other side it negates any relation between the security situation and the increasing deforestation in the north western Pakistan. The study concludes that deforestation assessments require verification by independent sources of data, such as satellite imagery to improve our understanding of deforestation processes.\\'Abstract: \\'Chilika Lake, the largest brackish water lagoon in Asia, is a prominent biodiversity hotspot along the Indian east coast. The geomorphology, water quality and biological productivity of the lake had undergone significant changes over the years under the influence of natural events and anthropogenic interventions. Decades of research have shown that the ecological changes of the lake system and its fisheries were influenced mainly by the water exchange between the lake and the sea that controls the salinity, siltation, macrophyte infestation and recruitment of marine forms. Depletion of fisheries and loss of biodiversity in 1980s and 1990s have been linked to the northward shifting of inlet and silting up of the outer channel. In order to improve the health of the lagoon and restoration of its biodiversity, a new mouth was dredged open in September 2000. Opening of the new mouth has resulted in some improvements with substantial increase in capture fishery, reduction in weed infestation, growth of seagrasses, appearance of dolphins and increase in the population of migratory birds. But, many stake holders claim that the problems associated with the lake ecology and its contribution to the socio-economic development of the stake holders still persist which could escalate in future.\\'Abstract: \\'Plant diversity plays key ecological roles in forest ecosystems, including influencing succession, resilience and nutrient cycling. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of livestock grazing and human uses on herbaceous species diversity. We surveyed 50 ha of protected area and 50 ha of unprotected area to evaluate herbaceous species diversity in oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) forests in northern Iran. We calculated and compared three indices each of diversity and evenness, and species richness between the two areas. Herbaceous cover was higher in the unprotected area while leaf litter depth and tree canopy cover were higher in the protected area. The diversity indices, H (Shannon-Wiener index), N1 (McArthur index), N2 index), EQ (Modified Nee index), Evar (Smith-Wilson index), E5 (modified index of Hill) and R=S (species richness) and species richness R=S were greater in the protected area than in the unprotected area, suggesting that protection from grazing results in increased numbers of plants and species. The effect of land protection on plant diversity was more pronounced for evenness than for species richness and the positive correlation between diversity and evenness indices was higher than that between diversity and richness.\\'Abstract: \\'Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and their mycorrhizae were studied in winter rainfall areas of western South Africa. The species composition, spore numbers, and mycorrhization were attempted to correlate with various abiotic factors. Mycorrhization of grasses was significantly correlated with pH and spore numbers and negatively correlated with electric conductivity, total N-content, and total P-content of the soils. Spore numbers were negatively correlated with electric conductivity and total N-content.\\'Abstract: \\'Different human societies have different biodiversity around them; there is diversity in their food habits, ailments, occupations, daily routine, social customs, needs, and notions about natural phenomena. They have different domestic animals, and consequently, different veterinary diseases to manage. These circumstances have given rise to very diverse experiences among indigenous societies about plant wealth around them. Over generations, this has made very rich additions to the interrelationships between man and plant wealth around him. Faith, tradition, taboos and several such associations with forests and particular plant species have helped in conservation of plant diversity. The richness of plant diversity in any area, is not evaluated merely by the number of species occurring there, but by the intensity of associations and dependence of the indigenous communities on that plant wealth. Respect for this indigenous knowledge, and relationship helps in conservation.\\'Abstract: \\'It is generally considered difficult to resolve negative unidirectional externalities within hydro-hegemonic basins in which the upstream powerful riparian has the incentive to unilaterally develop the river without regard to downstream consequences. Weaker downstream riparian states can resort to issue linkages and side payments to coerce a change in the upstream behavior, but the success of these tools depends on the specific political and economic situation in the basin and on the preferences of the hydro-hegemonic state for cooperation. Neglected in the literature is another possibility. Through a consideration of the sanctioned discourse of watershed management at the domestic levels, this article shows that domestic environmental non-governmental organizations and policy the application of a range of work to change the domestic water management discourse from a state-hydraulic paradigm to a more sustainable water management paradigm. When these efforts are successful, we can find that these non-state actors can perform a crucial function in cleaning up domestic stretches of international rivers, which produces positive externalities downstream. In the process, they are able of achieving what often years of international negotiations failed to accomplish. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, policies on water quality in the national stretches of Ganges Basin and policies on biodiversity in the national stretches of the Mekong Basin are used to make this argument.\\'Abstract: \\'Surface water samples from Godavari river basin was analyzed quantitatively for the concentration of eight heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, nickel and zinc using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The analyzed data revealed that iron and zinc metals were found to be the most abundant metals in the river Godavari and its tributaries. Iron (Fe) recorded the highest, while cadmium (Cd) had the least concentration. Arsenic, cadmium, chromium, iron and zinc metals are within the acceptable limit of BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) 1050 (2012) Specification for drinking water, pp The analysis of Godavari river and its water samples reveals that the water is contaminated at selected points which are not suitable for drinking. Nickel and Copper concentration is above acceptable limit and other metal concentration is within the acceptable limit. Comprehensive study of the results reveals that out of 18 water quality stations monitored, water samples collected at 7 water quality stations are found to be within the permissible limit for all purposes. While Rajegaon, Tekra, Nandgaon, P. G. Bridge, Bhatpalli, Kumhari, Pauni, Hivra, Ashti, Bamini, and Jagda stations were beyond the desirable limit due to presence of copper and nickel metals. The contents of copper metal ions were higher at some water quality stations on Wunna river (Nandgaon); Wardha river (Hivra) and Wainganga river (Kumhari, Pauni, Ashti) during Feb. 2012, while nickel concentration during Feb. 2012, June 2012, March 2013 and Aug. 2013 at some water quality stations on rivers Bagh, Indravati, Pranhita, Wunna, Penganga, Peddavagu, Wainganga and Wardha. It can be concluded that rapid population growth and industrialization have brought about resource degradation and a decline in environmental quality.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\' Aconitum balfourii (Bruhl) Muk. (Ranunculaceae) is an endangered medicinal plant. Natural populations were surveyed in the northwest Himalaya for population estimation and evaluation of elite germplasm. Vegetation sampling of quadrats was conducted using the vertical belt transect method in areas supporting A. balfourii. Plant density and relative dominance of A. balfourii were low compared with other alpine species. Threat status was determined on a site-by-site basis as well as for entire western Himalaya. A. balfourii was generally classified as endangered on the basis of geographic distribution and critically endangered on the basis of abundance. We found the natural geographic distribution of A. balfourii to be diminishing due to habitat destruction. Immediate corrective management measures are needed for sustainable utilization and long-term conservation of the species in the wild.\\'Abstract: \\'Sympatric species adapt to, and temporally or geographically segregate access to similar limiting factors.\\'Abstract: \\'Non-timber forest products (NTFP) such as fuelwood, fodder, fruit, medicinal plants, and small timber are important to the rural poor in India. The traditional usufruct rights that the poor enjoyed have been gradually eroded by state control. This process has accelerated with increases in the prices of timber and industrial wood products. Non-timber forest products collected by the poor do not enter the system of national accounts, which results in the undervaluation of the forest wealth of the country. According to some estimates, the total demand for these products outstrips the sustainable yield of the forests in India. To ensure the best use of the forests, it is necessary for rural communities to share the responsibility of forest management with the forest departments. A proposed joint forestry project in South India is discussed as a case study of this innovative approach to forest management. Data on the existing patterns of NTFP extraction are presented to gain a better understanding of the role that these products play in the life of the rural poor. Policies from the case study are discussed in the concluding section.\\'Abstract: \\'India is a vast country and is highly diversified in terms of natural resources and socio-economic setup. Moreover, its water resources are unevenly distributed in space and time. With increasing population and increasing aspiration for improved standard of living, there is an acute pressure on the demand and availability of water. Though the idea of interlinking of rivers is not a new concept in India, it had rather persisted long back as much as in other countries of ancient civilization. National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has given the real shape to the proposal of the interlinking of rivers of the country. In India the river-linking project in a sensible and scientific manner will not only allow the prevention of the colossal wastage of a vitally important natural resource, mitigate the flood and inundation by detaining flowing surface water of rainy seasons, but also ensure availability of water to drier areas; combating both flood and drought simultaneously. Moreover, this project will generate of hydropower and irrigation of an additional hectares miles) of land. Though linking of rivers may initially appear to be a costly proposition in ecological, geological, hydrological and economical terms, in the long run the net benefits coming from it will far outweigh these costs or losses. However, in the absence of any definite international legal framework, Bangladesh has raised objections against the project. This paper aims at looking at this long-term plan, the project proposal, its involvement and impact not only on the states of India, India as a whole, but also on its neighbouring nations which are linked with India through the waterways, and share the common climatic conditions and economic status.\\'Abstract: \\'We examine the dynamics and spatial determinants of land change in India by integrating decadal land cover maps from a wall-to-wall analysis of Landsat images with spatiotemporal socioeconomic database for ~630,000 villages in India. We reinforce our results through collective evidence from synthesis of 102 case studies that incorporate field knowledge of the causes of land change in India. We focus on land conversions, and forest area changes (excludes non-forest tree categories including commercial plantations). We show that cropland to fallow conversions are prominently associated with lack of irrigation and capital, male agricultural labor shortage, and fragmentation of land holdings. We find gross forest loss is substantial and increased from to The gross forest gain also increased from to Overall, India experienced a net decline in forest by (gross gain) consistently during both decades. We show that the major source of forest loss was cropland expansion in areas of low cropland productivity (due to soil degradation and lack of irrigation), followed by industrial development and mining/quarrying activities, and excessive economic dependence of villages on forest resources.\\'Abstract: \\'A cascade of reviews and growing body of literature exists on forest invasion ecology, its mechanism or causes; however, no review addressed the sustainable management of invasive plants of forest in totality. Henceforth, the present paper aims to provide a critical review on the management of invasive species particularly in the context of forest plants. Plant invasion in forest is now increasingly being recognized as a global problem, and various continents are adversely affected, although to a differential scale. Quest for the ecological mechanism lying behind the success of invasive species over native species of forest has drawn the attention of researches worldwide particularly in the context of relationship. Transport, colonization, establishment, and landscape spread may be different steps in success of invasive plants in forest, and each and every step is checked through several ecological attributes. Further, several ecological attribute and hypothesis (enemy release, novel weapon, empty niche, evolution of increased competitive ability, etc.) were proposed pertaining to success of invasive plant species in forest ecosystems. However, a single theory will not be able to account for invasion success among all environments as it may vary spatially and temporally. Therefore, in order to formulate a sustainable management plan for invasive plants of forest, it is necessary to develop a synoptic view of the dynamic processes involved in the invasion process. Moreover, invasive species of forest can act synergistically with other elements of global change, including land-use change, climate change, increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and nitrogen deposition. Henceforth, a unified framework for biological invasions that reconciles and integrates the key features of the most commonly used invasion frameworks into a single conceptual model that can be applied to all human-mediated invasions.\\'Abstract: \\'An analysis of conflicts in environmental management has been made by identifying the major characteristics of conflicts.

Their distribution, conservation, mode of harvest by locals and optimal use require region-specific assessment in order to integrate them into developmental interventions. This study analyzed the collection, consumption, sale and income from edible forest fruits in 49 tribal villages spread over five districts of Orissa State in eastern India. Density, dominance and diversity of species yielding wild fruit were measured by studying ecological parameters in the sample plots. We estimated an average of 48 fruit plants per hectare of deciduous forests. Fifty-six wild edible fruit species belonging to 40 genera in 26 families were recorded in the study region, many of which have multiple uses. Indigenous fruits formed part of the family diet with average annual consumption of per household. Sale of wild fruits contributed of income for tribal households. Despite their good knowledge of indigenous fruits, the tribal populations have not adopted fruit tree farming which would enhance their nutrition and income.\\'Abstract: \\'This review is given on the origin and interrelationship of blackgram and greengram: the symptoms, mode of transmission, and host range of important diseases, namely: mungbean yellow mosaic virus, leaf crinkle virus, leaf curl virus, mosaic mottle virus, Cercospora leaf spot, powdery mildew, root and stem rots, bacterial leaf spot and halo blight.

The meteorological forcing consisting of future climatic inputs for the entire century for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios extracted from IITMRegCM4-4 predictions are used to simulate the future hydrological regime of the basin. The hydrological response analysis shows increase in annual discharge by 13.8 and under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. The hydrological extreme events are also found to increase under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios as compared with the past records of The peak discharge is observed to increase in the range of and under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. The study highlights that the annual water potential and hydrological extremes in the Krishna basin will increase under the future climatic scenarios.\\'Abstract: \\'The present study describes the plant propagation via indirect organogenesis from in vitro derived leaf and internode explants of Plectranthus bourneae, an endemic plant to south India. Leaf and internodal explants successfully callused on Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) supplemented with different concentrations of auxins [2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), NAA acetic acid), IAA (indole-3 acetic acid), IBA (indole-3-butyric acid) and PIC (Picloram); in combination with BA (6-benzyladenine) Maximum callus induction was achieved from leaf explant followed by internodal explant at NAA, BA. Leaf derived callus showed better shoot regeneration (29.71 shoots) on MS medium containing KN (kinetin), NAA, and CH (casein hydrolysate) followed by internodal callus (19.71). A maximum of 19.14 roots/shoot was observed at IBA. The rooted plantlets were successfully hardened and transferred to greenhouse condition with survival. This system could be utilized for large-scale multiplication of P. bourneae by tissue culture.\\'Abstract: \\'Agroforestry systems have been recognized as areas with high conservation potential, and there is a need to quickly assess the biodiversity and tree stocking density available in these systems. However, it is not clear if the commonly used fixed area plot is most efficient for sampling such landscapes, or if a different method could provide equivalent data with less effort. Thus, a field and simulation-based study was carried out to compare the efficiency and accuracy of a variable area transect versus the fixed area square plot. Field efficiency tests were carried out in three habitat types, robusta coffee plantations, arabica coffee plantations and a privately owned forest fragment, in Kodagu, southern India. A simulation study of bias, precision and accuracy of the two methods for tree density estimation also was carried out using various spatial distribution patterns and densities. The variable area transect was significantly more efficient per unit effort in the field than the fixed area square plot. In the simulation tests both methods performed equally well under random spatial distribution. However, under simulated aggregated distribution both methods were positively biased (square plot up to 12% at low density, variable area transect at all densities), and under simulated regular distribution the variable area transect was slightly negatively biased to at medium to high density). The variable area transect thus can be recommended over the square plot for rapid assessment of tree diversity and density, when the vegetation is expected to be randomly dispersed.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Qualitative reproductive traits of 84 plant species belonging to 41 families were studied in tropical dry evergreen forest on the Coromandel coast of India. Majority of species had rotate type, white-coloured, scented flowers, rewarding nectar and pollen and pollinated chiefly by bees. An association between floral traits and pollination spectrum is evident. Bee pollination was prevalent in pollination systems. Among the fruit types, drupe and berry were common in black and red colour respectively, and dispersed by zoochorous mode. Seeds of brown- and green-coloured dry fruits, without any reward were disseminated by wind and explosion. The reproductive phenophase of trees and lianas occurred mostly during the dry period from January to June, which receives rainfall of less than a month. However, shrubs showed a peak in flowering and fruiting in wet period. Detailed phenological observations of 22 woody species revealed a seasonal and unimodal pattern in flowering. Although some species were in flower round the year, flowering activity was skewed towards the dry season. The fruiting activity showed a bimodal pattern, one peak in dry season and another in wet season. Many species displayed a temporal aggregation in flowering and fruiting. The significant relation was obtained between reproductive traits and phenology of plants in the tropical dry evergreen forest.\\'Abstract: \\' Macrobrachium rosenbergii is an aquaculture species of global importance whose production has sharply declined since 2005. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in transcribed sequences are likely to have high association with economic traits and are important for marker assisted selection. SNPs were mined in 34 reported transcripts from 4 wild M. rosenbergii stocks of India using the amplicon approach and high-throughput sequencing platforms. Out of 320 SNPs detected, 134 were common to all stocks while 3 were diagnostic. Pair-wise genetic distances showed phylogeny consistent with geographical distribution. AMOVA analysis revealed estimated variance of 21.5 among populations. The transition to transversion ratio was 2.20. Changes in amino acid classes and peptide stability were recorded for 80 non-synonymous SNPs while change in codon preference was noted for 138 synonymous ones. Four pathogen defence genes were highly polymorphic, of which lectin 3 had the highest SNP rate (6 This approach for mining SNPs and using them for population differentiation in a single step is reported for the first time.\\'Abstract: \\'A rapid micropropagation system was established forHolostemma annulare (Roxb.) K. Schum., (H. ada-kodien R. Br. ex Schult; Asclepiadaceae), a rare medicinal plant. Shoot tips cm) and terminal and basal nodes cm) harvested from actively growing shoots of conventionally raised plants were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with various concentrations of 6-benzyladenine (BA) and acid (NAA). Multiple shoot formation (3.8) was observed in 68% of basal nodes cultured on medium with optimum concentration of 4.43 BA and 0.54 NAA after 8 wk. Terminal nodes were not suitable for inducing multiple shoots. Irrespective of the orientation (vertical/horizontal), all shoot tip explants responded with a single shoot in all the combinations of plant growth regulators tried. Effects of other cytokinins (kinetin and 2-isopentenyladenine) and auxins [indole-3-acetic acid and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA)] to enhance the regeneration potential of basal nodes were analyzed. Shoots were multiplied by subculture of basal nodes and stumps (the original explant tissue free of shoots, but with remnant axillary, meristem and two or three protruding buds) in a reduced concentration of BA (2.21 and NAA (0.27 Liquid medium for multiplication was found to be ineffective due to a high degree of hyperhydricity. To make the multiplication process cost effective, culture bottles with polypropylene, caps were used for multiplication. The best root induction (75%) and survival (80%) was achieved on 0.5 strength MS medium supplemented with 1.48 IBA. Field-established plants had uniform growth habit traits in terms of height of plants and number, length, and weight of the tuberous roots.\\'Abstract: \\'We evaluated trained acoustic sampling as a reliable and non-invasive method for rapid assessment of ensiferan species diversity in tropical evergreen forests. This was done by evaluating the reliability of identification of species and numbers of calling individuals using psychoacoustic experiments in the laboratory and by comparing psychoacoustic sampling in the field with ambient noise recordings made at the same time. The reliability of correct species identification by the trained listener was 100 % for 16 out of 20 species tested in the laboratory. The reliability of identifying the numbers of individuals correctly was 100% for 13 out of 20 species. The human listener performed slightly better than the instrument in detecting low frequency and broadband calls in the field, whereas the recorder detected high frequency calls with greater probability. To address the problem of pseudoreplication during spot sampling in the field, we monitored the movement of calling individuals using focal animal sampling. The average distance moved by calling individuals for 17 out of 20 species was less than in half an hour. We suggest that trained sampling is preferable for crickets and low frequency katydids, whereas broadband recorders are preferable for katydid species with high frequency calls for accurate estimation of ensiferan species richness and relative abundance in an area.\\'Abstract: \\'Environmental, biological, socio-cultural and economic status variation existing in the Central Himalaya have led to the evolution of diverse and unique traditional agroecosystems, crop species and livestock, which facilitate the traditional mountain farming societies to sustain themselves. Indigenous agroecosystems are highly site specific and differ from place to place, as they have evolved along divergent lines. For maintenance of traditional agrodiversity management the farmers of the Central Himalaya have evolved various types of crop rotations in consonance with the varied environmental conditions and agronomic requirements. In irrigated flat lands two crops are harvested in a year with negligible fallow period but in rainfed conditions if a cropping sequence is presumed to be starting after winter fallow phase then four major cropping seasons can be identified namely first kharif season (first crop season), first rabi season (second crop season), second kharif season (third crop season) and second rabi season (fourth crop season). Highest crop diversity is present in kharif season in comparison to rabi season. Traditionally the fields are left fallow after harvest of the second kharif season crop. Important characteristics of agrodiversity management are the use of bullocks for draught power, human energy as labour, crop residues as animal feed and animal waste mixed with forest litter as organic input to restore soil fertility levels. Women provide most of the human labour except for ploughing and threshing grain. The present study deals with assessment of traditional agrodiversity management such as (i) crop diversity, (ii) realized yield under the traditional practices and (iii) assess the differences of realized yields under sole and mixed cropping systems. It indicated that crop rotation is an important feature of the Central Himalayan village ecosystem which helps to continue the diversity of species grown, as are the distribution of crops in the growing period and the management of soil fertility. The cropping diversity existing and the sequences practiced by the traditional farmers seems to have achieved high degree of specialization and thus even when the yield/biomass variations are about 60%, the farmers continue to practice these sequences as they need to maintain diversity and synergistic relationships of crops in addition to manage the food and labour requirements for crop husbandry. Crop yields are generally higher in irrigated systems than rainfed systems and in sole cropping as compared with mixed cropping. However, gross biological and economic yields are higher in mixed cropping than sole cropping systems.\\'Abstract: \\'Realizing the potential of spaceborne multispectral measurements in providing spatial information on natural resources, and of Geographic Information System (GIS) in integrating such information with the socio-economic data and other collateral information to arrive at derivative information, we report here the results of a study which was taken up in a watershed in Charkhari block of Mahoba district, northern India, to generate the information on natural resources from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-1B) Linear Imaging Self-scanning Sensor (LISS-II) images through a systematic visual interpretation, and its subsequent integration with the collateral information in a GIS environment to develop optimal land use plan/action plan for sustainable development of its land resources. Since permanent vegetation cover in the watershed has been dwindling due to population pressure, the need for establishing more vegetation cover has been stressed.\\'Abstract: \\'Plant regeneration through direct somatic embryogenesis was achieved from root segments derived from in vitro shoots of Rauvolfia micrantha Hook. f. (Apocynaceae) grown for 6 wk in half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 3% sucrose, 100 myo-inositol, and 0.5 acid (NAA). The effects of photoperiod and plant growth regulators (PGRs) in half-strength MS medium were studied for the rapid and maximum induction of somatic embryos. The characteristic globular or heart-shaped stages of somatic embryogenesis were not found and cotyledonary stage embryos occasionally appeared without the intervention of callus in total darkness and 16-h photoperiod. Root segments cultured in the medium containing 0.1 NAA and 0.2 6-benzyladenine (BA) under 16-h photoperiod showed the maximum frequency (39%) of embryogenesis. The frequency of embryo formation was increased to 63% when they were cultured in medium with 0.1 NAA and 0.2 BA in the dark for 4wk, then grown under the 16-h photoperiod. Explants with developing embryos developed into plants after transfer to half-strength MS medium supplemented with 0.1 BA and 0.05 NAA. The well-developed plants were hardened and most plants (80%) survived and were phenotypically similar to the mother plants.\\'Abstract: \\'The protection and restoration of the environment is the responsibility of all.

A total of 111species, belonging to 103 genera in 53 families, were recorded from thefour sites, which together measure 15.6 ha. The number of woody species (girth at breast height(gbh) cm) was 20 each in Keezbuvanagiri (KBG) andKilialamman (KLM) grove, followed by 13 in Periyakattupalayam (PKP) and 15in Periyamudaliar chavadi (PMC). Based on the important value index (IVI), PMCgrove is an association of Aglaia elaeagnoidea,Borassus flabellifer and Pterospermumsuberifolium. A two-layered forest structure resembling tropical dryevergreen forest (TDEF) was found there. Stratification was obscured in the KBGgrove, as the scrub species were abundant, indicating a scrub woodland formation.PKP and KLM were characterised by the abundance of a few species. The presenceof a stout liana of Secamone emetica (gbh 35cm), the robustness of Cretaeva magna (gbh 220cm), Syzigium cumini (gbh 207.45cm), P. suberifolium (gbh 128.7cm) and Tamarindus indica (gbh 250cm), and survival of evergreen species like A.elaeagnoidea and Pamburus missionis isbotanically significant; Polyalthia suberosa is a raretaxon found only within the groves. The persistence of the groves until thepresent time is a testimony to the sacred grove status enjoyed by them.\\'Pradesh\\'Abstract: \\'Present study was carried out in Tirap district of Arunachal Pradesh characterized by mountainous terrain coupled with torrential rainfall. Forests and agriculture land cover are exposed to varied level of anthropogenic and deforestation activities. All these have augmented into pronounced soil erosion thereby negatively impacting the socio-economy of the rural population. Topographic, management, soil and landuse factors were among the most important drivers influencing the soil erosion. Keeping above in account, present study emphasizes the applicability of geospatial technology coupled with field data to estimate soil erosion rate which could be helpful in developing suitable management plan. Numerous empirical models are available for estimating soil erosion; however, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with geographic information system framework was applied in the current study due to its robustness and simplicity. RUSLE factors such as erosivity of rainfall (RE), erodibility of soil (ES), slope length (LS), crop management (CM) and conservation practice (CP) were calculated using available data. Rainfall erosivity factor was mm/ha/h/year. ES factor ranged from 0.16 to and LS factor ranges between 0 and 44.62. NDVI derived crop management factor ranges between 0 and 1.7. Conservation practice factor values ranged from 0.004 to 1. The annual soil loss was modeled using different factors of RULSE model and soil loss was predicted ton per hectare). Keeping threshold value of soil erosion ton per hectare) in account, most part of the study area is suitable for agriculture practices however, emphasis on suitable soil and water conservation measures are perquisite for sustainable environment management.\\'Abstract: \\'Understanding phyto-geographical distribution pattern and ethnobotanical applications are critical for comprehensive conservation and utilisation of native plant genetic resources. Dearth of such scientific reports on Corchorus species in India seriously compromises inclusiveness, precision and penetration of national endeavour to conserve the valuable resources. In this context, an ecogeographical study conducted to analyse geographical distribution, ecological adaptation, species richness and ethnobotanical applications of the genus in the country. The study revealed pandemic distribution of the genus with differential habitat preferences. Combine geographical, edaphic and precipitation based distribution profile of Corchorus spp. demonstrated multilayer interactions between species and environment that led to their differential spatial distribution. The highest species concentration was found in Tamil Nadu followed by Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Complementarity analysis showed that the major diversity hotspots for the genus present in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. Besides, wide spectrum ethnobotanical applications of the genus reflect their long association with prevailing ethnic communities across regions. Documentation of such time honoured traditional practices has special bearing on designing comprehensive conservation and management strategies. This information will help to prioritise both ex-situ and in-situ conservation efforts for the genus particularly in ecologically vulnerable sites of India.\\'Abstract: \\'The Late Cretaceous/Palaeogene Deccan Traps, spread over half a million square kilometres in west-central parts of the Indian Peninsula, comprises predominantly basalts and subordinate felsic rocks (rhyolite, trachyte, tinguaites and spilites). The use of Deccan basalts and trachyte in the range of Indian architectonic heritage, from antiquity to current times, is quite fascinating. The abundance and ease of workability of Deccan Trap rocks render them the most preferred building material in all the architectonic heritage structures that document various cultural and ethnic habitations in the west central India. The Buddhist, Hindu and Jain temples of Ajanta, Ellora and Elephanta are the oldest in-situ basalt cave temples, dating back to second century. A contemporary iconic architectonic heritage Gateway of personifies a majestic edifice built in buff coloured trachyte. In the present times, the Deccan basalts are being quarried for a variety of purposes such as masonry stone for buildings, road metal and as raw material for corrosion-resistant basaltic pipes and basalt wool that are also in great demand internationally. The trachyte quarries are almost extinct and relict trachyte outcrops are preserved in some places in and around Mumbai. The Deccan Trap rocks basalt and trachyte bear testimony to cultural and architectonic heritage, are therefore, the most suitable candidates for according the status of Global Heritage Stone Resource they fulfil all the requisite criteria specified by the IUGS subcommission on Hertaiage to as the Heritage Stone Subcommission (HSS). It is worthwhile to mention that both basalt and trachyte of the Deccan Traps are in geographic and geological proximity with each other and this qualifies Deccan Trap province to be recognised as a Global Heritage Stone Province (GHSP) from this subcontinent in consonance with the criteria for GHSP mentioned in the terms of reference given by HSS.\\'Abstract: \\'Agrobiodiversity is an evident outcome of a long-lasting relationship, as the continuous use, conservation and management of crops has resulted in biological as well as cultural diversity of seeds and breeds. This paper aims to understand the interlocking of formal and informal seed supply routes by considering the dynamic flow of seeds within networks across the intersections of gender, ethnicity and age in South India as social categories structuring relations. This changing relationship under formal and informal institutional settings has consequences on performance for men and women in rice seed systems. Undertaking an empirical analysis of the organization of seed management and exchange, we seek to shed light on the gendered organization of agrobiodiversity as a social network. The study builds on Net-Map interviews conducted in 2012, embedded in the larger BioDIVA project in the district of Wayanad in Kerala, India. Based on network analysis, the interactive method employed has enabled identification of important actors in the seed system and the characteristics of their relationships. We look into the gendered structure of information exchange regarding seed varieties and actual seed transactions, while also examining clusters of actors collaborating regarding seed supply. Finally, we identify the institutional gap concerning seed sources left by formal and informal institutions, like the availability of varieties. We show how informal and formal seed systems coexist and overlap due to actors moving between systems and argue that the degree and areas of overlap are shaped by gendered relations.\\'Abstract: \\'Multiple shoots were obtained on MS medium containing\\'Abstract: \\'A survey of anthropological, archaeological, botanical, and historical literature reveals that two species of fox-tail millet were domesticated in the Old World (S. italica, S. pumila), and one may have been domesticated in the New World (S. parviflora).

Analyses showed that the concentrations of Mg2+ exceeded Ca2+ in both the seasons suggesting silicate weathering as a source of ions. Average values contribute 73.53% of total cations and signify the major supply of mafic minerals. Elevated TDS and TH limit drinking potential and other beneficial uses indicate permanently hard water. The average concentrations of the anions were found within Indian PL except NO3, attributed to use of fertilizers. The spatial distribution maps show the EC, Mg, Na, Cl, and SO4 to be generally higher for both the seasons in flood plain deposits than denuded landforms and middle-level/high-level plateaus containing fractured basalt aquifers. It is confirmed that silicate weathering is the dominant process followed by carbonate weathering. Inputs of TDS, Cl, SO4, Mg, Na, and NO3 are influenced by rainfall and human activities. Groundwater sample numbers 20, 37, and 38 have been severely impacted from agricultural runoff as these samples are located along the surface water flow path. The high loading of TDS and TH is controlled by the Mg, Na, Cl, and SO4 ions. Elevated concentration of Na over Ca represents the ion exchange between Ca and Na. High contents of Mg, Na, Cl, and SO4 corroborate that the groundwater is influenced by anthropogenic sources. This study is an insight for water managers to address groundwater pollution problems.\\'Abstract: \\'Systematic seasonal variations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) along a 44-km transect of the Mandovi estuary reveal that the concentrations of SPM are low at river-end stations, increase generally seaward, and are highest at sea-end stations of the estuary. An estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) occurs at sea-end stations during when river discharge is high and also in when river discharge is low. These are the two windiest times of year, the former associated with the southwest monsoon and the latter characterized by a persistent sea breeze. The salinity vs. SPM plot shows that high SPM is a seaward deposit and skewed landward. Suspended matter comprised of floccules, fecal pellets, and aggregates that consist of clay and biogenic particles occur everywhere in the estuary. Diatoms are the most common and are of marine type at the sea-end and freshwater-dominated at river-end stations of the estuary. SPM is characterized by kaolinite- and smectite-rich clay mineral suites at the river- and sea-end stations, respectively. Smectite concentrations increase seawards with the increase in SPM content and are not influenced by salinity. Wind-driven waves and currents and biogeochemical processes at the mouth of estuary likely play an important role in the formation of ETM in resuspension and transformation of SPM into floccules and aggregates and in their upkeep or removal.\\'Abstract: \\'Shoot multiplication of Curculigo orchioides Gaertn (Kali Musali), a threatened medicinal herb, was achieved using shoot bud explants.

Plantlets were acclimatized before successful transfer to soil. The developed protocol demonstrates the use of spermidine for mass propagation that can help in conservation of germplasm of Curculigo orchioides.\\'Abstract: \\'The group size, age and sex ratio of gaur was studied in the Tropical Deciduous habitat of Kuldiha Wildlife Sanctuary, Odisha, eastern India, during Gaurs were observed by regular monitoring along the motorable roads and forest trails covering a total The overall mean group size and crowding were (SE) and 6.9 respectively which varied significantly between seasons. The sex ratio was skewed to females and there was an increase in adult male ratio during winter season. Calves were observed throughout the year with a slightly peak during December and January. Compared to the gaur population from other regions of India, the group size range in Kuldiha Wildlife Sanctuary is the smaller one, thus indicating a low population density. Therefore, appropriate management intervention is required for long term conservation of the species.\\'incorporated indigenous values. In many cases, even though indigenous people rely substantially on aquatic resources, environmental flows have been assumed to be an acceptable surrogate for the protection of indigenous interests. This paper argues that the need to adapt flow assessments to account for linkages and dependencies between people and rivers is equally applicable to developed world indigenous contexts such as Australia as it is to developing countries where there has been some attempt to address indigenous or subsistence water requirements. We propose three challenges to conventional environmental flow assessments that, if met, will improve the ability of water resource planning to address indigenous interests. The first challenge is to recognize that in an indigenous context a different suite of species may be considered important when compared to those valued by other stakeholders. Although conservation status or rarity may be important, it is common and widespread species that make substantial contributions to indigenous household incomes through customary use. The second challenge is to accommodate a different set of management objectives in environmental flow allocation. Environmental flows will need to meet the requirement of hunting and fishing activities at rates that are socially and economically sustainable. The third and arguably most theoretically challenging task is for environmental flow assessments to take into account indigenous worldviews and the quality of relationships that are significant in indigenous cultures. Meeting these three challenges to environmental flow assessment will assist water management agencies and other practitioners to protect indigenous interests as water allocation decisions are made.\\'Abstract: \\'We identified 67 and 21 NTFP-yielding plant and animal species, respectively, in a reserve forest in Cachar district of Assam.

Investigation on changes in endogenous ABA content of Saraca asoca seeds during development and artificial dehydration by indirect competitive ELISA method explains their influence on viability. The low ABA levels towards later stages of seed development validates non-orthodox nature of species. About 37% germination was observed in immature seeds of after anthesis onwards, which possess comparatively higher ABA content of In the course of seed maturation gradual loss of ABA was noticed with concurrent increase in germination. Artificial seed drying in open laboratory condition for five different periods, viz., 48, 96, 144, 192 and registered 49.7, 48.4, 46.9, 45.2 and 42.8% moisture contents, respectively, in fresh and mature seeds as control which possess moisture content of 51.6 with 100% germination.

So the present study deals with the influence of abscisic acid in desiccation tolerance during maturation and dehydration of recalcitrant seeds of Saraca asoca.\\'Abstract: \\'In a major deviation from conventional joint forest management approaches where the emphasis of management is on provision of forest products to the participating villagers, the Tamil Nadu Afforestation Project (TAP) focused on poverty alleviation as the principal means to achieve sustainable forest management. This study assesses the effectiveness of strategy in improving the ecology and socio-economic conditions of forest fringe villages using a diverse set of research methods. Results indicate that in a span of four to seven years, there was significant increase in forest cover, biodiversity, and agricultural productivity. The project villages have also shown considerable progress in various indicators of socio-economic development. The authors, however, suggest continued poverty alleviation and promotion of alternative livelihood opportunities to place the programme on a stable ground. Meeting the development needs of local villagers through strong and durable institutional linkages is also suggested for the programme to sustain and succeed.\\'Abstract: \\'In recent years, invasion of native grasslands by exotic woody plants has been recognized as a global problem with multiple adverse ecological and socio-economic consequences. Reasons for such expansions are numerous, including fire suppression. An important example of this problem is the native montane grassland in the Nilgiris of the Western Ghats in India, a biodiversity hotspot threatened by invasion of multiple woody species. In this study, the impacts of the highly invasive, nitrogen fixing exotic shrub Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) on the grassland community and ecosystem function have been quantified and the role of fire as a potential management tool evaluated. I established paired plots in uninvaded and broom-invaded grasslands that were either unburned or burned by an unplanned wildfire event. Invasion negatively impacted the grassland community structure and composition, favoring shade tolerant and weedy native plants, but did not greatly alter ecosystem function. Burning broom patches to eliminate the stands resulted in lower soil moisture and nitrogen levels after the fire. Yet, there were no notable fire effects on the grassland communities or ecosystem properties. Taken together, the results suggest that fire might be an effective tool for broom control. At the end of the study period burned-broom communities did not become more similar to uninvaded-grasslands; presumably the recovery process may be slow without additional management intervention.\\'Abstract: \\'\\'Abstract: \\'The Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) LISS III satellite imagery was used to classify three landscapes in the upper Satluj river watershed in Kinnaur region of western Himalaya viz. Nichar, Kalpa and Pooh. These landscapes representing different eco-climatic zones were subjected to landscape ecological analysis and various landscape composition, patch and edge characteristic metrics were computed to find the extent of fragmentation in the natural vegetation. The natural vegetation comprised of forests (10.24%), grasslands (31.04%) and scrublands (2.95%) as the landscape elements (LSE). These LSEs were further segregated into different LSE types based on the dominant species of plant communities in the landscapes. These LSE types were surveyed for species diversity in the three landscapes. The total landscape area (TLA) covered by natural vegetation in Nichar, Kalpa and Pooh landscapes was calculated to be 651.42, 529.02 and making the total area covered with natural vegetation in the district as The Pooh block, lying in the east of the district, though covered the largest area of the landscape, was poor in terms of landscape composition as compared to the Nichar block which was rich in landscape elements as suggested by the diversity measures. The extent of fragmentation was found to be highest in Nichar. The Nichar landscape was observed to be having higher mean values of species diversity than other blocks which is consistent with the trends observed with patches diversity. This was in contrast to the Pooh landscape where the patch diversity as well as the species diversity was the lowest. Thus, an ecological analysis utilizing landscape metrics and biodiversity field sampling of vegetation, was attempted for such heterogenous landscapes in high altitudes of Himalaya, which provided a baseline data for the management and conservation of these virgin mountainous areas.\\'Abstract: \\'Sustainable use of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) can be affected by levels of extractions as well as by other anthropogenic influences such as fire and grazing. We examined the effects of fire on the demography of Phyllanthus emblica, an important NTFP in the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills, India. We then assessed demographic responses to the combined effects of fire and current fruit harvesting patterns. Fruits of Phyllanthus are commercially harvested by an indigenous forest dwelling people.

Our findings provide critical information for developing guidelines for sustainable use and management of NTFPs in Biligiri Rangan Hills, and demonstrate the need to incorporate various human-generated physical regimes in assessing sustainability of NTFPs.\\'Abstract: \\'This paper presents a detailed analysis of a composite Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI) to examine and compare climate change vulnerability and its dimensions adaptive capacity, sensitivity and exposure. Thereby, we are mainly interested on climate change vulnerability at community-level watershed development programmes and how the different implementing agencies could help to address the problems associated with climate change in future planning and implementation.\\'central Brazil\\'Abstract: \\'The handicrafts made fromSyngonanthus nitens scapes have been an important source of income for rural communities in the region of Brazil since the late 1990s. This study analyzedS. nitens harvest and management techniques and the economic importance of the handicrafts. We also tested the effects of harvest onS. nitens population ecology. Handicrafts provide about US$1,800/year per artisan, being especially important to women. Experimental scape harvesting in mid-October, which is when knowledgeable artisans harvest and when the seeds are mature, had no consistent effects on population density, plant survival, or reproduction (clonal or sexual) after one year. Since 40% of the new recruits come from seeds, harvest after seed maturation, combined with removal of only the scapes and not the flowerheads, can allow forS. nitens seeds to remain in the populations and help ensure sustainability of the growingS. nitens handicraft activity. Important economic aspects ofS. nitens harvest sustainability include the high value of the handicrafts and the fact they are not perishable.\\'Abstract: \\'Kuttiyadi river basin in the South Indian state of Kerala has been analyzed for planning watershed management activities. Geohydrological behavior of the watershed was analyzed by calculating the morphometric parameters. Linear, relief, and areal parameters were determined using standard equations. Kuttiyadi is a sixth order basin, characterized by maximum relief and gradients in the eastern part, exhibiting highest runoff and susceptibility to flooding and inundation. Relative drainage density data suggest that subwatersheds II and III are mature basins in steady state equilibrium with components like climate, lithology, tectonism, and landscape components. Multi criteria decision making approach was followed for watershed prioritization. Given the interrelationship that exists among the different morphometric parameters as well as the complexity due to the integrated effect of these parameters on soil erosion, analytic network process was employed. Length of overland flow was found to be the most influential morphological parameter in watershed prioritization. High priority subwatershed identified in this study must be taken up for immediate action with respect to soil conservation activities. Suitable locations for construction of check-dams as water conservation structures were identified. This study has shown that morphometric analysis along with multi criteria decision making would serve as a powerful tool in watershed planning where complex interrelationship exists among different morphological parameters.\\'Abstract: \\'Landforms of Mumbai Island have been largely modified by the urban sprawl and the demand for groundwater will increase exponentially in the future. Quality and quantity of groundwater occurrence in island are highly influenced by the geomorphic units. As this metropolis receives heavy rainfall, the area rarely faces the issue of water scarcity, nevertheless, quality always remains a question. The landforms of Mumbai Island have been shaped by a combination of fluvial, denudational and marine processes. These landforms are categorized into two broad zones on the basis of its influence in groundwater occurrence. Denudational landforms are categorized as runoff zones whereas the other two are categorized as storage zones. This classification is on the basis of occurrence and storage of groundwater. Mumbai Island is exposed to frequent sea water incursion and groundwater quality has deteriorated. The varied hydrogeological conditions prevalent in this area prevent rapid infiltration. This combined with the overextraction of groundwater resources for agriculture and industry has caused serious concern about the continued availability of potable water. This study aims at validating the geomorphic classification of the landforms with hydrogeochemistry and borehole data and it proved that geomorphology corroborates with groundwater chemistry and subsurface geology.\\'Abstract: \\'In the present manuscript, we analyzed the pre-monsoon rainfall over the Indian summer monsoon region using the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) rainfall datasets during It is found that the rainfall over the Bay of Bengal (BOB) has increased significantly and it is associated with the strengthening of local Hadley circulation over the BOB. The increasing Sea Surface Temperature (SST) over the Indian Ocean is playing an important role to the observed changes in convections and cloudiness over the BOB. In addition, the strengthening of the westerly enhances the wind speed and transports more moisture to the North Indian Ocean. In addition, warming of the SST and large-scale moisture convergence cause the rainfall to increase and the latent heat released in the process strengthens the divergent wind at This strengthens the local Hadley circulation over the BOB, which may affect the monsoon strength over the Indian subcontinent, by influencing the onset of the Indian summer monsoon. This study will improve the understanding by monitoring the changes in the atmospheric processes over the BOB and the Indian subcontinent, which may result in better predictability of the Indian summer monsoon.\\'Abstract: \\'In the Indian subcontinent there is hardly any study that compares the bird community structure of urban/suburban areas with those of forest habitat. The present survey identified diverse assemblages of birds in the Pauri district at different elevations. A total of 125 bird species belonging to 40 families including two least count species (Lophura leucomelanos and Pucrasia marcolopha) were recorded during this survey in the forest and urbanized habitats of Pauri District (Garhwal Hiamalaya) of Uttarakhand state, India. The high elevation (Pauri m a.s.l.), mid elevation (Srikot-Khanda m a.s.l.) and low elevation (Srinagar m a.s.l.) contributed 88.8%, 63.2% and 58.4% of the total species respectively. Rarefaction analysis and Shannon diversity index showed that the high elevation forest habitat had highest bird species richness (BSR) and bird species diversity (BSD) followed by the mid and then the low elevation forests. BSR and BSD fluctuated across seasons at all elevations but not across habitat types. Present study provides a base line data about avian community composition in urbanized and natural habitats along altitudinal gradient in the study area. This information may be useful to the conservation biologists for the better management and conservation of the avifauna in the Western Himalaya, a part of one of the hot biodiversity spots of the world.\\'Abstract: \\'Forest fire has profound impacts on atmospheric chemistry, biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem structure. This feedback interaction may be hastened in climate change scenarios. In view of this, the present day knowledge about the forest fire condition in India has been reviewed. Operational monitoring, geospatial modelling and climate change uncertainties are discussed. Indicators for forest fire assessment and the role of geoinformatics tools in developing those parameters are identified. The need for developing an adaptive management strategy from the existing experience is emphasized, and specific points are recommended sector-wise with short- and long-term visions.\\'Abstract: \\' Agrobacterium rhizogenes mediated transformation of Decalepis arayalpathra, an ethnomedicinal plant, was achieved by infecting juvenile hypocotyl explants with different strains, including A4, MTCC 532, TR105 and LBA 5402. Hypocotyl explants induced hairy roots at a higher frequency than cotyledons when infected with the most virulent strain TR105. The explants co-cultivated in half-strength salts and vitamins of Murashige and Skoog basal medium (half-MSB) induced hairy roots either directly from the wounds or followed by the formation of gall like structures. Irrespective of the explants, the strain MTCC 532 induced callus alone. The root initials on the galls proliferated vigorously and elongated more rapidly when they were segmented and subcultured on half-MSB medium than the proliferation and elongation of directly emerged roots. The established hairy roots showed intermittent gall formation which was the active sites for hairy roots induction. The molecular evidence of rol A and rol C gene integration was confirmed by PCR amplification  and southern blot hybridization. Growth of the hairy roots was undertaken by measuring root growth unit after culturing root tips in half-MSB solid medium and determined fresh weight/dry weight/conductivity during time-course study in shake flask cultures. The maximum biomass and accumulation of the root specific compound, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzaldehyde (MBALD) dry weight), was recorded at the 6th week of growth, which was more than that observed in normal root cultures dry weight).\\'Abstract: \\'Micropropagation of Embelia ribes was achieved through proliferation of axillary shoots obtained from mature plants. Nodal shoot segments, collected exhibited high-frequency (75%) shoot initiation when cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium supplemented with thidiazuron (TDZ) at and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) at Subculture of sprouted shoots from the original explants on medium containing TDZ (1.13 and during the first and second subcultures was found essential for further shoot proliferation, while inhibition of shoot elongation by TDZ could be overcome by transferring shoot cultures onto MS medium containing 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP; for the third subculture. Treating the explants with an antioxidant mixture of ascorbic acid, citric acid, and glutathione prior to inoculation, coupled with subculture at 2-wk intervals onto fresh medium, both helped to reduce browning of the explants and facilitated production of five to six shoots/explant. MS medium supplemented with BAP and IBA induced shoot multiplication, producing five to six shoots/explant with a shoot length of 3 to over a 4-wk culture period. Shoots of 3 to in length exhibited 100% rooting within after transfer to media containing half the nutrient salt concentration of MS medium with IBA. Ex vitro rooting in the greenhouse from the in vitro shoots treated with IBA for exhibited 95% rooting in medium in a 4-wk period. About 85% of micropropagated plants were established successfully in root trainers. Three-month-old, hardened plants could further be successfully established in the field. In by using the above protocol, 3,200 plants could be produced from a single shoot and 2,700 could be established in the field.\\'Abstract: \\'Agroforestry systems usually include a high density and diversity of shade trees. Such systems often have a large diversity of fauna and flora and provide local and regional ecosystem services. Shade trees are, however, being removed to increase crop production in many tropical regions. There is little knowledge on the effect of shade trees on crop production in the context of trade-offs with other management practices. We therefore compared the benefits of exotic versus native shade trees on coffee production. We evaluated the importance of shade tree management for crop production in the context of management practices. Management practices included fertilization, liming, coffee pruning, weeding, and irrigation in 113 coffee agroforests in Kodagu, India, over a wide range of shade tree density, tree species diversity, and shade cover. We studied, in particular, Grevillea and non-Grevillea shade trees, the latter including mostly native tree species. Results show that a rise of 100 non-Grevillea shade tree per hectare increased production of berries by and larger beans by Irrigation and liming increased berry production respectively by 16 and These management interventions are likely to offset the relatively small negative effect of reducing shade density of non-Grevillea trees on coffee production. Recommendations based on an understanding of shade tree management alone can be misleading with regard to crop production.\\'jewel orchid\\'Abstract: \\'An efficient in vitro plant regeneration system was established through somatic embryogenesis for Anoectochilus elatus Lindley, an endangered jewel orchid. Direct somatic embryogenesis was achieved from nodal explants (17.4 embryos per explant with 63.4% response) on Mitra medium supplemented with Morel vitamins, thidiazuron and acid Simultaneously, a protocol was developed somatic embryogenesis from internodal explant, produced embryogenic calli and embryos (31.3 embryos with 76.4% response) on same medium amended with peptone and 5% coconut water. Both types of embryogenic pathways, produced morphologically similar globular embryos in the form of protocorm like bodies and successfully germinated on hormone free Mitra medium supplemented with Morel vitamins. Morpho-histological investigation of the embryo revealed and developmental features of somatic embryos. In vitro regenerated plantlets were successfully established from heterotrophic to a photoautotrophic stage by reducing the nutrient content in culture media, adjusting temperature and humidity through three step method. During the process, no morphological and physiological abnormalities were observed. Hardened plantlets were successfully acclimatized at poly tunnel chamber with 95% of survival rate. Further, inter simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) molecular markers were used to analyse the genetic homogeneity of regenerated plants. Analysis with this method showed that the homogeneity is comparatively higher in direct somatic embryo regenerated plants (94.22%) as compared to plants elevated from an indirect somatic embryo (93.05%). The present study provides morpho-histological and genetically stable plants for germplasm conservation and further utility of this endangered jewel orchid.\\'Abstract: \\'An efficient in vitro regeneration protocol through somatic embryogenesis was established from stem transverse thin cell layers (tTCLs) of Dendrobium aqueum Lindley, an imperiled orchid. This study outlines the induction and successive maturation stages of D. aqueum somatic embryos (SEs). The tTCLs (~ 0.5 mm thick) cultured on halfstrength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing cytokinins and auxins, either individually or in combination, produced embryogenic callus (EC). Treatment with 0.5 mg dm-3 zeatin induced EC in 41.42 % of tTCLs. As many as 42.66 globular SEs per tTCL were formed in the presence of 1.5 mg dm-3N6-(2-isopentyl) adenine (2iP) but only on 10.33 % of explants. The combined treatment of 2iP (1.5 mg dm-3) and 0.5 mg dm-3 6-benzyladenine resulted in 34 globular SEs on 14.7 % of tTCLs whereas the combination of 2iP and 1.0 mg dm-3 indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) induced 7.4 globular SEs on 52.33 % of tTCLs. Supplementation of activated charcoal, amino acids, and antioxidants alleviated browning at all the concentrations tested, but the EC response declined. The addition of 0.5 mg dm-3 polyvinylpyrrolidone to 1.5 mg dm-3 2iP and 1.0 mg dm-3 IBA produced 24 SEs on 19.89 % of tTCLs suggesting that the EC and SEs can be effectively induced by individual cytokinins whereas the synergistic treatments with other compounds can only enhance the induction of EC. Histological observations of EC showed the formation of globular SEs from sub-epidermal regions. Successive developmental stages of globular SEs and the intermediate stage of protocorm like bodies until the formation of plantlets were observed. The plantlets obtained through SEs showed no morphological variations, and inter simple sequence repeat profiles also confirmed the genetic fidelity of in vitro-derived progeny with high monomorphism (97.78 %). In conclusion, the use of stem tTCLs is an effective method to produce SEs through indirect somatic embryogenesis in D. aqueum.\\'Abstract: \\' In vitro propagation of three rare, endangered and endemic rhododendron dalhousiae var. rhabdotum, R. elliottii, and R. attained. Nodal explants were used for multiple shoot induction studies. Three cytokinins (isopentenyladenine, benzyladenine, and kinetin) were evaluated in all three species. Isopentenyladenine performed better in all three species, especially at the concentration of 39.36 Testing of combinations of growth regulators revealed that explants grown on Anderson medium supplemented with 39.36 isopentenyladenine and 4.90 indole butyric acid gave optimum results with 100% multiple shoot induction, 18 shoots per explant, and shoot length of 2.07 cm with R. johnstoneanum. Indole butyric acid was found to be the best auxin for root formation. Around 60% of the in vitro-raised plants of R. elliottii, R. johnstoneanum, and R. dalhousiae var. rhabdotum were able to establish ex vitro.\\'Abstract: \\'Morphometric analysis is an indispensable tool for hydrological investigation that involves the development and management of drainage basin. This study characterizes the micro watersheds in the Palar sub-watershed using morphometric analysis and assesses its risk by land use and land cover features in a particular micro watershed. Palar sub-watershed is divided into 6 micro watersheds for prioritization based on morphometric and land use analysis. Several morphometric parameters (linear, shape and relief) are determined from the drainage map; ranks are assigned based on their capacity to induce erodability and degradation. Final ranking is based on the composite index calculated from the sum of the ranks of each morphometric parameter. Morphometric analysis reveals micro watersheds 5 and 6 as most susceptible and 2 and 3 as low susceptible. Land use is mapped using IRS ID LISS III satellite data. The risk in terms of watershed degradation involved to each micro watershed is based on the ranks of each land use feature, obtained from a similar composite index as that of morphometric analysis. Land use analysis shows that micro watersheds 2 and 4 fall under high priority category while 5 and 6 under low priority category. Integration of the morphometric and land use analysis shows that only micro watershed 1 falls under the same category in both analyses. Control measures are suggested to contain degradation depending on its specific land use pattern and morphometric features. This study can be used to prepare a comprehensive watershed plan for the development or for planning resource conservation strategies, by integrating land use features with the drainage characteristics of the region, in particular for a hill ecosystem as the prioritization is at micro level.\\'Abstract: \\'Long before the applications of Science and Technology for conservation of biodiversity and sustainable development became a recognized field of human endeavour, there have been attempts by individuals and institutions who had the commitment and wisdom to begin the effort. The authors have chosen historical incidents tracing the rudiments of the work of Emperor Ashoka, to the Bishnois of Rajasthan, John Muir, a Scottish-born American in USA, Richard St. Barbe Baker and Wangari Maathai in Africa. People such as Chico Mendes lost their life in preventing the destruction of great Amazonian forest and N. I. Vavilov, a Russian geneticist who foresaw the value of collecting large samples of seeds of cultivated plants in seed banks, much against the then prevalent communist doctrine, not believing in the importance of inheritance. The Chipko movement in Garhwal Himalaya started by Gaura devi and other womenfolk supported by Chandi Prasad Bhat and Sunderlal Bahuguna has been briefly traced. References are also made to the work of Jim Corbett and Salim Ali for the conservation of tigers and birds respectively and recounting the enormous movement to save Silent Valley representing tropical evergreen forest in Kerala from being utilized for generating a very small amount of power. The decision taken by Government of India to refuse Vedanta Resources from utilizing the Niyamgiri Hills in Orissa for bauxite mining which is considered as an abode of their Niyamraja, worshipped by the Dongaria Kondh tribe consisting of 8,000 people has been hailed by the Indian people as just. Finally attention is drawn to Prof. A. efforts to develop a Tropical Botanical Garden and Research Institute in Kerala for collection, conservation and sustainable utilization of 800 medicinal plants, orchids, bamboos and other useful tropical plants. A brief note on the intense efforts made by K. S. Manilal in bringing out English and Malayalam Editions of Hortus Malabaricus compiled by Van Rheede in 12 volumes in old Latin between 1678 and 1693 and in publishing the Flora of Silent Valley has been included.\\'Abstract: \\'Studying biodiversity change in existing typical ecosystems of the world under possible global climate change and local human activities is important for diversity conservation. An adapted forest dynamics model is used to simulate tree diversity change of the remaining primary mixed-broadleaved Korean pine forest (RPMKPF) in northeast China under global climate change and local human activities for the next 50 years. Human activities include logging, which removes all big trees (DBH > 50 cm), removing all individuals of each single species and all species of each functional type (shade tolerant, shade intolerant and medium type tree species). As results for RPMKPF, the index of tree diversity decreases under climate change, but it increases significantly under a combination of climate change and logging. Removing all individuals of each single species significantly affects the tree diversity of the ecosystem. After the removal of shade tolerant species, both and indices of tree diversity experience a significant change. The index decreases significantly under climate change when shade intolerant or medium type tree species are removed, but the index does not change significantly. The results of this study have implications for tree diversity management in RPMKPF under climate change and human activities.\\'Abstract: \\'N2 fixation (acetylene reduction assay) by phylloplane microorganisms was measured in dominant and co-dominant plant species growing in a tropical rain forest. No significant acetylene reduction was recorded with intact leaf samples. Azotobacter sp., Beijerinckia sp., Derxia sp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated as phylloplane N2-fixing bacteria. Azospirillum lipoferum was only isolated from soil samples containing the roots of Poaceae. Nitrogenase activity was recorded in culture derived from the roots and rhizosphere soil samples, although low acetylene reduction activity indicates that these associations did not provide large amounts of N to the systems studied.\\'Abstract: \\'Ophiorrhiza mungos var. angustifolia is a herbaceous plant distributed in the southern western ghats of India. The species is extensively uprooted for the extraction of high-value anticancer alkaloid camptothecin (CPT), resulting in the eradication of natural population. The present work aims to develop an in vitro protocol for the sustainable production of CPT from callus and cell suspension cultures of the species to conserve the natural resource. Leaf explant excised from in vitro shoot cultures was inoculated onto solid half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium, fortified with auxins like Indole acetic acid Indole butyric acid Naphthalene acetic acid 2,4 Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and Picloram either individually or in combination with to raise the callus. Of the different combinations of auxins, Naphthalene acetic Benzyladenine was selected as the best combination to produce maximum fresh weight of callus. The CPT content of callus was estimated as DW. Friable calli produced were used to raise cell suspension cultures in half strength MS liquid medium, fortified with different concentrations of auxins. Maximum fresh weight was yielded by a medium supplemented with Naphthalene acetic acid Highest CPT content was estimated in a medium supplemented with Naphthalene acetic acid as DW. When compared with the CPT content of field plants, it was found to be higher.\\'Abstract: \\'Socioecology suggests that female distribution in space is determined by the distribution of food resources and the male distribution is influenced by female distribution. Though studies have traditionally focused on females, males have received increasing attention in recent years. We compared relationships in lion-tailed macaques and bonnet macaques. Because bonnet macaques have a high adult male:female sex ratio and are seasonal breeders whereas lion-tailed macaques have a low adult male:female sex ratio and are largely aseasonal breeders, we predicted that bonnet macaque males would be spatially and socially more tolerant of each other and would have less linear dominance relationships than lion-tailed macaques. We recorded and relationships in 1 group of wild macaques of each species via scan sampling and sampling. The results revealed that lion-tailed macaque males largely remained at a distance from each other whereas bonnet macaque males remained in close proximity to one another. Lion-tailed macaque males were more agonistic toward each other whereas bonnet macaque males showed more affiliative interactions. The dominance hierarchy among lion-tailed macaque males was more linear than among bonnet macaque males. Our data support the hypothesis that the study of spatial structuring, temporality of interactions, and linearity of social relationships may contribute to a better understanding of macaque social systems.\\'anti-carcinogenic molecule\\'Abstract: \\'Camptothecin (CPT), a monoterpene indole alkaloid, is a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I and has applications in treating ovarian, small lung and refractory ovarian cancers. Stem wood tissue of Nothapodytes nimmoniana (Graham) Mabb. (family Icacinaceae) is one of the richest sources of CPT. Since there is no genomic or transcriptome data available for the species, the present work sequenced and analysed transcriptome of stem wood tissue on an Illumina platform. From a total of 77,55,978 reads, 9,187 transcripts were assembled with an average length of 255 bp. Functional annotation and categorization of these assembled transcripts unraveled the transcriptome architecture and also a total of 13 genes associated with CPT biosynthetic pathway were identified in the stem wood tissue. Four genes of the pathway were cloned to full length by RACE to validate the transcriptome data. Expression analysis of 13 genes associated with CPT biosynthetic pathway in 11 different tissues CPT content analysis suggested an important role of NnPG10H, NnPSLS and NnPSTR genes in the biosynthesis of CPT. These results indicated that CPT might be synthesized in the leaves and then perhaps exported to stem wood tissue for storage.\\'Abstract: \\'The present study aims the evaluation of bio-physical characteristics towards soil-water-vegetation stress and a rule is envisaged to assess the degree of temporal changes. The digital rule for assessment is initialized through the index of land Instability (ILI) where the variance indicates the temporal instability of the pixel i.e., smallest land unit. It is assumed that the biophysical characteristic of land is in command of land-dynamics where there is no change in Land Use/Land Cover (LU&LC). The intensity map on tendency of albedo (IALB) assesses the intensity of soil erosion and water stress whereas intensity map on tendency of NDVI (INDVI) appraises the stress on vegetation. The carry-out study covers a part of semiarid Western India. Primarily remote sensing technique, which carries the digital information of land temporally and spatially, is adopted in this paper. A part of the study area is represented using two sets of IRS 1A/1B LISS-I data of March with a decadal time domain as a test area. It is assumed that the soil-water-vegetation stress is maximum during summer in any tropical belt and decadal data will stretch the possibility of climate as well as man-made activity over the land.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'An ethnobotanical survey was carried out to collect information on the use of medicinal plants in Southern Western Ghats of India (Madurai district, Tamil Nadu).

We here examine ecological niche differentiation in 2 sympatric Asian langurs, Presbytis potenziani and Simias concolor, both endemic to the Mentawai Islands off the west coast of Sumatra. We collected data (home range size, canopy use, activity budgets, diet, and niche breadth and overlap) using GPS and scan/focal animal sampling methods on 2 groups of Presbytis potenziani and 3 groups of Simias concolor living in a mixed primary rain forest in northern Siberut. Results show that home ranges of the 2 species overlapped completely and that the home range size of Presbytis potenziani was ca. 4 times larger than that of Simias concolor. Lower canopy levels were used more often by Simias concolor, whereas Presbytis potenziani preferred the canopy Apart from foraging and other activities, there was little difference in overall activity budgets of the 2 species. Regarding diet, although 60% of all food species examined were used by both langur species, they shared only 3 of the 10 most commonly eaten species. Presbytis potenziani fed more selectively on fruits, whereas Simias concolor fed predominantly on leaves. niche breadth indices revealed that the diet of Simias concolor is more general (0.34) than that of Presbytis potenziani (0.22). Based on a Pianka index of 0.32, we conclude that there is a relatively small food niche overlap between the 2 colobine species and that diet represents an important mechanism enabling their coexistence.\\'Abstract: \\'On a standard shoot culture medium, nodal cultures of Sarpagandha (Rauvolfia serpentina) could be maintained for nine months at C by replacing cotton plugs with polypropylene caps as enclosures for culture tubes.

During such longtime of survey, the siltation pattern and the bed levels also get changed. So, the need to update the sediment measurement techniques and to introduce latest technology available in the field was felt to overcome the difficulties faced in the conventional method especially in major reservoirs. With this objective, the present study of the assessment of the sedimentation in Linganmakki reservoir is carried out using remote sensing and GIS techniques. The revised capacities in the zone of reservoir levels (533.05 548.78 m) for the year and in the zone of 532.20 545.91 m of reservoir levels were determined, which is found 2837.84 M cum and 2207.95 M cum respectively. Based on these results, the sedimentation rates in the zone (533.05 548.78 m) come out to be 8.96 ham/100 km2/year and for the zone (532.20 545.91 m) is 8.57 ha-m/100 km2/year. It is found that the results are comparable during and the uniform sediment rate of 8.57 ha-m/100 km2/ year can be considered.\\'Abstract: of catchment erosion and the resultant reservoir siltation from a tropical environment is reported here to discuss the effect of a reservoir in the natural degradation of an evergreen-forested segment. While an area of has been affected by direct inundation at the full reservoir level, another area once under thick forest cover, had also lost its identity over the last 38 years by indirect degradation. This zone mainly falls in the confluence of tributaries, namely Neyyar and Mullayar, with the reservoir. The capacity of the reservoir was found to be reduced by during this period and the annual average loss is calculated as (0.71%), indicating the intensity of erosion from the catchment zone. In case the proposed upper dam in the reservoir comes into existence, an additional area of from the virgin forest would be submerged and more area would face degradation around the inundated zone.\\'Abstract: \\'Most techniques in statistics are used in many disciplines besides ecology and have a wide range of applications from anthropology to zoology.

This new species, Sporidesmium binserum sp. nov., a dematiaceous  hyphomycete was found on decaying leaf litter of the host plant Quercus leucotrichophora (oak). The key features of special interest that distinguish it from other morphologically similar species of Sporidesmium are macronematous, mononematous, percurrent proliferations towards the end in the flexuous multiseptate conidiophores with obtuse tip having distinctively curved, fusiform to subfusiform, 3-septate conidia, consist of 3 cells, second cell dark brown with slightly or distinctly constricted at the septa, tip cell of conidia highly curved and/or twisted, mostly flat and conic-truncated ends at base due to schizolytic secession. The conidial maturation is presumably synchronous with conidial ontogeny. Based on these features, the specimen is proposed here as a new species.

Despite the rich environmental and natural resources of India, there has been very little developmental work due to various reasons, chief of them being non-involvement by specialized technologists in the areas where they matter most. The need for a scientific policy and a planned approach is emphasized so that higher employment generation and rapid economic growth can be achieved.\\'Abstract: \\'The study was conducted in south Rajasthan to explore diversity and species composition of Odonata from January 2013 to June 2013. Odonates were sampled from 13 localities i.e., Pichola lake, Udaisagar lake, Badi lake, Ghasa lake, Menar lake, Badwai lake, Rup sagar lake, Roli todgarh Wildlife Sanctuary, Sitamata Wildlife Sanctuary, Karmoi river stream in Sitamata WLS, College campus, Rajsmand lake and Meja dam. During the study period, a total of 1,290 individuals from 8 families and 54 species were recorded. 4 families and 28 species were related to Anisoptera, while 4 families and 26 species belonged to Zygoptera. Suborder Zygoptera were represented by the families Chlorocyphidae, Coenagrionidae, Lestidae and Platycnemididae, and suborder Anisoptera by the Aeshnidae, Gomphidae, Libellulidae and Macromiidae. Libellulidae was the largest family with 24 species, while the most dominant species was Brachythemis contaminata Orthetrum chrysis and Lestes sp. were found randomly distributed in the study area, while other were aggregated and showed habitat preference.\\'during December, 2017, at Nitte University, Deralakatte, Mangalore-575018, India\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'The Indian subcontinent is considered to be the major centre of hybridization of the wild Musa progenies, as it forms the centre of secondary origin of the taxa and therefore expected to exhibit a high degree of diversity. Musa balbisiana Colla is known to be one of the wild progenitors of cultivated bananas and plantains. Knowledge of genetic variability is very important for contemplating any conservation and management programmes. Single Primer Amplification Reaction (SPAR) approach i.e., a combination of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) and directed amplification of minisatellites DNA (DAMD) markers function as important tools for analyzing genetic variation in plants. They collectively provide a comprehensive description of the nature and the extent of existing natural genetic diversity, as the primers target different regions of the genome. A total of 47 SPAR primers (RAPD-25, ISSR-12 and DAMD-10) with high reproducibility were used for analysis of intraspecific genetic variation of the 12 genotypes of M. balbisiana, which yielded 331 polymorphic bands. The RAPD, ISSR and DAMD markers revealed and of polymorphic bands respectively. The polymorphic information content (PIC) values were almost identical for each marker system while the resolving power (Rp) was found to be highest in DAMD (4.10). The dendrogram obtained showed the presence of two main clusters in all the analyses, with some genotypes (MB10-MB11 and MB5-MB7) always maintaining and manifesting their strong genetic relationship by clustering almost all the of such markers can be considered as more effective and promising tool for assessing genetic variation in other Musa species as well.\\'Abstract: \\'The Nawarangpur district, Orissa, a trop ical region with Sal mixed moist deciduous and Sal mixed dry deciduous forests, has been affected by extensive deforestation. The district was surveyed using Landsat MSS (1973), Landsat TM (1990) and IRS P6 LISS III (2004) satellite imagery. From 1973 to 1990, more than of dense forest (rate of deforestation = 3.62) and from 1990 to 2004, (rate of deforestation = 3.97) were found to have been deforested. The analysis of results identified the reduction in area of dense forest and increase of agricultural land, degraded areas of abandoned agricultural land and unproductive scrub. There is an urgent need for rational management of the remaining forest for it to be able to survive beyond next decades. From this study it can be concluded that temporal changes and the factors affecting these changes should be determined for sustainable management of natural resources.\\'Abstract: \\'In this study the regional earth system model RegCM-ES is applied over the South Asia CORDEX domain to improve the simulation of the variability of the Indian Summer Monsoon. RegCM-ES has been integrated for 30 years, from 1979 to 2008, with a spatial resolution of in the atmospheric component, in the ocean and 50 or in the two hydrological models used for this study. A new hydrological component, the Cetemps Hydrological Model (CHyM), is included in the coupled system composed by the regional climate model RegCM4 and the ocean model MITgcm. In our analysis we show how the two way feedback simulated by the coupled system largely improves the representation of intraseasonal (ISV) and interannual (IAV) modes of variability of the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR). The comparison with the Hydrological Discharge (HD) model shows large improvements in simulating the correct amount of freshwater river discharge over the Bay of Bengal (BoB), one of the fundamental factor responsible for the formation of the shallow barrier layer (BL) over the BoB. However, the improvements in river discharge do not have a clear effect on the BL due to excessive mixing in the ocean model. The improvements in the simulation of IAV are primarily due to the ability of RegCM-ES to reproduce the Intraseasonal Oscillation modes and to the complex mechanism related to the delayed response of the ISMR to the ENSO forcing. Our results highlight the very important role of fine scale feedbacks in modulating the ISMR and the internal dynamics of this phenomenon.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Most community forests in hill regions of northeast India have been managed by traditional local institutions for centuries and most of these institutions remain functional even today. Higher forest coverage on private and community lands as compared to government land indicates that traditional institutions effectively manage community forests in the region. The present study was conducted through a survey of literature and field work using participatory research tools viz., PRA exercises, group discussions and questionnaire interviews with key informants in northeast India. We categorized the institutions involved in conservation and management of forests into three major types: traditional, quasi-traditional and modern. Traditional institutions with hierarchal structure were found in all states and are intact and functional in the state of Meghalaya. Quasi-traditional institutions, a blend of traditional and modern institutions were prevalent in Nagaland while modern institutions have almost replaced traditional institutions in Mizoram. We recorded at least eleven types of community forests viz., group of village forest, village forest, restricted forest, sacred forest, clan forest, cemetery forest, regeneration forest, bamboo forest, recreation forest, village reserved forest and medicinal plantation in villages of three states. The tribal people, through long-term trial and error experiments, have developed an elaborate, functional and generally democratic system of conservation and management of forests and associated natural ecosystems. Several forest and natural resource management lessons can be learnt from the institutional structure and decision making system of the evolving and dynamic institutions of tribal communities of the region.\\'Abstract: \\' I present the results of a 2-year experiment comparing seed predation, seed germination, and seedling survivorship patterns of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata in forest fragments and continuous forest. These empirical results were compared with natural patterns of recruitment in permanent demographic plots adjacent to experimental areas. The number of naturally occurring seedlings established in demographic plots was times greater in continuous forest than it was in 1-ha or 10-ha fragments. This result mirrors the pattern of seedling establishment in experimental transects, in which seeds in fragments were times less likely to become established than those in continuous forest. Predation of experimentally sown seeds was extremely low at all sites, and is therefore not responsible for the observed pattern. Instead, reductions in seedling abundance in forest fragments are probably due to lower levels of seed germination. Forest fragments have higher air and soil temperatures, lower relative humidity, and increased leaf-litter accumulation, all of which can alter the cues used to initiate germination. While the growth of seedlings was similar in forest fragments and continuous forest, seedling survivorship in fragments was highly variable. These results suggest that altered environmental conditions may exacerbate reductions in plant recruitment resulting from modified plant-animal interactions. Strategies aimed at reducing the intensity of abiotic edge effects should therefore be incorporated into plant conservation efforts.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Dam removal has been increasingly reported globally and is becoming an important approach for river management, restoration and environmental conservation in damming rivers. However, current limited knowledge of global trends in dam removal and related research may be potentially biased in terms of the geographic distribution and organisms studied. Such bias could mislead dam removal planning and management in different areas and ecological conservation for different taxa. In this study, we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed datasets of dam removal and publications of dam removal research using bibliometric methods. A total of 1449 dam removal documents were published from 1953 to 2016. Trends, current hotspots and future directions of dam removal research were identified. The results from this study reveal that dam removal largely occurred in the North America and Europe, and most of the removed dams were small and old dams. With respect to the topic analysis, more dam removal studies should focus on the responses of a wide range of organisms, not only fish, as well as the interspecies relationships, food webs and ecosystem structures and functions. Based on our findings, we also provide some suggestions for future dam removal planning and analysis.\\'Abstract: \\'A new species of channid fish, genusChanna, is described from four specimens collected from the Brahmaputra River basin at Dibrugarh, Assam, India.

Remote sensing data provides a perspective on how ecosystems and species are being affected by the multiple disturbances. This paper presents consolidated information of earth observation based biodiversity research and conservation applications in India. Progress achieved for understanding essential biodiversity variables with reference to species populations, species traits, community composition, ecosystem function and ecosystem structure have been reviewed. Studies mostly focused on remote sensing based biodiversity indicators in understanding of land cover, forest cover, forest type, fragmentation, biological richness, carbon stocks, fires and protected area monitoring at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Fine resolution understanding with reference to vegetation structure, function, distribution of threatened, endemic and invasive species is required for effective conservation strategies. The declining trend of deforestation and effectiveness of protected area network indicates commitment towards the global conservation targets. Ensured continuity of remote sensing can support in near real monitoring of habitats and achieving conservation effectiveness.\\'Abstract: \\'Soil seed banks that persist after a fire are important in fire-prone habitats as they minimise the risk of decline or local extinction in plants, should the fire-free interval be less than the primary juvenile periods of the species. In two common woody plant genera (Acacia and Grevillea) in southeastern Australia, we examined the size and location of the residual seed bank after fire across areas of varying seedling densities at three locations in comparison to the distribution of seeds in the soil at an unburnt site. We found viable dormant seeds remaining in the soil after fire (evidence of residual soil seed bank). A significantly lower proportion of seeds remained in the top of soil than at or soil depths, independent of seedling density or plant genus. This was due to greater germination, and possibly some seed mortality, near the soil surface. Reduced germination below was probably due to the reduced efficacy of the fire cues that break seed dormancy, a declining ability of seeds to emerge successfully from such depths, and the lower abundance of seeds in the soil at such depths. The magnitude of the residual seed bank was similar across and soil depths in Acacia suaveolens. For two Grevillea species, most residual seeds were at and The residual soil seed bank in the top of soil after fire varied across sites with estimates of 0, 19 and 27% in G. speciosa and 23, 35, and 55% in A. suaveolens. At two sites, both species had similar residual seed bank sizes, while at a third, there were large differences between the species The observed patterns imply that the fire-related cues that break seed dormancy generally declined with soil depth. For Acacia, seed dormancy is broken by heat shock, a fire-cue that declines with soil depth. Some 250 species (approx 15% of the fire-prone flora) in the region are thought to have dormancy broken by heat shock. For Grevillea, where seed dormancy is broken by the interaction of smoke and heat shock, at two sites, we suggest three possibilities: (i) the smoke cue declined with soil depth; (ii) both heat and smoke are obligatory for breaking seed dormancy; or (iii) the cues may be independent and additive and below the zone of soil heating, only a proportion of available seeds had dormancy broken by smoke alone. At a third site (no residual seed bank detected) the smoke cue was predicted not to have declined with soil depth. Up to 900 species (just under half the fire-prone flora) in the study region are thought to have seed dormancy broken by the interaction of heat and smoke during the passage of a fire.\\'Abstract: \\'Common property has been theoretically linked to environmental degradation through the metaphor of tragedy of the which discounts local solutions to commons dilemmas and typically posits the need for strong states or privatization.

(an endemic Himalayan medicinal herb) collected from 11 different populations of West Himalaya using ISSR markers. Of the total 130 ISSR primers screened, only ten ISSR primers generated 94 clear and reproducible banding patterns, of which 89 bands were polymorphic. Based on the percentage of polymorphic loci gene diversity (0.198) and information index (0.329), high genetic diversity was detected at the species level. Genetic differentiation (G was also recorded as moderate level due to high gene flow among populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that most of the genetic variation resided within the populations STRUCTURE analysis revealed two ancestral groups of the species, which were further supported by neighbour-joining cluster analysis. Among the different ecological habitats, high genetic diversity in populations under open grassy land showed suitability and preferred habitat conditions. High genetic diversity within population suggests in situ and ex situ conservation of selected populations for conserving and maintaining wide genetic pool of the species.\\'orchid, Dendrobium devonianum\\'Abstract: \\'All orchids maintain an obligate relationship with mycorrhizal symbionts during seed germination. In most cases, germination-enhancing fungi have been isolated from roots of mature plants for conservation and cultivation purposes. To understand the germination biology of Dendrobium devonianum, an over-collected medicinal orchid, the seeds of D. devonianum were inoculated with a fungal strain (FDd1) isolated from naturally occurring protocorms of D. devonianum and two other germination-enhancing fungal strains (FDaI7 and FCb4) from D. aphyllum and Cymbidium mannii, respectively. The fungal strain was isolated from five protocorms of D. devonianum and identified as a species of the genus Epulorhiza. In germination trials, treatments with all of the three fungal strains showed a significant promoting effect on seed germination and protocorm formation, compared with the control treatment (no inoculation). However, FDd1 fungal strain showed the greatest effectiveness followed by FDaI7 and FCb4. For all inoculation and control treatments, seeds developed to protocorms regardless of the presence of illumination, whereas protocorms did not develop to seedlings unless illumination was provided. The results of our manipulative experiments confirmed the hypothesis that mycorrhizae associated with orchid seedlings are highly host-specific, and the degree of specificity may be life stagespecific under in vitro conditions. The specific mycorrhizal symbionts from protocorms can enhance restoration efforts and the conservation of orchids such as D. devonianum.\\'Abstract: \\'There is a growing evidence that the climate change do has implications for drought vulnerable India with studies projecting future possible reductions in monsoon related rainfall in the country. The existing drought risk mitigation and response mechanisms were looked into and gaps were identified by drawing lessons from previous disasters and response mechanisms. In absence of reliable climate predictions at the scales that make them useful for policy level planning, the emphasis was on identifying no-regret adaptation options those would reduce current vulnerabilities while mainstreaming the adaptation in the long run. The most notable climate change implications for the drought vulnerable India are the enhanced preparedness with due emphasis to the community based preparedness planning, reviewing the existing monsoon and drought prediction methodologies, and establishing drought monitoring and early warning systems in association with a matching preparedness at the input level.\\'Abstract: \\'Culture collections are valuable resources for the sustainable use of microbial diversity and its conservation.

Ethnobotanical knowledge is a fundamental repository of the values and applications of different plants. This knowledge is often related to spiritual beliefs and religious sites, where plants have been nurtured and conserved for their use in rituals and traditional practices. While this link is well known for different areas of the global south, it has hardly been investigated in relatively more secular and modernized Western contexts. Here, we use vegetation surveys and published records to examine the occurrence of ethnobotanical values at 30 Catholic shrines in Central Italy, and compare them with an equal number of control sites. We ask this: to what extent is there an association of useful plants with sacred places in Italy, as found in other cultural contexts? We show that a greater number of useful plants are found at sacred sites. While this is mainly a consequence of the higher species richness of sacred sites, an association with plants used in animal husbandry is particularly evident, and likely related to the deep historical connection between sacred places and pastoralist traditions in Central Italy. Also, we show that there are significant variations in the distribution of old trees; the largest specimens are found at the center of sacred sites, while tree size visibly decreases away from the shrines. This indicates also that individual trees have been actively managed and conserved at sacred sites, probably driven by the symbolic values that old trees frequently embody.\\'Based on Allozyme, RAPD, and Microsatellite Markers\\'Abstract: \\'The comparative assessment of genetic diversity using allozymes, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and microsatellite markers was conducted in endemic and endangered yellow catfish (Horabagrus brachysoma) sampled from three locations in Western Ghats river systems of India. Among the three markers, microsatellites show more polymorphism, having 100% polymorphic loci, whereas allozymes show the least (56%). In RAPD, 60.5% of fragments were polymorphic. Observed heterozygosity and F ST values were very high in microsatellites, compared with the other markers. Microsatellite and RAPD markers reported a higher degree of genetic differentiation than allozymes among the populations depicted by pairwise F ST/G ST, AMOVA, genetic distance, and UPGMA dendrogram. The three classes of markers demonstrated striking genetic differentiation between pairs of H. brachysoma populations. The data emphasize the need for fishery management, conservation, and rehabilitation of this species.\\'Abstract: \\'A morphometric analysis of Shanur basin has been carried out using geoprocessing techniques in GIS. These techniques are found relevant for the extraction of river basin and its drainage networks. The extracted drainage network was classified according to system of classification and it reveals that the terrain exhibits dendritic to sub-dendritic drainage pattern. Hence, from the study, it is concluded that remote sensing data data of resolution) coupled with geoprocessing techniques prove to be a competent tool used in morphometric analysis and evaluation of linear, slope, areal and relief aspects of morphometric parameters. The combined outcomes have established the topographical even recent developmental situations in basin. It will also change the setup of the region. It therefore needs to analyze high level parameters of drainage and environment for suitable planning and management of water resource developmental plan and land resource development plan. The Shanur drainage basin is sprawled over an area of The slope of the basin varies from 1 to and the slope variation is chiefly controlled by the local geology and erosion cycles. The main stream length ratio of the basin is 14.92 indicating that the study area is elongated with moderate relief and steep slopes. The morphometric parameters of the stream have been analyzed and calculated by applying standard methods and techniques viz. Horton (Trans Am Geophys Union 1945), Miller (A quantitative geomorphologic study of drainage basin characteristics in the clinch mountain area, Virginia and Tennessee Columbia University, Department of Geology, Technical Report, No. 3, Contract N6 ONR 1953), and Strahler (Handbook of applied hydrology, McGraw Hill Book Company, New York, 1964). GIS based on analysis of all morphometric parameters and the erosional development of the area by the streams has been progressed well beyond maturity and lithology is an influence in the drainage development. These studies are very useful for planning of rainwater harvesting and watershed management.\\'Abstract: \\' Garcinia gummi-gutta (L.) Roxb. (Clusiaceae) is an endemic, semidomesticated, fruit-yielding tree species distributed in the Western Ghats of India and Sri Lanka. Various bioactive phytochemicals, such as garcinol, benzophenones and xanthones are isolated from G. gummi-gutta and have shown antibacterial, antiviral and antioxidant activities. We sequenced the total genomic DNA using Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform and examined 241,141,804 bp high quality data, assembled into 773,889 contigs. In these contigs, 27,313 simple-sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified, among which mononucleotide repeats were predominant (44.98%) followed by dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats. Primers were designed for 9964 microsatellites among which 32 randomly selected SSR primer pairs were standardized for amplification. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA in 30 G. gummi-gutta genotypes revealed polymorphic information content (PIC) across all 32 loci ranging from 0.867 to 0.951, with a mean value of 0.917. The observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.00 to 0.63 and 0.896 to 0.974, respectively. Alleles per locus ranged from 12 to 27. This is the first report on the development of genomic SSR markers in G. gummi-gutta using next-generation sequencing technology. The genomic SSR markers developed in this study will be useful in identification, mapping, diversity and breeding studies.\\'Abstract: \\'The study examines long-term land use/land cover change (LUCC) at a finer scale in a semi-arid region of India. The objectives were to study and quantify the spatiotemporal LUCC and uncover the major drivers causing the change in the Mula Pravara river basin, which is located in a semi-arid region of Maharashtra state, India. Advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR)-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 3g data for the years were used to identify the with significant positive and negative LUCC. Multi-temporal Landsat imagery was used to produce finer scale land use maps. From 1991 to 2016, the agricultural land area increased by approximately 98% due to the conversion of uncultivable and fallow lands to agriculture. The built-up area increased by 195%, and in recent years, an urban expansion has occurred in agricultural lands close to the urban fringe areas. There has been a shift from food crops to commercial crops, as observed from the steep increase in the amount of land under horticultural plantations, by 1601% from 2001 to 2016. In addition, the area under forest canopy was reduced in the protected regions. Institutional factors that improved access to water resources were the major drivers of change in hotspots, especially in the context of agriculture. Technological and economic factors were the other supporting factors that contributed to the change. This study demonstrates the advantages of using satellite remote sensing techniques to monitor the LUCC, which is useful for predicting future land changes and aids in planning adaptation strategies.\\'Abstract: \\'In recent years, the Taiwanese government has strongly promoted the concept of ecological engineering in the hope that doing so will encourage the maintenance of the ecosystem and its integrity. As a result, the riprap spur dike is one of the most commonly used measures for protecting stream banks. Traditionally, a spur dike is used at concave banks to prevent their scouring and/or to increase their stabilization. An additional benefit of deflector structures, like spur dikes, may be to increase the weighted usable area (WUA) for aquatic life survival during periods of increased flow (examples include typhoon, flood, etc.). A two-dimensional river habitat simulation program (River2D) coupled with a developed shallow water habitat type diversity module was used for the case study at a headwater stream in central Taiwan. The habitat suitability index for this study was established using substrate, depth, and velocity from field surveys for the fish family Cyprinidae by prepositioned area electrofisher. The ungauged flood conditions were calculated using digital elevation models within a watershed delineation and hydrological modeling system in accordance with local regulations. Simulated results indicate that the spur dikes currently in use on the stream in this study need be improved from a WUA point of view more effectively handle a flood event.\\'Abstract: \\'Sri Lanka is one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. This study has utilized satellite remote sensing and GIS techniques to generate a nation-wide database on forests, forest types and land use/land cover of Sri Lanka. Spatial assessment of forest cover changes was carried out for the periods and The landscape fragmentation analysis has carried out to calculate the spatial and temporal patterns of forest. Land use/land cover map was prepared representing seven classes in 2014. The plantations occupy a large area (34.2%) followed by forests (33.4%) and agriculture (26.1%) in 2014. During the period of the forest has been decreased by 5.5%. From 1976 to 1985 forest recorded a loss at an annual rate of 0.49%. This annual rate decreased to 0.01% during indicates declining trend of deforestation and effective conservation measures. The study found deforestation hotspots in south east and northern most parts of the Sri Lanka. Total number of patches estimated has increased from 15193 in 1976 to 16136 in 2014. The study has found that main causes of deforestation in Sri Lanka were due to expansion of agriculture and plantations. The extent of change detected in the study through geospatial techniques has significance to the forest ecology and management of natural landscapes in Sri Lanka.\\'Abstract: \\'Patches and their boundaries are sensitive to the scale at which they are viewed. The response of species to patchiness may depend on the resolution and on the extent by which the spatial pattern is perceived. The goal of this paper is to identify the scale at which forest spatial pattern causes changes in species richness and abundances of Dipteran and Homopteran species as a whole, and further on their distinctive ecological functional groups. Using remotely-sensed optical imagery, we described the landscape structure surrounding sampling sites. We used two approaches to deal with the problem of the scale of observation: 1) variation of extent using a multiscale analysis, and 2) comparison of two satellite sensors with different spatial resolutions (SPOT: 20 20 m, and Landsat TM: 30 30 m). The relationship between entomological data and landscape descriptors at different spatial scales was tested with the Mantel test, redundancy analysis and stepwise multiple linear regression. Relative abundances of Homopteran species were affected by landscape patterns at finer scales than in Diptera. The strength of response to landscape was different for each Dipteran functional group. The multiscale analysis also enabled the optimal scale (6.25 ha) of landscape pattern, accounting for 62% of the variation in Homopteran richness, to be identified. As a practical application, Homopteran richness was mapped by extrapolation of the regression function to the pixels of the image. Multiscale analysis provides an alternative view of fragmentation effects, which are traditionally studied through the patch-based approach, and highlights the importance of scale in ecological processes. The detection of optimal scales and the use of satellite images enable maps of important biotic indicators to be drawn up.\\'Abstract: \\'Species endemic to sky island systems are isolated to mountain peaks and high elevation plateaux both geographically and ecologically, making them particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Pressures associated with climate change have already been linked to local extinctions of montane species, emphasizing the importance of understanding the genetic diversity and population connectivity within sky islands systems for the conservation management of remaining populations. Our study focuses on the endangered alpine skink Pseudemoia cryodroma, which is endemic to the Victorian Alps in south-eastern Australia, and has a disjunct distribution in montane habitats above a.s.l. Using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite loci, we investigated species delimitation, genetic connectivity and population genetic structure across the geographic range of this species. We found discordance between genetic markers, indicating historical mtDNA introgression at one of the study sites between P. cryodroma and the closely related, syntopic P. entrecasteauxii. Molecular diversity was positively associated with site elevation and extent of suitable habitat, with inbreeding detected in three of the five populations. These results demonstrate the complex interaction between geography and habitat in shaping the population structure and genetic diversity of P. cryodroma, and highlight the importance of minimising future habitat loss and fragmentation for the long-term persistence of this species.\\'Abstract: \"This study was performed to assess how local inhabitants in two tropical watersheds value forests and perceive both forests and their own capacity to influence the hydrological cycle.

When only fleshy-fruit fall was compared, it was higher in the western lowland forest (222 DW than in any other forests DW The pulp of fleshy fruits, presumably the edible parts for frugivores, was only of the total fruit fall. The edible parts for Japanese macaques constituted of the fruit fall, showing a high value where acorns are abundant. Half of the fruit-fall biomass consisted of only one or two nonfleshy-fruited species, which are usually dominant in many other temperate forests, such as Quercus and conifers. These variations agreed with the variations in occurrence of frugivorous (such as Japanese macaques).\\'Abstract: \\'In the present study, an attempt has been made to characterize the biophysical land units in Kanholi bara river basin of sub-humid tropical ecosystem of central India using remotely sensed data, field surveys and GIS based multi-criteria overlay analysis. The geo-spatial database on elevation, slope, landforms, soil depth, soil erosion, land use/land cover and hydrogeomorphological parameters has been generated using IRS-ID LISS-III satellite data coupled with soil survey data in GIS. The methodology followed in characterization of biophysical land units in GIS includes assigning scores for different classes of the layers and weighatges for different layers based on their characteristics and degree of influence on desired output. GIS based criteria analysis reveals seventeen distinct biophysical land units in the river basin. Severe (50.5-59.5) to very severe (59.5) biophysical stress units are found in plateau spurs, isolated mounds, linear ridges, dissected plateau and escarpments. These zones are associated with severe to very severe erosion, steep to very steep, extremely shallow soils, poor to very poor groundwater prospects, wastelands and scrublands. The characterization of biophysical land units helps in analysis of their potentials, problems and stress environment to plan and execute site-specific landscape management practices and maximize the productivity from each biophysical land unit.

Opportunities for faunal exchanges with particular continents occurred in temporally distinct periods, and the presence of African, Western Eurasian, and South Asian derived taxa on the Arabian Peninsula signifies the complexity of these historical biogeographic events. The six true toad species (family Bufonidae) endemic to the Arabian Peninsula present a considerable taxonomic and biogeographic challenge because they are part of a global bufonid radiation, including several genera surrounding the Arabian Peninsula, and difficult to discriminate morphologically. As they could be derived from African, Western Eurasian, or South Asian toad groups, elucidating their evolutionary relationships has important implications for historical biogeography. Here, we analyze a global molecular data set of 243 bufonid lineages, with an emphasis on new sampling from the Horn of Africa, Western Eurasia, South Asia, and the Arabian Peninsula, to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of the Arabian species. We produce a robust time-calibrated phylogeny to infer the biogeographic history of this group on and around the Arabian Peninsula.\\'Abstract: \\'Lockie and book: Biodiversity, And Markets: Livelihoods and Agroecology in Comparative examines the relationships among this interdisciplinary trio through a variety of case studies.

They are especially dominant in lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia, but have a pan tropical distribution. Vateriopsis seychellarum is the sole representative of this family on the Seychelles. Historically one of the dominant canopy trees on extensive overexploitation of this species for its timber has led to its virtual extinction. The last individuals of this species are found in small fragmented populations at lower altitudes (up to on the island of where the total number of known reproductive adults is 112. We developed ten polymorphic microsatellite loci for this species to enable us to quantify the levels of diversity in remnant populations and to study genetic structure and contemporary gene flow. In addition we tested for cross amplification of these alleles in the closely related but geographically disjunct species Vateria indica. In Vateriopsis seychellarum the number of alleles per locus ranged from 6 to 20 (mean of 11.4 per locus) with an average polymorphic information content of 0.73 across loci. Expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.40 to 0.71 with 3 of the 10 loci showing deviation from expectations. 8 of the 10 primers showed cross amplification in Vateria indica. These markers will help to provide a better understanding of the significance of historic distributions, gene flow and recent anthropogenic habitat degradation for the survival of widespread species in recently fragmented landscapes.\\'Abstract: \\'The complete mitochondrial genome of the endangered fish Tor malabaricus, (Malabar mahseer) was sequenced for the first time. The mitochondrial genome size was determined to be in length, consisting of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNAs, 2 ribosomal RNA genes and a control region (D-loop). The overall base composition was A: 31.88%, T: 24.87%, G: 15.68% and C: 27.58%. The phylogenetic analysis of 13 protein-coding genes of available mitogenome of mahseer species showed that the T. malabaricus had closer relationship to the black mahseer T. khudree. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of T. malabaricus would contribute to the better understanding of molecular systematics, selection, conservation, species identification and evolution of this species.\\'Abstract: \"Recent reports have suggested that a global decline in amphibian populations has taken place during the past few decades.

In many countries, current water resources use already exceeds sustainable and renewable supply. Various methodologies are suggested to increase the sources of water supply, among which one of the alternatives is rainwater and runoff harvesting (ROH). Water scarcity and additional stress are among the most specific problems in arid and semi-arid regions, where vegetation cover is very weak under extensive solar irradiation effects with high evaporation rates. Present global warming, climate change impacts, and their future patterns are expected to cause increase in the evapotranspiration rates and hence reduction in the groundwater recharges. Under such circumstances, any simple but effective water storage augmentation facility as the artificial groundwater recharge gains vital importance for sustainability of water supply and survivals in desert ecosystems. Although intensive and frequent rainfall events are rare they generate significant surface water flow during occasional floods and especially flash floods with huge amounts of surface water. It is, therefore, necessary to enhance artificial groundwater recharge from consequent frequent runoffs through suitable hydraulic structures. This paper aims at assessing the importance of ROH systems for domestic supply in arid regions with specific reference to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. For this purpose, it presents ROH from the surface flows in depressions of Quaternary wadi deposits in arid and semi-arid regions.\\'Abstract: cashew plantations of south west Karnataka, India, foraging activity of 49 ants species belonging to 24 genera and 7 subfamilies were recorded. The study found that ants visited cashew trees regularly throughout the year. Myrmicinae ants were most dominant comprising 22 species followed by Formicinae with 13 species while, among Aenictinae and Dorylinae, only single species was found. Species richness was high in old cashew plantations recording of total species, while medium and young plantations recorded only 46.9 and Dominance of different ant species was noticed on cashew canopy, trunk and soil in different aged cashew plantations. Old cashew plantations were characterized by Oecophylla smaragdina, followed by Anoplolepis gracillipes, while, Camponotus compressus and C. sericeus were dominant in young and medium aged plantations. Pit fall trap collection consisted mostly of Odontomachus haematodus, Lophomyrmex quadrispinosus, Technomyrmex albipes, Myrmicaria brunnea, Diacamma sp., C. compressus and C. sericeus. During flowering and fruiting period of cashew, foraging of up to 10 ant species was seen on the same tree at a time. Activities of most ant species were predominant during winter and summer which coincides with flowering and fruiting period of cashew while during heavy down pour of south west monsoon, activities of only 10 species were seen. A significant positive correlation was found between number of ant species and maximum air temperature (0.842) and also with afternoon soil temperature (0.925).\\'Abstract: \\'Two maps covering Bangalore and its environs published in 1945 mention a network of Karez in the northern parts of the present Bengaluru city.

This paper analyses the network of Karez marked on these maps spread across the topography of north Bangalore using geo-spatial data (satellite images), ground validation, historical records (maps, gazetteers, reports and books). It (1) identifies remnants and traces of this network, (2) analyses whether they were built based on the principles of Karez, (3) discusses circumstances when these were built, and finally (4) conjectures the reason for this network to be called as in these maps.\\'Abstract: \\'Saraca asoca (Roxb.) De Wilde is an important medicinal plant from the Western Ghats of India, traditionally used in treatment of various gynecological disorders. Increasing commercial demand and decreasing numbers has resulted in this plant becoming endangered with crude drug materials being extensively substituted/adulterated with other plant species. The present study was undertaken with the objective of development and evaluation of multivariate cluster analysis of ISSR fingerprints against rbcL-based DNA barcodes as tool to understand the relationships and to differentiate common adulterants and substituents from S. asoca. ISSR-based Hierarchical Cluster Analysis was carried out on 41 samples of S. asoca and 5 each of the 5 common substituent/adulterant plants and the clustering patterns were evaluated against DNA-sequence-based barcoding of rbcL region of their plastids. Factorial analysis and Principal Coordinate Analysis revealed distinct groups of genetic pools of respective taxa thereby confirming the utility of ISSR fingerprinting as a useful tool for differentiation between the genuine and the adulterants/substituents. NCBI-BLAST search on DNA barcode rbcL region confirmed the results of ISSR assays. Therefore, our study demonstrated the utility of simple, cost-effective method of ISSR fingerprinting coupled with rbcL barcoding in differentiating this important medicinal plant from its common adulterants/substituents.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Landscape ecologists typically identify boundaries to demarcate habitatpatches. The boundary between two habitat types may be abrupt, such as thetransition between a grassland and a parking lot, or more gradual, such as theshift between successional forest stages. Two key aspects of landscapeboundaries, their shape and contrast, are predicted to influence movement ofmaterials, plants, and animals. Ecological theory suggests that a ratio should strongly influence animal emigration when patchboundaries are relatively permeable, but not when boundaries are more severe.Weinvestigated the interactive effects of patch shape and boundary contrast onmovement of ground-dwelling beetles (Carabidae and Tenebrionidae) in nativegrassland habitat at Jepson Prairie, Solano County, California, USA. Weconducted a field experiment with two patch shape treatments, square andrectangle, that held patch area constant, and two boundary contrast treatmentscreated by mowing grass surrounding each plot at two different heights. Wemonitored the number of beetles leaving each patch over a three-week periodfollowing treatment establishment. We observed a significant effect of boundarycontrast on net movement of beetles, with low contrast boundaries exhibitingnetimmigration and high contrast boundaries experiencing net emigration. Moreover,the importance of patch shape appeared to be greater for low contrast versushigh contrast boundaries, consistent with theoretical expectations. Ourcombinedobservations indicate that these ground-dwelling beetles were more likely tomove into patches that were rectangular and surrounded by a low contrast matrixthan patches that were square or surrounded by a high contrast matrix. Weconclude that net movement of beetles across patch boundaries is stronglyinfluenced by boundary contrast and may be affected by patch shape whenboundarycontrast is low.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availablenigricollaris (Teleostei: Horabagridae)\\'Abstract: \\'Random-amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and microsatellite markers were developed and used for the analysis of genetic variability in the critically endangered yellow catfish Horabagrus nigricollaris, sampled from the Chalakkudy River, Kerala, India. Eight RAPD and five microsatellite markers were detected to genotype the species. In RAPD, the 73 fragments were 20.55% polymorphic, whereas 4 polymorphic loci (80%) were obtained in microsatellites. In microsatellites, the number of alleles across the 5 loci was and the range of heterozygosity was The mean observed number of alleles was 2.4, and the effective number was 1.775 per locus. The average heterozygosity across all investigated samples was 0.29, indicating a significant deficiency of heterozygotes in this species. RAPD and microsatellite methods report a low degree of gene diversity and lack of genetic heterogeneity in the population of H. nigricollaris, emphasizing the need for fishery management, conservation, and rehabilitation of this species.\\'Abstract: \\'This study explored local controls relating to trees and spacesof the local environment in Nyamaropa Communal Lands in theNyanga District of eastern Zimbabwe.

Special emphasis waslaid on emotional and ethical investment in the abovecomponents of the environment trees and spaces. The studyemployed intensive informal and group interviews. Results showthat there is tremendous emotional and ethical investment intrees and spaces of the environment in Nyamaropa. Emotions comein a variety of forms: fear, shunning, love, reverence, andconfidence and security enhancement. The emotional and ethicalnorms are designed to govern behavior and the context of resourceutilization. These norms have implications on the organization ofspaces of the local environment and regimes of resource utilizationoccurring in them. Location of resources in spaces of the environmenthas implications on the management of resources within them. Thedomains of human habitation home bases and home fields werefound to be the most emotionally laden spaces with trees in thembeing actively planted, nurtured, conserved, eliminated, or destroyedon the basis of certain emotions and norms. The findings of the studyhave implications within the framework of decentralization and ofdemocratization of natural resource management.\\'set\\'Abstract: \\'Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) is the largest and the most diverse mountain region in the world that provides ecosystem services to one fifth of the total world population. The forests are fragmented to different degrees due to expansion and intensification of human land use. However, the quantitative relationship between fragmentation and demography has not been established before for HKH along elevation gradient. We used the globally available tree canopy cover data derived from Landsat-TM satellite to find out the decadal forest cover change over 2000 to 2010 and their corresponding fragmentation levels. Using SRTM-derived DEM, we observed high forest cover loss up to 2400 m that highly corroborated with the population distribution pattern as derived from satellite observation. In general, forest cover loss was found to be higher in south-eastern part of HKH. Forest fragmentation obtained using mean radius of as indicator, was found to be very high up to 2400 m that also corroborated with high human population for the year 2000 and 2010. We observed logarithmic decrease in fragmentation change (area-weighted mean radius of gyration value), forest cover loss and population growth during 2000-2010 along the elevation gradient with very high R2 values (i.e., 0.889, 0.895, 0.944 respectively). Our finding on the pattern of forest fragmentation and human population across the elevation gradient in HKH region will have policy level implication for different nations and would help in characterizing hotspots of change. Availability of free satellite derived data products on forest cover and DEM, grid-data on demography, and utility of geospatial tools helped in quick evaluation of the forest fragmentation vis-a-vis human impact pattern along the elevation gradient in HKH.\\'Abstract: \\'Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllusLam.) Diversity in Bangladesh: Land Use and Artificial Selection. Bangladesh is often recognized as a secondary center of diversity for jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.) and is expected to harbor important genetic diversity of this underutilized tree crop. Unfortunately, genetic erosion is occurring before this rich local resource has been documented and utilized for potential crop improvement. The aim of this study was to carry out a village-based survey and make morphological measurements to document and assess jackfruit diversity across trees associated with a gradient of three locations/habitats (homesteads, public lands, and forest or fallow lands). We also tested the hypotheses that cultivated jackfruit found in homesteads exhibited positive selection pressure for characteristics desirable in the market, and that the tree location reflected its history of origin and human selection. This was accomplished using 28 standardized morphological descriptors and represents the first large-scale assessment (900 trees) of jackfruit diversity in multiple locations (nine villages). Among the descriptors studied, those most closely associated with jackfruit marketability showed a trend for selection among the trees located in homesteads. Both fruits and leaves were larger in plants on homesteads compared to plants in forest/fallow lands, and fruit quality was significantly higher in homestead trees compared to the other two location categories. However, 18.7% and 23.7% of the fruits found on public lands and forest/fallow lands, respectively, were still considered to be of excellent fruit quality and tree vigor was significantly higher in jackfruit in forest/fallow lands compared to the other location categories. The combination of high tree vigor and presence of excellent fruit quality among jackfruit in forest/fallow lands suggests that the Bangladeshi jackfruit germplasm, which is considered inferior for market and is being negatively impacted, has valuable genetic diversity to contribute to jackfruit cultivation. Furthermore, sampling across a gradient of habitats may enable the detection of possible trends resulting from domestication pressures.\\'Abstract: \\'Dendrocalamus hamiltonii is a commercially important bamboo species of India, experiencing population depletion due to heavy extraction from natural forests. Nuclear simple sequence repeats (nSSRs) were used to study the genetic diversity and population genetic structure of 19 natural stands of D. hamiltonii distributed across the northeast Himalayas. A total of 68 nSSR primer pairs of D. latiflorus and Bambusa arundinacea have been tested in D. hamiltonii for their transferability, out of which 17 primers showing positive and polymorphic amplification were used for genotyping. A total of 130 alleles were generated in 535 individuals of all the populations using selected primer pairs. The marker analysis indicated that D. hamiltonii populations have maintained a low level of genetic diversity in northeastern region of India. Despite a large proportion of the genetic variation (83.47%) confined within the populations, a moderate level of genetic differentiation was observed among the populations. The clustering pattern obtained in UPGMA and STRUCTURE analysis revealed that most of the populations were clustered in accordance with their geographical distribution. Two populations (DH03 and DH13) exhibiting significant genetic admixture were identified and recommended for in situ conservation. In addition, six highly diverse populations were also suggested for conservation in different geographical area under study. The study has revealed useful nSSR markers for D. hamiltonii, which were lacking earlier and the information generated herein is of paramount importance in devising programs for species conservation and genetic improvement.\\'Abstract: \\'Soil erosion is one of the serious issues threatening the environment. This degrading phenomenon deteriorates the soil fertility and drastically affects the agricultural practices. As a consequence, the productivity of soil is affected unquestionably. In this regard, there is a need to take up conservation and management measures which can be applied to check further soil erosion. Even though, soil erosion is a mass process spread across the watershed, it is not economically viable to implement conservation techniques to the entire watershed. However, a method is a pre-requisite to identify the most vulnerable areas and quantify the soil erosion. In this context, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) has been adopted to estimate soil erosion in the semi-arid Andipatti Watershed of Tamil Nadu, India. This model takes into consideration the parameters including runoff-rainfall erosivity factor (R), soil erodability Factor (K), topographic factor (LS), cropping management factor (C), and support practice factor (P). All these layers are prepared in a geographical information system (GIS) platform using various data sources and data preparation methods. The results of the study indicate that the annual average soil loss within the watershed is about (metric ton per hectare per year). Higher soil erosion is observed in the landuse classes of gullied wasteland, open scrub forest and degraded plantation. The soil erosion risk is extremely higher on the steep slopes and adjoining foot hills. Based on the average soil erosion values of different landuse classes and characteristics of land, a proposed landuse map was prepared. The estimated soil erosion and the proposed landuse map could be an effective input for drawing sustainable watershed development measures.\\'Abstract: \\' Shade coffee agroforestry systems have the potential to support biodiversity. Sustainable certification of coffee has been promoted as a means to provide incentives to maintain these systems, but as yet there is little evidence if this is effective. We analyzed tree diversity on smallholder organic and conventional farms in buffer zones of three conservation areas in Costa Rica, Guatemala and Nicaragua (the later included some large-scale conventional and Rainforest Alliance certified farms). Organic farms had greater farm level tree species richness and Shannon diversity compared to conventional farms; estimated native tree species richness across the landscape was probably greater on organic farms than conventional in Nicaragua (48 vs. 28 species respectively) and possibly in Guatemala (23 vs. 15 species respectively). Organic farms had higher shade levels and more tree strata than conventional farms. In Guatemala and Nicaragua tree species composition was not closely related to whether farms were organic or conventional, although within composition clusters, organic farms tended to have greater diversity. In contrast, organic and conventional farms in Costa Rica mostly belonged to different tree species clusters. In Nicaragua most large-scale farms, and all Rainforest certified farms, formed a distinct species composition cluster with presence of old-growth forest species and within which Rainforest farms had greater diversity. Tree species composition of the shade seems to be mainly due to management history; but certification effectively differentiates those farms with greater tree diversity. Longer-term monitoring is required to determine whether certification can be an incentive to conserve or expand biodiverse coffee agroforestry systems within the buffer zones around conservation areas.\\'Abstract: \\'Changes in species composition and density of trees >10 cm gbh in a tropical dry evergreen forest in Puthupet, south India are interpreted for the period between 1992 and 2002. A 1-ha plot was inventoried in 1992 and was recensused in 2002. During the 10-year interval tree taxa diversity as well as stand density increased, but the basal area value decreased. Tree species richness increased by 21% (from 24 to 29 species) by an addition of eight species and local extinction of three species. The tree density increased just by eight individuals (from 1330 stems in 1992 to 1338 in 2002), but the basal area decreased by 8% (from 37.5 to 34.5 m2 Many species (11 numbers) have increased in abundance rather than decreased. Many surviving species seem to have considerable stability in abundance at the local scale. The density of smaller stems (10 29 cm gbh) increased by 15.3%, while that of the larger trees decreased drastically (81.6%). Ninety percent of the missing stems were from the middlestorey of the forest. Tree density changes among the three ecological guilds revealed a decrease in stem density and an increase in basal area in the lowerstorey; while the middlestorey exhibited a reverse trend. Family-wise, tree density changes revealed that the majority of families (67%) showed an increase in stem density. Long-term studies on tree population changes are essential to estimate tree mortality and recruitment rates, which will provide a greater insight in tropical forest dynamics.\\'Abstract: \\'Given the heavy reliance placed on and investment in protected areas for biological conservation, there has been much debate as to how effective these are in representing biodiversity features within their boundaries. The majority of studies addressing this issue have been conducted on a regional or national basis, precluding a broad picture of patterns of representation at the species level. We present a global assessment of the representation of the terrestrial geographic ranges of complete taxonomic groups: all known extant amphibians, birds and mammals (20,736 species) within the current global system of protected areas. We conclude that it is necessary substantially to improve the levels of coverage of the geographic ranges of the majority of species, even the widespread ones. This is particularly true for rare species, which might be assumed to be foci for protected area systems. To improve on the low levels of coverage of vertebrate ranges attained by the existing areas, key regions should be targeted, but heavy reliance will also have to be placed on approaches to sustaining populations in the wider, unprotected landscape.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Indian village ecosystems are diverse with respect to population pressures, agricultural activities and production, livestock composition, energy sources, economics and infrastructural capabilities. Natural resource degradation is a major global concern and the factors and processes leading to degradation are regional and scale up from the micro levels such as village ecosystems. There is need for integrated multidisciplinary approaches for monitoring the resource status and environmental issues at the decentralized level. This paper presents an approach to assess village ecosystems using a set of key indicators developed and tested across fourteen diverse village ecosystems of the Southern India. The concept of ecosystem services associated with village ecosystems of India has been described and adopted to identify indicators and assess issues and trends. Comparison across villages has been demonstrated and the indicators successfully reflected the key environmental issues at each village level as well as differences across villages. We also report unique cases of stabilized land use and trends from village ecosystem studied.\\'Abstract: \\'Water quality survey was undertaken to study the current status of water quality of some lentic habitats of Dharwad, Haveri and Uttar Kannada districts, to provide a baseline data, comprising study of their main physical and chemical characteristics and also to evaluate the recent limnological changes those have occurred over a time period in some lentic habitats. Trophic status was also analysed. Present study reveals that Unkal lake, and B.K. Shigigatti tank of Dharwad district, Timmapur, Hosalli, and Krishnapur tanks of Haveri district are fast progressing towards hypereutrophication. Of the other tanks, Galgi tank of Dharwad district, Gudgur, Hanamapur, Medleri, and Kadkol tanks of Haveri district have reached the eutrophic stage. The anthropogenic activities, sewage and fertilizers used in agricultural fields appear to be the major causes of the eutrophication in these tanks. If the habitats have to be preserved for their intended use, sustainable and holistic management measures for the remediation of the tanks are an immediate necessity.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availabletechnique\\'Abstract: \\'Influence of structural and lithological controls of various drainage patterns and their stream orientations (for 2nd, 3rd and 4th order steams) were identified to evaluate the direction and controlling factors of drainage network. To investigate the prospect of groundwater, hydrogeomorphological features of river basin viz. Mulki-Pavanje were identified and mapped. To evaluate the characteristics of the basin, different morphometric parameters (linear, areal and relief) were computed in sub-basin wise (SB-I to -VII). The linear parameters suggest drainage network is controlled by geomorphology. The form factor (F f), elongation ratio (R e) and circularity ratio (R c) suggest that the basin is in an elongated shape. The drainage density (D d) indicates resistant/permeable strata under medium-dense vegetation with moderate relief. The areal parameters of the sub-basins (except SBI and III) indicates moderate ground-slopes associated with moderately permeable rocks, which promote moderate run-off and infiltration. Drainage texture (T) of the whole basin indicates coarse texture while the SB-I, and III showing an intermediate texture. The relief parameters namely ruggedness number (R  n ) infers low basin relief and poor drainage density. To identify the most deficit/surplus zones of groundwater suitable weightages were assigned to the hydrogeomorphological units and morphometric parameters. The study reveal that the basin manifest that SB-III shall be most deficit zone of groundwater, whereas SB-VII, VI and V are found to show increase in groundwater potentiality. Groundwater prospect area in this basin is estimated to be 7% area under poor, 44% area under moderate and 49% area under good to excellent. This paper demonstrated the potential application of geographical information system (GIS) techniques to evaluate the groundwater prospect in absence of traditional groundwater monitoring data.\\'Abstract: \\'Adinandra belukar is a species-poor forest dominated by Adinandra dumosa (Theaceae) found in Singapore and southern Peninsular Malaysia. It is the product of secondary succession after exhaustive agricultural exploitation on land cleared of primary lowland rain forest. A high degree of similarity in vegetation between different sites was found for seven 225 m2 plots in a dinandra belukar in Singapore. Adinandra dumosa was dominant or codominant in all plots, generally found in association with the woody species Dillenia suffruticosa, Fagraea fragrans, and Rhodamnia cinerea, the climber Gynochthodes sublanceolata, the fern Dicranopteris linearis and the terrestrial orchid Bromheadia finlaysoniana. All sites had extremely acidic (pH surface cm) mineral soils with very low total nitrogen and total phosphorus g-1) contents and very high carbon/nitrogen ratios Adinandra belukar is interpreted as a heath forest because of its floristic and physiognomic similarities with this forest formation.\\'Abstract: \\'Trichopus zeylanicus subsp. travancoricus (known as Arogyapacha), an endangered ethnomedicinal plant of the Western Ghats of South India, serves as the major source of the commercial drug Jeevani. The present study established a long-term high frequency in vitro propagation protocol for Arogyapacha. Callus obtained from the explants cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid upon subculture to medium with different concentrations of 6-benzyladenine (BA) either alone or in combination with an auxin favoured shoot morphogenesis. Medium with BA alone facilitated high frequency shoot bud (mean of 93.2) formation. Medium with lower concentrations of BA (4.4, 6.6 and alone or in combination with lower concentration of acid (NAA) or indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) favoured better shoot growth than BA containing medium, but with reduced number of shoot buds. Subsequent cultures on medium with lower concentrations of BA and also on MS basal media facilitated shoot formation as well as growth of shoots. The shoot regeneration potential showed no decline up to Culture of the in vitro-derived whole explants on MS basal medium developed shoots directly from the node. On medium with IBA, the whole explants induced nodular callus from the node, which developed shoots later. Subsequent cultures on medium with BA exhibited high frequency shoot formation. The transfer of shoots after culture on half-strength MS medium containing NAA to half-strength basal medium induced a mean of 11.3 roots. Field survival of plantlets relied on the soil mix: a 1:4 ratio of sand and red-soil exhibited the highest plantlets survival (86.6%). RAPD profile of the source plant and plants regenerated from calli after showed no polymorphism. The established plantlets with morpho-floral features similar to that of the source plants flowered normally and set fruits.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableGIS-based weighted overlay analysis\\'Abstract: \\'The present study investigates the groundwater recharge potential zone and suitable sites for artificial recharge structures in the River Vaigai upper basin, Theni district, Tamil Nadu, using GIS-based multi-parameter weighted overlay method. The study area experiences severe groundwater scarcity despite having high rainfall and runoff. Therefore, an integrated remote sensing and GIS technique is used to assess the permeability and infiltration characteristics of the area and demarcate the recharge potential zones. The recharge potential zones and site-specific artificial recharge structures have been demarcated based on the weights of multiple parameters based on their permeability and infiltration capacity to groundwater recharge. The groundwater recharge potential map shows the twenty suitable sites for artificial recharge structures such as percolation ponds, loose rock check dams, and water absorption trench (WAT) in various parts of the study area. The effective recharge practices such as percolation ponds and check dams are highly suitable for gentle-sloped barren and agricultural plains in the northwestern and northeastern parts. Whereas, the barren valley fill, bajada and streams intersecting lineaments along the middle-eastern and central part are suitable for constructing WAT and check dams. These water-harvesting features can improve the groundwater scenario of the study area and groundwater augmentation is possible in future with the help of advanced techniques like remote sensing and GIS.\\'Abstract: \"I believe that the KSSP\\'s claim that all technological issues should be evaluated and assessed only in the context of their impact on the people are borne out by the case studies. Apart from the Silent Valley and the Mothi Chemicals controversies, the KSSP had a positive role to play in other technological and environmental controversies, such as those over river pollution from untreated chemical effluent being dumped in several rivers of the State by chemical and paper companies, nuclear power plant siting, and drug policy. The KSSP\\'s position paper on industries indicates that Kerala has a high concentration of chemical industries, and urges the government to issue no more new licenses for chemical companies. Instead they urge the government to bring in more engineering and electonics industries into the State.

The Uttar Pradesh populations represented the wides range of diversity for most of the traits; the populations from Assam possessed high root yield potential. In other states, too, variation was evident. On the basis of variation pattern, areas in the Indian subcontinent were identified for collection and conservation of Rauvolfia germplasm.\\'Abstract: \\'Observed summer rainfall in Myanmar for the period was used to investigate the interannual variability of summer monsoon rainfall over Myanmar. Empirical orthogonal function, the sequential Mann-Kendall test, power spectrum analysis, and singular value decomposition (SVD) were deployed in the study. Results from spectral analysis showed that the variability of rainfall over Myanmar exhibits a 2- to 6-year cycle. An abrupt change in rainfall over the country was noted in 1992. There was a notable increasing rainfall trend from 1989. After the sudden change, the mean rainfall increased by compared with the mean rainfall before the sudden change, and was associated with a rise in temperature of about An increase in heavy rainfall days was observed from the early 1990s to 2010. IOD and ENSO play an important role in the interannual variability of the summer rainfall over Myanmar. The covariability between rainfall over Myanmar and Indian Ocean SST generally suggests that a positive IOD mode is associated with suppressed rainfall in the central and northern parts of Myanmar. During a negative IOD mode, nearly the whole Myanmar experiences enhanced rainfall, which is associated with devastating socioeconomic impacts. The covariability between the rainfall over Myanmar and the sea surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean in the first and second SVD modes was dominated by warming in the east and central El in dry conditions in central Myanmar.\\'Abstract: \\'We studied the regeneration of tree species in the sub-tropical forest of Alaknanda Valley in Garhwal Himalaya, India. The overall regeneration status was fairly good in the study area. Seedling density ranged between 520 and 1,240 seedlings per ha while the density of saplings varied between 400 and 800 saplings per ha. Out of eight sites studied, five sites, viz., A1, A2, B1, B2 and C2 contained the highest number of seedlings per ha) and saplings per ha) for Pinus roxburghii and remaining three sites viz., C1, D1 and D2 represented the highest number of seedlings per ha) and saplings per ha) for Anogeissus latifolius. The DBH class distribution of the tree species revealed that the highest number of individuals was concentrated in the lower diameter classes while smallest numbers were found in the higher diameter classes. Species such as Acacia catechu, Anogeissus latifolius, Dalbergia sissoo, Engelhardtia spicata, Lannea coromandelica, Mallotus philippensis and Pinus roxburghii have the largest number of saplings and seedlings in the lower DBH classes, suggesting that they have good regeneration potential. Other species such as Aegle marmelos, Bauhinia variegata, Bombax ceiba, Cassia fistula, Erythrina variegata, Haldinia cordifolia, Mangifera indica, Ougeinia oojeinensis, Phyllanthus emblica, Syzygium cumini, Terminalia alata and Toon a hexandra have either no or very small number of saplings in the lower DBH classes, which indicates that the status of these species implies poor regeneration.\\'Abstract: \\'Despite a global trend toward settlement, the incidence of pastoral nomadism is on the rise in the Marwar region of Rajasthan, India. Typical explanations for this change use models of population pressure; increasing herds and decreasing pasture are held to blame. This explanation, however intuitive, is unsatisfactory. Instead, changing institutional and economic patterns are creating new contexts for strategic movement. Bottlenecks in the yearly resource calendar, caused by the disintegration of obligatory social relationships, force migrations during periods of scarcity. Changes in the volume and pattern of the meat and wool markets have also created opportunities for migrating pastoralists. Producers increase their access to markets and the reproductive rate of their herd through long, annual, migration. While nomadism is a general adaptation to changes in the socioeconomic conditions of the region, differential resource endowments account for the range of strategies; wealthy herders have opportunities not enjoyed by more marginal producers.\\'Abstract: \\'NORMAN MYERS: An honorary visiting fellow at Green College. He is an independent scientist and consultant working in environment and development.Like most other environmental and economic sectors, forestry worldwide looks set to encounter a growing number of surprises in the sense of major divergencies from established trends. These surprises will be largely environmental or economic or both at once. Unless we do a better job of identifying them ahead of time, these surprises will often be of a scale to overwhelm our anticipatory and preventive capacities. Indeed and as this paper demonstrates, the most likely as well as the most taxing forestry problems of the future will often be the ones we have scarcely thought of. Fortunately, the same applies to forestry opportunities. In these circumstances, there is a premium on not only supplying answers to recognized questions but on raising entirely new questions.\\'Abstract: \\'The present study highlights the application of satellite remote sensing in the assessment and monitoring of the mangrove forests along the coastline in Goa state of India. Based on onscreen visual interpretation techniques various land use and land cover classes have been mapped and classified. An attempt has been made to analyse changes in the mangrove forest cover from 1994 to 2001 using IRS-1B LISS-II and IRS-1D LISS-III data. An increase in the mangrove vegetation in the important estuaries has been found during 1994 and 2001. During this period, the mangrove forest increased by 44.90 per cent as a result of increased protection and consequent regeneration. Plantation of mangrove species has been raised in 876 ha (1985 to 1997) by the State ForestAbstract: \\'A key step towards the restoration of heavily disturbed fragile coastal wetland ecosystems is determining the composition and characteristics of the plant communities involved. This study determined and characterized the community of higher plants in the Chenier wetland of Bohai Bay using a combination of field surveys, quadrat approaches, and multivariate statistical analyses. This community was then compared to other adjacent wetlands (Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Laizhouwan, Jiaozhouwan, and Yellow River Delta wetland) located near the Huanghai and Bohai Seas using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Results showed a total of 56 higher plant species belonging to 52 genera from 20 families in Chenier wetland, the majority of which were dicotyledons. Single-species families were predominant, while larger families, including Gramineae, Compositae, Leguminosae, and Chenopodiaceae contained a higher number of species species). Cosmopolitan species were also dominant with apparent intrazonality. Abundance (number of species) of temperate species was twice that of tropical taxa. Species number of perennial herbs, such as Gramineae and Compositae, was generally higher. Plant diversity in the Chenier wetland, based on the Shannon-Wiener index, was observed to be between the Qinhuangdao and Laizhouwan indices, while no significant difference was found in other wetlands using the Simpson index. Despite these slight differences in diversity, PCoA based on species abundance and composition of the wetland flora suggest that the Bohai Chenier community was highly similar to the coastal wetlands in Tianjin and Laizhouwan, further suggesting that these two wetlands could be important breeding grounds and resources for the restoration of the plant ecosystem in the Chenier wetland.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'\\'plant\\'Abstract: \\' Saraca asoca (Roxb.) Willd, commonly known as or is one of the most important medicinal plants used in raw herbal trade in India. The bark extracts of the tree are used in the treatment of leucorrhea and other uterine disorders besides also having anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-pyretic, anti-helminthic, and analgesic activity. The indiscriminate and rampant extraction of the wood to meet the ever-increasing market demand has led to a sharp decline in naturally occurring populations of the species in the country. Consequently, the species has recently been classified as by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Increasing deforestation and increasing demand for this medicinal plant have resulted in a limited supply and suspected widespread adulteration of the species in the raw herbal trade market. Adulteration is a serious concern due to: (i) reduction in the efficacy of this traditional medicine, (ii) considerable health risk to consumers, and (iii) fraudulent product substitution that impacts the economy for the Natural Health Product (NHP) Industry and consumers. In this paper, we provide the first attempt to assess the extent of adulteration in the raw herbal trade of S. asoca using DNA barcoding validated by NMR spectroscopic techniques. Analyzing market samples drawn from 25 shops, mostly from peninsular India, we show that more than of the samples were spurious, representing plant material from at least 7 different families. This is the first comprehensive and large-scale study to demonstrate the widespread adulteration of market samples of S. asoca in India. These results pose grave implications for the use of raw herbal drugs, such as that of S. asoca, on consumer health and safety. Based on these findings, we argue for a strong and robust regulatory framework to be put in place, which would ensure the quality of raw herbal trade products and reassure consumer confidence in indigenous medicinal systems.\\'Abstract: \\'Soil erosion and water conservation are major concerns arising from agricultural acceleration, changing land patterns and uncertain rainfall pattern. Soil erosion within watersheds results in increasing the deposition of sedimentation in the water bodies and thus dropping their carrying capacity and life span. Soil erosion studies are crucial for watershed design and management. The objective of current investigation is to quantify sediment yield of Upper Karha watershed of Pune district, Maharashtra, India, which is a semi-arid zone and rain-shadow region. In the present study, the sediment yield assessment by USLE model and RUSLE model is performed with the help of remote sensing and geographical information system. The average annual sediment yield is observed, i.e. and by USLE and RUSLE models, respectively. To address the current issue of sedimentation, suitable sites and suitable types of structures were suggested for soil and water conservation.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'This study was carried out to simulate the forest cover changes in India using Land Change Modeler. Classified multi-temporal long-term forest cover data was used to generate the forest covers of 1880 and 2025. The spatial data were overlaid with variables such as the proximity to roads, settlements, water bodies, elevation and slope to determine the relationship between forest cover change and explanatory variables. The predicted forest cover in 1880 indicates an area of 10,42,008 km2, which represents 31.7% of the geographical area of India. About 40% of the forest cover in India was lost during the time interval of Ownership of majority of forest lands by non-governmental agencies and large scale shifting cultivation are responsible for higher deforestation rates in the Northeastern states. The six states of the Northeast (Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura) and one union territory (Andaman & Nicobar Islands) had shown an annual gross rate of deforestation of >0.3 from 2005 to 2013 and has been considered in the present study for the prediction of future forest cover in 2025. The modelling results predicted widespread deforestation in Northeast India and in Andaman & Nicobar Islands and hence is likely to affect the remaining forests significantly before 2025. The multi-layer perceptron neural network has predicted the forest cover for the period of 1880 and 2025 with a Kappa statistic of >0.70. The model predicted a further decrease of 2305 km2 of forest area in the Northeast and Andaman & Nicobar Islands by 2025. The majority of the protected areas are successful in the protection of the forest cover in the Northeast due to management practices, with the exception of Manas, Sonai-Rupai, Nameri and Marat Longri. The predicted forest cover scenario for the year 2025 would provide useful inputs for effective resource management and help in biodiversity conservation and for mitigating climate change.\\'amla phyllanthus emblica, (Euphorbiaceae)\\'Abstract: \\'Sustainable extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) depends upon harvesting a small fraction of the total productivity. Over-exploitation can lead to a loss of biodiversity, but a low level of extraction, without value addition at the point of origin, is usually not economically feasible for extractors. Extraction and productivity levels per unit area for most non-timber forest products are unknown, nor do we have much information about value addition at various points in the marketing channels. Here we determine extraction and productivity levels for Amla trees (Phyllanthus emblica), which yield fruits that are used for a wide variety of purposes in preparation of various foods, beverages and medicines. We also present preliminary data on the price appreciation of the fruit for one of the processed products. We have determined that the current level of extraction, 60-80% of all fruits at the population level, may have a negative effect on new recruitment. We present a model for value addition that has the potential to enhance income and reduce the level of extraction. This model is currently being implemented by the Soliga community with the assistance of a non-governmental organization.\\'ISBN: 9789811051166\\'Abstract: \\'Wild relatives of cultivated plants are the treasure trove of genetic resources for crop improvement and dietary diversification. Especially, they are crucial for conferring diseases resistance and abiotic stress tolerance (such as drought, flood, heat-shock, salinity, etc.) in cultivated crops and thereby breeding next generation of climate smart crops (i.e. climate resilient crops) for futuristic climatic conditions. Unfortunately, most of the wild relatives of crop plants across the world are being neglected and underutilized, without recognizing its real potential. In this backdrop, the book herein review titled Relatives of Cultivated Plants in India: A Reservoir of Alternative Genetic Resources and authored by Anurudh Kumar Singh, National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, New Delhi, India is a timely and topical endeavor to provide a vivid account of more than 958 species of wild relatives of cultivated plants in India along with their occurrence, distribution, current status, as well as their future potential for breeding program and dietary diversification.

However universally acknowledged, this reality is not appreciated as much as one might imagine or hope. Having achieved a high standing in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 1992, biodiversity appears to have gradually fallen from that position in the 20 years since. This is evidenced by the fact that most discussions and actions in relation to the CBD have now shifted to sustainable development and ecosystem services (Daily 1997), instead of focusing more directly on biodiversity values themselves. One reason for this fall in status seems to be linked to issues about the actual definition of whether used in a broad sense, including the diversity of genes, species, communities and ecosystems, or more narrowly defined as the diversity of species alone. While the close link between biodiversity and is undeniable, biodiversity itself has long recognized links to human well-being, including...\\'Abstract: \\'The precautionary principle is one of the most contentious principles in contemporary international legal developments. The very fact that it is a principle of international environmental law has been questioned by many legal scholars. However, this does not take away the fact that the precautionary principle continues to be applied widely across sectors both internationally and nationally. The nature and scope of its application has varied widely according to the context and sector within which it has been applied. The central issue which this article seeks to address is the regulatory and the policy making space that is available to the Government of India in the context of the obligations as undertaken under the Cartagena Protocol and under various other international treaties. The regulatory space would also be affected by the domestic legal developments across sectors in which the principle has been applied. recent decision on the large-scale commercialisation of Bt-Cotton has already created much debate regarding its appropriateness given the realities of Indian farm practices. More specifically, it has also led to a rethinking of the role and application of the precautionary principle in addressing these realities. Considering that the Indian policy on biotechnology is currently being drafted, it is important to look into the scope of applying the precautionary principle in taking any decision on genetically modified organisms (GMO) in terms of their distribution of risks, incorporating the social and equity impacts of such decisions.\\'Abstract: \\'Cryptic species are difficult to identify using morphological identification tools. They represent hitherto unknown biodiversity and their discovery helps formulate more efficient conservation management policies. In this study we assess intraspecific diversity of Rhinolophus rouxii and investigate the presence of cryptic lineages. We characterize acoustic, morphological and genetic differences between allopatric populations of this species in Southern India. Our results reveal the presence of two distinct acoustic lineages (80 and phonic types). Forearm length also differs significantly between the two phonic types. They share a sister taxa relationship and the average genetic distance between them is over 8 %. Phylogenetic reconstruction and the associated divergence time suggest an evolutionary history that correlates with a middle Miocene separation. We propose that these two phonic types be called sibling species and evolutionarily significant units (ESU) within the subgenus Indorhinolophus. We recommend a new name, R. indorouxii for the species representing the phonic type. This study reiterates our lack of accurate taxonomic knowledge of bats, and highlights the value in combining genetics with behavioral (phonic characterization) and morphological measurements in the discovery of cryptic species.\\'Abstract: \\'Microfinance projects now seek to achieve improvement in environmental quality in addition to poverty alleviation. Achievement of these goals may depend upon the economic and environmental impact of microfinance businesses. This study is a quantitative analysis of these outcomes for Ecodevelopment, an Indian microfinance project, which aims to prevent forest degradation by poverty alleviation. The study divides businesses into perishable goods, non-perishable goods, simple skills, and special skills and measures their economic outcome by two indicators, repayment percentage and continuity of businesses. The study examines the effect of loan amount on the economic outcome of businesses. To quantify the environmental outcome, it analyzes the use of firewood or fodder and release of pollutants by businesses. The results show that loan amount does not affect the economic outcome, special skills have best performance, and skills cause less pressure on forest resources. These results suggest the need for development of knowledge-intensive skills, involvement of institutions in the operations of business, and inclusive policies for protected area management.\\'Abstract: \\'Shoreline changes on account of global climate change and sea level rise is one of the major problems along the coastlines in different continents of the world. This study was carried out along the coastlines of Andhra Pradesh state in India using multi-temporal satellite images from 1973 to 2015 period. Long-term coastal erosion and accretion rate over a period of has calculated using Digital Shoreline Analysis System and prepared shoreline maps by using GIS-Software. End point rate (EPR) statistical method is applied to estimate the shoreline change rate. Various coastal parameters like sea level rise, geomorphology, elevation and coastal slope were used to find out the interactive relationship between the physical parameters and shoreline changes in the area. The study revealed that the coastal changes are more dominant in Krishna and Godavari Deltaic plain. The average erosion and accretion rate observed in the Krishna Godavari delta was 10.63 and per year respectively. The study indicated that, climatic changes and fluvial process are playing key role in changing shoreline positions. The study exhibited that elevation and slope are played intense role in the shoreline positional change. The present study demonstrates that combined use of satellite imagery and EPR statistical method as an accurate and reliable method for shoreline change analysis.\\'Abstract: \\'The present study deals with the species abundance, diversity and species richness of avian communities in the Bangalore University Campus (BUC), Bengaluru, India. One hundred and six species of birds belonging to 42 families under 68 genera were recorded. and alpha diversities, species evenness, species richness of bird communities, number of bird species and percentage of population density of birds between various seasons in the BUC differed significantly between the study years. Of these bird species, the relative abundance and species distribution ratio (0.070) of Psittacula krameri were highest, whereas relative abundance and species distribution ratio (0.002) of Coracias benghalensis were lowest. The existing 32 species of flowering plants/trees belonging to 29 genera under 14 families in the campus are used for perching by birds. Moreover 29 species of flowering plants/trees belonging to 24 genera under 16 families depend on birds for pollination and/or seed dispersal. Occurrence of greater bird diversity and abundance of avian communities were recorded highest in the winter season in the BUC premises. In the different seasons, the BUC had varying community structure of birds between the study years. BUC suffers from numerous threats namely grass cutting, fire and grazing of domestic animals. Conservation methods needed for habitat management are restoration of vegetation and wetlands, and increase plant and tree diversity to protect the ecosystem of BUC habitat and to preserve its diversity of avifauna.\\'Abstract: \\'Analysis of information from about 287 sample plots on Northeast China Transect (NECT) indicated that between 1986 and 1994 at latitude N to N and longitude E to E, the relative abundance of different tree species changed differently. The change of relative abundance for the moisture-sensitive tree species, such as Quercus mongolica and Larix olgensis, was helpful to detect climate change. Use of GIS software and the and indices of tree diversity on NECT showed that the areas of high and medium tree diversity decreased, respectively, while the area of low tree diversity increased. The heterogeneity of habitats along the NECT increased with climate change and local human activities.\\'Abstract: \"One of the last primitive island ecosystems in the Indian Ocean has been invaded since 1969 by the Sri Lankan privet, Ligustrum robustum. L. robustum is still spreading in the forests of La Island, where only 30% of the original vegetation remains, but where 98% of the primary native vegetation of the Mascarene Islands still exists. On Mauritius, where L. robustum was introduced about 1895, it now forms dense, impenetrable thickets, and its presence has been correlated with the inability of native vegetation to re-establish. We assessed the potential impacts of L. robustum invasion on the native ecosystems of La and identified the factors of invasibility. We determined the degree of invasion in 12 plots of 156 m2 and followed native flora and privet recruitment for 3 years in 12 seedling plots of 39 m2. The data show that monocultural L. robustum stands now exist in human-disturbed primary forest patches (3.3 individuals/m2 and 80% of total individuals) and high seedling densities occur in the least disturbed patches. L. robustum\\'s rapid growth, high shade tolerance and seed production, bird-assisted seed dispersal and high seedling recruitment contribute to its invasiveness in intact forests. The conservation of the original ecosystems of La depends on the setting up of a long-term and immediate global control strategy.\"Abstract: Gujarat state has a long coastline with rich maritime history. The entrepreneurial nature of its citizens enabled Gujarat to emerge as the most aggressive industrial development state in the country. Due to the availability of vast land resource for industrial expansion along the coast, affordable labor cost, sparse human density and liberal state government policies have significantly contributed towards the outburst of the industrial growth across Gujarat. Ecologically fragile ecosystems such as mangroves, coral reefs, mudflats, salt marshes, sea grass beds and nesting sites of winter migratory birds are increasingly threatened due to direct and indirect pressure induced by the industrial and allied development projects. This article reviews the status of coastal environment in Gujarat state with an emphasis on integrated coastal management associated laws and regulations.\\'Abstract: \\'This article presents the results of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) for Bangalore, South India. Analyses have been carried out considering the seismotectonic parameters of the region covering a radius of keeping Bangalore as the center. Seismic hazard parameter has been evaluated considering the available earthquake data using (1) relationship and (2) Kijko and Sellevoll (1989, 1992) method utilizing extreme and complete catalogs. The parameter was estimated to be 0.62 to 0.98 from relation and from Kijko and Sellevoll method. The results obtained are a little higher than the values published earlier for southern India. Further, probabilistic seismic hazard analysis for Bangalore region has been carried out considering six seismogenic sources. From the analysis, mean annual rate of exceedance and cumulative probability hazard curve for peak ground acceleration (PGA) and spectral acceleration (Sa) have been generated. The quantified hazard values in terms of the rock level peak ground acceleration (PGA) are mapped for 10% probability of exceedance in on a grid size of In addition, Uniform Hazard Response Spectrum (UHRS) at rock level is also developed for the 5% damping corresponding to 10% probability of exceedance in The peak ground acceleration (PGA) value of obtained from the present investigation is slightly lower (but comparable) than the PGA values obtained from the deterministic seismic hazard analysis (DSHA) for the same area. However, the PGA value obtained in the current investigation is higher than PGA values reported in the global seismic hazard assessment program (GSHAP) maps of Bhatia et al.

Dhule district suffers from water problem, and therefore, there is no extra water available to supply for the agricultural and industrial growth. To understand the lithological characters in terms of its hydro-geological conditions, it is necessary to understand the geology of the area. It is now established fact that the geophysical method gives a better information of subsurface geology. Geophysical electrical surveys with four electrodes configuration, i.e., Wenner and Schlumberger method, were carried out at the same selected sites to observe the similarity and compared both the applications in terms of its use and handling in the field. A total 54 VES soundings were carried out spread over the Dhule district and representing different lithological units. The VES curves are drawn using inverse slope method for Wenner configuration, IPI2 win Software, and curve matching techniques were used for Schlumberger configuration. Regionwise lithologs are prepared based on the obtained resistivity and thickness for Wenner method. Regionwise curves were prepared based on resistivity layers for Schlumberger method. Comparing the two methods, it is observed that Wenner and Schlumberger methods have merits or demerits. Considering merits and demerits from the field point of view, it is suggested that Wenner inverse slope method is more handy for calculation and interpretation, but requires lateral length which is a constrain. Similarly, Schlumberger method is easy in application but unwieldy for their interpretation. The work amply proves the applicability of geophysical techniques in the water resource evaluation procedure. This technique is found to be suitable for the areas with similar geological setup elsewhere.\\'Abstract: \\'Our series of manuscripts on Threatened Fishes of the World came to an end after a prolonged and increasingly depressing and frustrating history.

Multiple shoots were initiated from axillary bud and shoot tip explants on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different concentrations and combinations of cytokinins [BA (6-benzyladenine), KN (kinetin), and TDZ (thidizauron)] along with auxins [NAA acetic acid), IAA (indole-3 acetic acid), IBA (indole-3-butyric acid)]. Maximum shoot multiplication (12.14) was achieved from axillary bud explant followed by shoot tip explant (8.85) at TDZ with NAA. A maximum of 9.71 roots/shoot was observed at IBA. The rooted plantlets successfully hardened and transferred to greenhouse condition with 83% survival. Inter-simple sequence repeat markers exhibited genetic fidelity with 100% monomorphism in regenerants. The authenticated protocol supports rapid production of true-to-type plants by liquid culture in vitro and therefore could supply a valuable target material for genetic transformation study.\\'Abstract: \\'Present study revealed the presence of 16 earthworm species belonging to 11 genera and four families viz.

While four earthworm species viz. Metaphire houlleti, Drawida assamensis, Drawida papillifer papillifer and Pontoscolex corethrurus were common to all species of bamboo plantations, the rest showed restricted distribution. Among the earthworm species 4 were exotic (Amynthus alexandri, Metaphire houlleti, Dichogaster bolaui and Pontoscolex corethrurus) and the others were native to the Indian sub-continent. In general, earthworms under the bamboo plantations occurred within temperature range of pH organic matter moisture water holding capacity and bulk density The average density and biomass of the earthworms in the studied places were and respectively. Earthworm diversity, dominance and evenness indices showed the values 1.00, 0.47 and 0.70 respectively. Earthworm density and biomass showed a negative correlation with temperature whereas those had a strong positive correlation with pH, moisture and organic matter of the soils.\\'Abstract: \\'An understanding of the rooting pattern of tree species used in agroforestry systems is essential for the development and management of systems involving them. Seasonal variation, depth wise and lateral distribution of biomass in roots of different diameter classes and their annual production were studied using sequential core sampling. The investigations were carried out in four tree species under and situations at ICAR Research Farm, Barapani (Meghalya), India. The tree species were mandarin (Citrus reticulata), alder (Alnus nepalensis), cherry (Prunus cerasoides) and albizia (Paraserianthes falcataria). The contribution of fine roots to the total root biomass ranged from 87% in albizia to 77% in mandarin. The bulk of the fine roots (38% to 47%) in the four tree species was concentrated in the upper 10 cm soil layer, but the coarse roots were concentrated in cm soil depth in alder (46%) and albizia (51%) and at cm in cherry (41%) and mandarin (48%). In all the four tree species, biomass of both fine- and coarse-roots followed a unimodal growth curve by showing a gradual increase from spring (pre-rainy) season to autumn (post rainy) season. Biomass to necromass ratio varied between 2 to 3 in the four tree species. The maximum (3.2) ratio was observed during spring and the minimum (2) in the rainy season. In alder and albizia, the fine roots were distributed only up to 1 m distance from the tree trunk but in the other two species they were found at a distance up to 1.5 m from the tree trunk. The annual fine root production varied from 3.6 Mg to 6.2 Mg and total production from 4.2 to 8.4 Mg in albizia to mandarin, respectively. Cherry and mandarin had a large number of woody roots in the surface layers which pose physical hindrance during soil working and intercultural operations under agroforestry. But the high biomass of roots of these two species may be advantageous for sequential or spatially separated agroforestry systems. However, alder and albizia have the most desirable rooting characteristics for agroforestry systems.\\'I. acuminatus Taylor, 1960, I. youngorum Taylor, 1960 and I. laosensis Taylor, 1969\\'Abstract: \\'Caecilians of the genus Ichthyophis Fitzinger, 1826 are among the most poorly known amphibian taxa within Southeast Asia. Populations of Ichthyophis from the Indochina region (comprising Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam) have been assigned to five taxa: Ichthyophis acuminatus, Ichthyophis bannanicus, Ichthyophis kohtaoensis, Ichthyophis laosensis, and Ichthyophis nguyenorum. Barcoding of recently collected specimens indicates that Indochinese congeners form a clade that includes several morphologically and genetically distinct but yet undescribed species. Although body coloration is supported by the molecular analyses as a diagnostic character at species level, unstriped forms are paraphyletic with respect to striped Ichthyophis. Based on our morphological and molecular analyses, three distinct unstriped ichthyophiid species, Ichthyophis cardamomensis sp. nov. from western Cambodia, Ichthyophis catlocensis sp. nov. from southern Vietnam, and Ichthyophis chaloensis sp. nov. from central Vietnam are described as new herein, almost doubling the number of Ichthyophis species known from the Indochinese region. All three new species differ from their unstriped congeners in a combination of morphological and molecular traits. In addition, redescriptions of three unstriped Ichthyophis species (Ichthyophis acuminatus, I. laosensis, I. youngorum) from Indochina and adjacent Thailand are provided.\\'Abstract: \\' Efficient protocols of axillary bud multiplication and indirect organogenesis were established for Holostemma ada-kodien Schult. (Asclepiadaceae). Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with N6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) induced an average of eight shoots per node and was the best for axillary bud proliferation. Subsequent cultures enhanced the number of shoots. The explant source of callus and the growth regulator inducing the callus exhibited significant influence on organogenesis. Callus developed from the basal cut end of the node explants differentiated more than 15 shoots on MS medium fortified with Callus from internode explants developed fewer shoots than callus from the basal cut ends of node explants. Leaf-derived callus did not undergo organogenesis. The abscission of leaves and shoot tips of the developed shoots was prevented by the addition of AgNO3 or CoCl2, but with a concomitant significant reduction in the number of shoots. Half-strength solid MS or liquid medium with IBA exhibited the best in vitro rooting. Ninety percent of the rooted shoots survived in the field.\\'Abstract: \\'Although Myanmar exports millions of dollars of rattan cane each year, the last systematic treatment of rattans in this country was done over 100 years ago, and virtually nothing has been written about the collection and trade of this important forest resource. Here we report the results from a study of rattans in the Hukaung Valley Tiger Reserve in northern Myanmar. A total of 15 species of rattan were encountered; seven species are new records for Myanmar and two species are new to science. Inventory transects revealed that the density of commercial rattans in local forests averages 40.5 canes long/hectare. Populations of all species appear to be actively regenerating. The current pattern of rattan exploitation, however, is largely uncontrolled and will eventually lead to resource depletion unless some form of management is implemented.\\'Abstract: \\'Despite their obvious environmental, societal and economic importance, our understanding of the causes and magnitude of the variations in the global water cycle is still unsatisfactory. Uncertainties in hydrological predictions from the current generation of models pose a serious challenge to the reliability of forecasts and projections across time and space scales. This paper provides an overview of the current issues and challenges in modelling various aspects of the hydrological cycle. These include: the global water budget and water conservation, the role of model resolution and parametrisation of precipitation-generating processes on the representation of the global and regional hydrological cycle, representation of clouds and microphysical processes, rainfall variability, the influence of coupling on rainfall patterns and their variability, monsoon processes and teleconnections, and ocean and cryosphere modelling. We conclude that continued collaborative activity in the areas of model development across timescales, process studies and climate change studies will provide better understanding of how and why the hydrological cycle may change, and better estimation of uncertainty in model projections of changes in the global water cycle.\\'Abstract: \\'Monitoring forest cover change and understanding the dynamic of forest cover is increasingly important in sustainable development and management of forest ecosystems. This paper uses remote sensing (RS) techniques to monitor forest cover change in Forest Enterprise (MSFE) located in NE of Turkey through 1975 to 2000 and then analyses spatial and temporal changes in forest cover by Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Forest cover changes were detected from a time series of satellite images of Landsat MSS in 1975, Landsat TM in 1987, and Landsat ETM+ in 2000 using RS and GIS. The results showed that total forest area, productive forest area and degraded forest area increased while broadleaf forest area and non forest area decreased. Mixed forest and degraded forest increased during the first period, but decreased during the second period. During the whole study period, the annual forestation rate was 152 ha equivalent to 0.27% using the compound-interest-rate formula. The total number of patches increased from 36,204 to 48,092 (33%), and mean size of forest patch (MPS) decreased from 2.8 ha to 2.1 ha during a 25 year period. Number of smaller patches (patches in ha size class) increased, indicating more fragmented landscape over time that might create a risk for the maintenance of biodiversity of the area. While total population increased from 1975 to 2000 (3.7%), rural population constantly decreased. The increase of forest areas may well be explained by the fact that demographic movement of rural areas concentrated City Center. These figures also indicated that decrease in the rural population might likely lead to the release of human pressure to forest areas, probably resulting in a positive development of forest areas.\\'Abstract: \\'The historical collections in herbaria are increasingly used for documentation of biodiversity. The use of herbarium reconstruction in the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot, using a case study from Srinagar city in Kashmir Himalaya has been shown. During the present investigation, a comprehensive and updated biodiversity database of 937 plant taxa has been developed, which is based on expert investigation of ca. 45,000 plant specimens deposited in the herbarium of University of Kashmir, and careful supplementation of field records in the study area made over the last one decade. The results indicate a clear dominance of herbaceous growth form as 602 species were herbs. Majority of the plant species possess perennial life span, as 610 plant species fall under this category. Inspite of being a rapidly urbanising centre, Srinagar city owing to its location in the global biodiversity hotspot of Himalayas exhibits a clear dominance of wild-growing plant species. In the database, 20 species fall under different threat categories. The present study is the documentation of plant biodiversity of this eco-fragile mountainous region and clearly demonstrates the precious value of biological collections in bridging the knowledge gaps in global biodiversity hotspots, including Himalayas. Looking ahead, the biodiversity database can serve as a baseline in the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity; and more importantly, the database can provide the reference framework in assessing and monitoring the impending impacts of land use and climate change on the biodiversity of this Himalayan city.\\'Abstract: \\'We critically discuss the impact of sustainable development initiatives in Kerala, India, on biodiversity and on women farmers in the matrilineal Adivasi community of the Kurichya-tribe in Wayanad. By contextualizing development programs regarding the specifically gendered access to land, division of labor, distribution of knowledge and decision-making power, we situate our analysis within the theoretical framework of feminist political ecology. We first outline gaining of social and political space in local self-government institutions (Panchayath) and then critically discuss the impacts of farming groups (Joint Liability Groups: JLGs). Decentralization and development programs have aimed at empowering women and reducing poverty through improved food security. However, little success has materialized, as patriarchal power structures concerning decision-making processes as well as control over the most valuable resources (land and rice) and traditional knowledge have been maintained. Whereas self-help groups (Kudumbasree) in Kerala have enhanced their position, farming groups (JLGs), by contrast, have brought little betterment. In some cases they have even downsized management and knowledge of resources related to agriculture and do not integrate or enhance Kurichya knowledge. As some women are now introducing high-yielding rice seeds and fertilizer and as it is impossible for them to control land and get access to traditional rice domain of contest the notion of women being considered the preservers of agrobiodiversity. We argue, rather, that the construction and transformation of ecological traditional knowledge is highly dependent on the gendered multi-scaled power structures of state and community.\\'Abstract: \\' The occurrence of high concentrations of fluoride in groundwater in the villages of Singhpur and Sagaragan in the Nayagarh District of Orissa and its relation with the fluoride-rich hot spring water located nearby have been studied. The composition of the hot spring water is very comparable to the other thermal waters of the world. Thermodynamic considerations show that more than 65% of the groundwater and hot spring water samples are oversaturated with calcite, and only four samples are oversaturated with fluorite. Fluoride concentration shows a positive relation to sodium, bicarbonate and pH, and a negative relation to calcium and magnesium in fluoride-rich groundwater and hot spring water. Principal component analysis shows that the fluoride-rich groundwater was produced due to a mixing of hot spring water with the surrounding groundwater. Studies of the saturation index of fluorite with log  electrical conductivity also indicate mixing of hot spring water with the surrounding groundwater. The spatial distribution of fluoride in groundwater follows the topography of the area.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Arrested prograde charnockite formation in quartzofeldspathic gneisses is widespread in the high-grade terrains of southern India and Sri Lanka. Two major kinds of orthopyroxene-producing reactions are recognized. Breakdown of calcic amphibole by reaction with biotite and quartz in tonalitic/granitic produced the regional orthopyroxene isograd, manifest in charnockitic mottling and veining of exposures, as at Kabbal, Karnataka, and in the Kurunegala District of the Sri Lanka Central Highlands. Chemical and modal analyses of carefully chosen immediately-adjacent amphibole gneiss and charnockite pairs show that the orthopyroxene is produced by an open system reaction involving slight losses of CaO, MgO and FeO and gains of SiO2 and Na2O. Rb and Y are depleted in the charnockite. Another kind of charnockitization is found in paragneisses throughout the southern high-grade area, and involves the reaction of biotite and to produce orthopyroxene and K-feldspar. Although charnockite formation along shears and other deformation zones at such localities as Ponmudi, Kerala is highly reminiscent of Kabbal, close pair analyses are not as suggestive of open-system behavior. This type of charnockite formation is found in granulite facies areas where no prograde amphibole-bearing gneisses exist and connotes a higher-grade reaction than that of the orthopyroxene isograd. Metamorphic conditions of both Kabbaltype and Ponmudi-type localities were C and kbar. Lower P(H2O) in the Ponmudi-type metamorphism was probably the definitive factor.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'The general circulation model of the NASA/Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS GCM) was designed primarily for global climate change and climate sensitivity applications. The modelling group at GISS has developed new and more physically appropriate parameterizations of meteorological/hydrological processes which are being validated in an effort to improve the performance of the Model II version of the GISS GCM. This study discusses some preliminary evaluations of this testing based on multiple-year simulations at latitude by longitude horizontal resolution. These runs individually incorporate new formulations of the planetary boundary layer (PBL), the moist cumulus convection scheme and the ground hydrology and compare results using B-grid and C-grid numerics. The new PBL produces a realistically stronger tropical surface circulation, while the new cumulus scheme generates more realistic distributions of tropical convection and moisture. The main impact of the more sophisticated ground hydrology model is to increase surface air temperatures. Improvements in modelled sea level pressure and rainfall features by the C-grid are somewhat offset by increases in speed excesses at the cores of the summer hemisphere westerly jets. Each modelling innovation targeted a different aspect of the climate not adequately represented by Model II. However, since the various modelling changes were tested individually, the present evaluation could not demonstrate many dramatic improvements in the simulated climates. This documentation of impacts should, however, serve as a benchmark for the validation of future simulations of the GISS GCM that combine all of the modelling improvements.\\'Abstract: \\'Within the framework of IWRM, a major concern in the humid tropics is the effects of on the storm rainfall-runoff hydrology of both forests and converted forest lands. Further how such effects need to be incorporated within adaptive, forest-water-land management. But since the mid- 20th century, dramatic changes in land- use (LU) and land cover (LC) have also occurred which have led to rapid rates of deforestation and an expansion of degradation. How much these man-induced impacts have been influential on climate relations, as against the effects of inherent climate variability and predicted climate change scenarios, still remains a major challenge to quantify. Thus embedded within the global warming issue are these additional LU/LC change impacts on climate-rainfall-storm runoff across scales which also require consideration under the broader mandate of The work will initially succinctly summarize the existing uncertainties linked with both Global Climate Models (GCMs). Subsequently more detailed attention will be given to uncertainties linked with LC/LU change. The experiences of hurricane Mitch in Central America will then set the scene for an alternative strategy. A principle message is a call for more concentrated research effort on geographically the outer margins of the (centred on the Indonesian Archipelago) in the Western Pacific where tropical cyclone frequency is very high. This region presents a diversity of socio-economies and an opportunity to produce adapted forest-land management measures in preparation for future global change (warming and anthropogenic). Such measures can then be extrapolated to currently less frequently, affected areas from extreme events like hurricane Mitch. Examples from research in the tropical- cyclone prone, of northeast Australia linked with the management of tropical rainforests and the adjoining sugar cane lands are then used to demonstrate these opportunities.\\'Abstract: \\'Habitat loss and fragmentation are significant threats for primate species worldwide. However, few attempts have been made to look for general patterns in primate responses to habitat loss and fragmentation, or whether these may be associated with traits. We conducted a review of published literature on effects of patch size to quantify the effect of a reduction in this predictor on primates, and to determine whether these effects depend on traits. The effects of patch size on seven response variables (density, parasite prevalence and diversity, presence, genetic diversity, time spent feeding, resting and movement), were extracted from 135 papers and compared across six species traits (diet specialisation, social structure, body size, home range size, group size and dispersal ability). We found that density, parasitic prevalence and diversity and time spent feeding were positively associated with a reduction in patch size, while presence and genetic diversity were negatively associated. Time spent resting and moving did not show clear patterns. We found little evidence that the effect of patch size varies consistently with traits. This study provides important evidence for the consistent effect of patch size on a range of factors that influence the dynamics of primate populations. However, there is a need to move beyond quantifying patch size effects alone and to quantify the effects of changes occurring at broader landscape scales. This would allow more holistic primate conservation strategies to be developed across whole landscapes rather than being focussed on the management of individualAbstract: \\' Achyranthes coynei Santapau (Amaranthaceae) is an endemic and red listed species of India.

The present research work has utilized Remote Sensing and GIS techniques for assessing vulnerability of the Gujarat coast due to predicted sea level rise. Synergetic use of satellite remote sensing, numerical simulations and filed observations has been done to generate coastal thematic information followed by validation. Coastal vulnerability assessment of the entire Gujarat coast on 1:50,000 scale were carried out considering five physical parameters. They are; coastal geomorphology, coastal slope, shoreline change rate, mean spring tidal range, and significant wave height. The rank values of all the five physical variables are integrated through additive method to compute a Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) where the relative ranking is assigned to various coastal segments based on the vulnerability level. The CVI values categorize Gujarat coast into four risk level classes. The results show that of the Gujarat coast is under high to very high risk category and of the Gujarat coast is under Moderate to Low risk category due to an anticipated rise in sea level. The coastal regions under very high risk category are along northwestern parts of the Gulf of Khambhat, the northernmost parts of the Gulf of Kachchh and western parts of the Kachchh coast. The southern parts of the Saurashtra coast and southwestern parts of the Kachchh coast is under the low risk category along with isolated segments along the eastern parts of the Gulf of Khambhat. The approach developed for assessing vulnerability of the coast to predicted sea level rise using remote sensing and GIS techniques can be used effectively by coastal management authorities and decision makers to devise better coastal zone management plans as well as to ensure efficient mitigation measures to minimize the losses due to possible impact of predicted sea level rise through which appropriate measures to protect life, property and environment can be timely planned.\\'Abstract: \\' Sesuvium portulacastrum L. (seapurslane) is a halophyte used as pioneer species in sand dune fixation and stabilization of saline soil. Studies on the morphological and molecular diversity were carried out for the 14 clones of Sesuvium collected from the different coastal regions of India. Significant differences were observed for morphological traits viz., length, width, diameter and area of leaf, internodal distance and stem diameter for different clones when compared with the clone from Gujarat state (GJ1). A UPGMA dendrogram for morphological traits based on the similarity coefficient clustered the clones into three groups considering 80% polymorphism as criteria. Molecular diversity among the clones was studied using Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and markers specific to Ac homologous region. Of the total 749 RAPD loci amplified with 70 random primers, 294 were polymorphic with 39.25% diversity. A phylogenetic tree constructed with UPGMA and SHAN, grouped the clones into three major clades based on RAPD data. The molecular diversity studied with ITS and markers specific to Ac homologous region revealed 37.50% and 66.66% polymorphism and clustered the clones into three and four clades, respectively. The genetic diversity analysis revealed wide variations among the S. portulacastrum clones, reflecting a high level of diversity within the species which might be due to anthropogenic impact and geographic environmental conditions. Further, the various clones from the different eco-geographic coastal localities might have originated from native places of wild abundance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to evaluate both morphological and genetic diversity among the Sesuvium clones collected from the distant habitats of the coastal regions of the India.\\'Abstract: \\'Climate change poses major challenges to agricultural systems in drought prone regions of the world especially in the areas with high poverty, lack of irrigation facilities and low productivity. Towards this it is essential to understand the climate change perceptions, adaptation practices and barriers to effective adaptation at household and community level. This paper using household surveys and focus group discussions in one of the drought prone areas of Odisha in India, explores various aspects of perception on climate change and barriers to adaptation. It also analyses the accuracy of perceptions based on rainfall data from nearest meteorological stations. The study reinforces the argument by earlier studies that the perception by people simply cannot be wrong because they may have a just a low correlation with underlying meteorological data. Results suggest that farmers increasingly perceive the changes in the rainfall and temperature patterns. However, when compared with the trend in actual rainfall data, perceptions on rainfall are found to more closely align with the results from the nearest station as compared to the station farther from it. Analysis revealed that seasonal rainfall variability has a profound influence on the perceptions on climate change and drought in the study region. are still dependent on the traditional forecasting system because of the lack of access to modern climate forecasting and tailored information for agricultural practice. Although farmers in the study region are already adapting to the changing climate, the study finds that while lack of access to water and irrigation, information on climate change adaptation and early warning systems are major barriers to adaptation at the household level lack of government intervention, lack of knowledge on drought resistant crops and varieties and lack of renovation of water bodies and irrigation were mentioned as the major barriers at the community level. Findings from the paper argue for better adaptation planning at the local level incorporating local level perceptions and barriers to adaptation. In such areas local level planning can be crucial in enhancing the adaptive capacity of the farmers.\\'Abstract: \\'The neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography emphasizes the importance of dispersal and speciation to macro-ecological diversity patterns. While the influence of dispersal has been studied quite extensively, the effect of speciation has not received much attention, even though it was already claimed at an early stage of neutral theory development that the mode of speciation would leave a signature on metacommunity structure. Here, we derive analytical expressions for the distribution of abundances according to the neutral model with recruitment (i.e., dispersal and establishment) limitation and random fission speciation which seems to be a more realistic description of (allopatric) speciation than the point mutation mode of speciation mostly used in neutral models. We find that the two modes of speciation behave qualitatively differently except when recruitment is strongly limited. Fitting the model to six large tropical tree data sets, we show that it performs worse than the original neutral model with point mutation speciation but yields more realistic predictions for speciation rates, species longevities, and rare species. Interestingly, we find that the metacommunity abundance distribution under random fission is identical to the broken-stick abundance distribution and thus provides a dynamical explanation for this grand old lady of abundance distributions.\\'Abstract: \\'A study was carried out to investigate the population structure and tree species diversity in two different forest types of Nagaland. A total of 40 and 48 quadrats were plotted randomly in subtropical semi evergreen (SSE) and tropical wet evergreen (TWE) forest, respectively; and trees girth at breast height were measured. Maximum 38 tree species belonging to 25 families in SEE and 30 species belonging to 24 families were recorded in TWE forest. Both the forest types were dominated by the tree species belonging to the Meliaceae family. A total of 613 individuals/ha with basal area were recorded in TWE forest as compared to the 512 individuals/ha with basal area in SSE forest. Shannon and Simpson diversity indices varied from and respectively. Moreover, girth class showed higher number of individuals followed by class. Tectona grandis, Gmelina arborea and Duabanga grandiflora were the dominant species in SSE, while TWE was dominated by Gmelina arborea and Grevillea robusta. The present study provides baseline data on population structure and diversity of trees in two forest types of Nagaland.\\'Abstract: study was carried out to assess tree diversity, forest carbon stock and carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration in Nambor tropical semi-evergreen forest. A total of 53 tree species from 47 genera and 32 families were recorded in the forest. Vatica lanceifolia was the dominant tree species with maximum 33.78 importance value index (IVI), 0.30 Shannon diversity index and 0.03 index (D) followed by Lagerstroemia reginae (20.75 IVI, 0.18 and 0.004 D), Dysoxylum excelsum (17.70 IVI, 0.20 and 0.006 D), Sterculia villosa (14.15 IVI, 0.09 and 0.0007 D) and Toona ciliata (11.60 IVI, 0.07 and 0.0004 D) as codominant species. Among the forest carbon pools, maximum 50.32% carbon was stored in soil followed by 39.42% in above ground biomass and 10.21, 0.03 and 0.02% in below ground, leaf litter and dead debris pools, respectively. Total ecosystem carbon stock in Nambor forest was estimated to be The estimated carbon stock was extrapolated over 3700 hectare area and found to be The total forest carbon stock was also converted into CO2 equivalents and estimated as The study observed that forest ecosystem offsets significant amount of atmospheric CO2; therefore, conservation and management of forest resources are imperative to combat global climate change.\\'Abstract: \\'The forestry sector can not only sustain its carbon but also has the potential to absorb carbon from the atmosphere. India has maintained approximately 64 Mha of forest cover for the last decade. The rate of afforestation in India is one of the highest among the tropical countries, currently estimated to be 2 Mha per annum. The annual productivity has increased from 0.7 m3 per hactare in 1985 to 1.37 m3 per hectare in 1995. Increase in annual productivity directly indicates an increase in forest biomass and hence higher carbon sequestration potential. The carbon pool for the Indian forests is estimated to be 2026.72 Mt for the year 1995. Estimates of annual carbon uptake increment suggest that our forests and plantations have been able to remove at least 0.125 Gt of CO2 from the atmosphere in the year 1995. Assuming that the present forest cover in India will sustain itself with a marginal annual increase by 0.5 Mha in area of plantations, we can expect our forests to continue to act as a net carbon sink in future.\\'Abstract: \"Tropical dry forest is the most endangered major vegetation type in the New Caledonia biodiversity hotspot.

The aim of this study is to identify different types of forest patches, and their condition under present land-use intensification, and discuss prospects for their integration into sustainable local farming systems. Five types of forest patches are distinguished, both natural and planted ones, including rows of trees, woody patches, gallery forests, hill-slope forests and homegarden conglomerations. Natural woody patches and gallery forests in Imperata grassland are subject to degradation and land-use conversion under conditions of agricultural intensification. Woody patches in grassland affected by frequent burning and grazing cover small areas (66% below 50 m2 as opposed to 28% in protected grassland) and contain relatively few woody plant species (25 woody species in total as opposed to 82 where protected). Yet where well managed, they may provide a variety of products for sale and subsistence, covering emergency needs and giving off-season cash income to rural communities. Moreover they serve like the gallery forest various ecological functions, carrying valuable indigenous tree species, retaining soil base nutrients, providing a continuous supply of organic matter and intercepting fine earth soil particles removed from bare surfaces. It is suggested that forest-patch management systems may be developed, taking into account both patch diversity and the diverse needs of rural communities, and to strengthen existing and undervalued functions of forest patches as permanent elements in an agricultural landscape.\\'Abstract: \\'Mulberry (Morus L.) is essential for the sericulture industry as the primary feed for the silkworm Bombyx mori L. in India, with its long tradition of practicing sericulture, has a large number of indigenous cultivars. Since knowledge on the genetic divergence of these cultivars/varieties is essential for proper conservation and utilization, Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) profiling was employed to assess genetic relationships among 34 mulberry accessions, collected from different regions of India. By using 12 ISSR primers, which produced 72 markers displaying a high degree of polymorphism (94.4%), genetic dissimilarity coefficients were calculated for each pair of the accessions and clustering of the accessions with Unweighted Pair Group Method using Arithmetic average (UPGMA) analysis was done to unravel the genetic diversity among the accessions. The dissimilarity coefficients varied from 0.111 to 0.692. UPGMA analysis generated a dendrogram with six groups and five isolates. Clustering of the accessions did not correspond with the information on the geographic origin of many of the accessions. Two-dimensional representations of the relative positions of the accessions with regards to divergence using the first two canonical variates as co-ordinate axes revealed considerable variability among the cases in each group. Further, Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) showed changes in the geographic origin of 11 accessions and species status of 20 accessions.\\'Abstract: \\'There is evidence that human beings are familiar with use of animals for food, cloth, medicine, etc. since ancient times.

A maximum number of adventitious shoots were regenerated from leaf-derived callus on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP; 2 acid (NAA; 0.5 and phloroglucinol (PG; Nodes collected from in vitro established shoot cultures were encapsulated in 3 % (m/v) sodium alginate and 1 % (m/v) calcium chloride. Multiple shoots were successfully regenerated from the encapsulated nodes cultured on MS medium supplemented with 3 BAP and 0.5 kinetin (KIN). Regenerated shoots from callus and artificial seeds were successfully rooted and acclimated to greenhouse conditions. Since roots of A. tagala are primarily used in traditional medicine, a protocol for regenerating roots directly from the leaf derived callus was also developed. Maximum root length was obtained when the callus was cultured in MS medium supplemented with KIN (1 indole acetic acid (IAA; 0.5 NAA (0.1 and PG (10 Biochemical parameters were studied in calli grown with and without PG in the medium to establish a correlation between these parameters and shoot morphogenesis. An increment of antioxidant enzymes (peroxidase and catalase) and metabolites (sugars and proteins), and a decrease in the amount of polyphenol oxidase was observed in the calli which were grown in the presence of PG.\\'Abstract: \\'In vitro propagation protocol was developed for Saussurea lappa (Clarke.) species threatened by over exploitation due to medicinal importance and habitat destruction in Ladakh region of India. The aim of the present study was to examine the main aspects of in vitro callus induction (CI) and plantlet regeneration of S. lappa. Explants were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium supplemented with various concentrations and combinations of auxins and cytokinins for in vitro CI and plantlets regeneration. Callus initiation and induction was observed within eight and fifteen days after inoculation. 2, 4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D) and Kinetin (Kin) was found to be more effective for CI frequencies in all the explants as compared to other combinations. Root and stem explants were found with better callus frequencies and early response as compared to other explants. Maximum number of shoots highest shoot length maximum root number and highest root length were found on MS medium with Kinetin (Kin) and Indole-3-butyric-acid in root derived callus explant. Plantlets with shoots were transferred to potting mixture containing sand: soil: perlite (1:1:1) for acclimatization to field conditions and further multiplication. For the first time, protocol has been developed in S. lappa for in vitro CI and plantlet regeneration that holds robust potential for metabolite production and large-scale propagation.\\'Abstract: \\'Global scale drivers such as international markets for shrimp can trigger large changes at local and regional scales. But there is also a poorly appreciated reverse process, operating from the bottom up, with potential for triggering changes at higher scales. Thus, effects of drivers can be seen as a two-way process in which global drivers and local and regional drivers can potentially impact each other. Here, we argue that not only can global drivers impact the sustainability of local and regional social-ecological systems, but sustainability at higher scales can also be impacted by changes at the scale of local and regional social-ecological systems. Using Chilika, a large lagoon on the Bay of Bengal, Odisha State in India as a case, we show that traditional small-scale capture fisheries supporting 150 fisher villages with some 400,000 people were marginalized by aquaculture development for tiger prawn and by state-driven hydrological interventions, with impacts on the ecology of the lagoon. These changes, in turn, contribute to global poverty and food insecurity, making it difficult for India to meet international targets such as millennium development goals. The marginalized fisherfolk become part of environmental justice and other social movements. With large parts of the lagoon converted into a virtual monoculture for the production of tiger prawn, changes in Chilika (a Ramsar site) contribute to wetland habitat loss at the global scale, and biodiversity losses, possibly including IUCN red-listed species.\\'Abstract: \\'Land use is a main driver of global biodiversity loss and its environmental relevance is widely recognized in research on life cycle assessment (LCA).

Initially this small (5 km2) forest was inhabited by substantial numbers of five species of diurnal primates and the forest was typical of Reserve Forests in northwest upper Assam. About two thirds of the forest had canopy cover of 20 50% or more. Civil unrest, political problems and a lack of resources for Forest Department personnel, however, resulted in rapid degradation of the area. After three years less than one third of the forest had more than 20% canopy cover; all primate populations had declined dramatically and the small percentage of juveniles in each species indicated that all were in imminent danger of local extinction. There was no evidence of hunting or trapping nor any large scale logging. Forest degradation was due primarily to small scale harvesting of forest products, selective cutting, and collection of firewood. Although only hand tools were employed, the forest inexorably declined in response to these steady pressures.

This catchment spreading an area of is drained by river Indravati, which is one of the northern tributaries of the river Godavari in its lower reach. In the present study, USLE is used to estimate potential soil erosion from river Indravati catchment. Both magnitude and spatial distribution of potential soil erosion in the catchment is determined. The derived soil loss map from USLE model is classified into six categories ranging from slight to very severe risk depending on the calculated soil erosion amount. The soil erosion map is linked to elevation and slope maps to identify the area for conservation practice in order to reduce the soil loss. From the model output predictions, it is found that average erosion rate predicted is 18.00 tons/ha/year and sediment yield at the out let of the catchment is 22.30 Million tons per annum. The predicted sediment yield verified with the observed data.\\'Abstract: \\'Crop and livestock losses to wildlife are a concern for people neighboring many protected areas (PAs) and can generate opposition to conservation. Examining patterns of conflict and associated tolerance is important to devise policies to reduce conflict impacts on people and wildlife. We surveyed 398 households from 178 villages within of Ranthambore, Kanha, and Nagarahole parks in India. We compared different attitudes toward wildlife, and presented hypothetical response scenarios, including killing the problem animal(s). Eighty percent of households reported crop losses to wildlife and livestock losses. Higher crop loss was associated with more cropping months per year, greater crop variety, and more harvest seasons per year but did not vary with proximity to the PA, suggesting that PAs are not necessarily for crop raiders. By contrast, complaints of were associated with people-grazing animals and collecting resources from PAs. Many households engaged in mitigation efforts. We found that only fencing and guard animals reduce crop losses, and no efforts to lower livestock losses. Contrary to our expectations, carnivores were not viewed with more hostility than crop-raiding wildlife. Households reported greater inclination to kill herbivores destroying crops or carnivores harming people, but not carnivores preying on livestock. Our model estimated crop loss was across surveyed households (highest in Kanha), while the livestock loss experienced was (highest in Ranthambore). Our comparative study provides insights into factors associated with conflict loss and tolerance, and aids in improving ongoing conservation and compensation efforts.\\'Abstract: \\'Swaziland is a small, topographically diverse southern Africa country whose mammalian fauna has been poorly studied. The distributions of small mammals in Swaziland were surveyed at 39 localities. A total of 15 species of rodents and ten species of insectivores were captured during the survey. The number of species of insectivore captured at a locality was positively correlated with mean annual rainfall, while the number of rodent species captured was negatively correlated with altitude. The number of rodent species captured was lower on Swazi Nation Land compared with privately owned land or protected land (reserves). This was probably due to the radical habitat alteration that had taken place on Swazi Nation Land, inter alia overgrazing by livestock, cultivation of maize and deforestation. The effect of this habitat alteration on the number of rodent species was more pronounced in high-lying areas of Swaziland. This may have been due to the fact that a large number of the rodent species inhabiting high-lying areas require thick, tall grassland habitats, whereas many of the low-lying species prefer more open habitats with less grass cover. Since grazing acts to reduce grass cover, it is suggested that the species inhabiting high-lying areas would be more affected by overgrazing, than low-lying species.\\'Abstract: \\'This paper presents a rain duration-dependent procedure based on the popular Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) methodology for computation of direct surface runoff from long duration rains. Curve numbers are derived from long-term daily rainfall-runoff data, and antecedent moisture condition (AMC) related with antecedent duration. Analysis of data from five Indian (large, in terms of area) watersheds reveals the calculated curve numbers to decrease with the considered duration, showing the existence of a characteristic value of minimum CN or maximum initial abstraction to occur in a watershed for a pre-selected AMC. The testing of the proposed procedure on the separate (measured) rainfall-runoff event data sets from the same watersheds suggests satisfactory workability of the method.\\'Abstract: \\'Climate change is a significant global issue of concern especially in context of its impact on environment. It affects the different ecosystems with significant impact on water resources, agriculture, forestry, health, industrial sectors and biodiversity as well. For sustainable management of biodiversity in the context of changing scenario of climate change, a coordinated strategy across the various levels of geographic/governance hierarchy as well as across strategic elements such as capacity building, knowledge dissemination, institutions partnerships, policy/instruments and technology, needs to be pursued. The paper covers the trends and impact of climate change especially on sustainable management of biodiversity in Asia and India.\\'sea cucumbers\\'Abstract: \\'Thirty-five new microsatellite loci from the sea cucumbers Holothurian scabra (Jaeger, 1833) and Apostichopus japonicas (Selenka, 1867) were screened and characterized using the method of magnetic bead enrichment. Of the twenty-four polymorphic loci tested, eighteen were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium after a modified false discovery rate (B-Y FDR) correction, whereas six showed statistically significant deviations (CHS2 and CHS11: P<0.014 790; FCS1, FCS6, FCS8 and FCS14: P<0.015 377). Furthermore, four species of plesiomorphous and related sea cucumbers (Holothurian scabra, Holothuria leucospilota, Stichopus horrens and Apostichopus japonicas) were tested for mutual cross-amplification using a total of ninety microsatellite loci. Although transferability and universality of all loci were generally low, the results of the cross-species study showed that the markers can be applied to identify individuals to species according to the presence or absence of specific microsatellite alleles. The microsatellite markers reported here will contribute to the study of genetic diversity, assisted breeding, and population conservation in sea cucumbers, as well as allow for the identification of individuals to closely related species.\\'Abstract: \\'Macrofungi play an extraordinarily important role in the catalysis of the nutrient cycle of deciduous and coniferous forests. Habitat degradation adversely influences the number of fruiting bodies of macrofungi and diminishes the diversity of the fungal community. The diversity of the terricolous- and lignicolous macrofungi assemblages were compared in stands of semi-natural and two plant associations modified by humans in different degrees in North-East Hungary. We used data from 15 permanent plots that were sampled for vascular plants and macrofungi. Rank-abundance curves and diversity profiles were applied for diversity research. The results indicated that structure and diversity of the terricolous macrofungi assemblages were mainly influenced by climatic and habitat conditions and the degradation of the plant associations to a lesser degree. The diversity of lignicolous macrofungi was primarily affected by the continuous presence, quality, and quantity of deadwood. Accordingly, the form and degree of forest management, as well as the age of the growing stocks, influenced community structure. If nature conservation planning and conservation activity are based on those biodiversity indicators which are good proxies for macrofungi biodiversity, the latter might be optimal for preserving macrofungi biodiversity.\\'Abstract: \\'While deliberations relating to negative consequences of large dams on the environment continue to dominate world attention, positive benefits provided by small dams, also known as check dams, go unobserved. Besides, little is known about the potential of check dams in mitigating global warming impacts due to less data availability. Small dams are usually commissioned to private contractors who do not have clear mandate from their employers to post their work online for public scrutiny. As a result, statistics on the design, cost, and materials used to build check dams are not available in public domain. However, this review paper presents data for the first time on the often ignored potential of check dams mitigating climate-induced hydrological threats. We hope that the scientific analysis presented in this paper will promote further research on check dams worldwide to better comprehend their eco-friendly significance serving society.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'The CC genome of Oryza is found in nine species of Oryza that are distributed on all continents having a tropical climate. Three diploid Oryza species with CC genome are found in Africa and Asia to Papua New Guinea. In southern South Asia these three CC genome diploid species can be found, O. eichingeri and O. rhizomatis in Sri Lanka and O. officinalis in India. AA genome wild relatives of rice are also found in the same geographic region. Germplasm of both diploid CC and AA genome Oryza germplasm has recently been collected from Sri Lanka. AFLP analysis was used to compare the genetic diversity of the two Oryza genomes from a similar geographic region in southern South Asia. In addition, the diploid CC Oryza germplasm was also analyzed by RAPD and SSR methodologies and the combined results were analyzed. The results show that in southern South Asia the diploid CC genome species have a high level of genetic diversity compared to the diploid AA genome species. Molecular marker analysis revealed that populations of O. rhizomatis from northern and southeastern Sri Lanka are genetically differentiated. One accession of O. rhizomatis was aligned with O. eichingeri. This accession was collected from the site of O. rhizomatis that is the closest to a population of O. eichingeri. O. eichingeri showed lower genetic diversity than the other two diploid Oryza CC genome species. O. officinalis accessions from Assam, India, and China were genetically less diverged from O. eichingeri and O. rhizomatis than two accessions of O. officinalis from Kerala state, India.\\'Abstract: \\'Resistance to stem rust and leaf rust in five D genome species of wheat viz., 267 accessions of Aegilops tauschii Coss., 39 of Ae. cylindrica Host, 17 of Ae. ventricosa Tausch, 4 of Ae. crassa Boiss. and 8 of Ae. juvenalis (Thell.) Eig were evaluated at adult plant stage. Two hundred and thirty nine accessions of Ae. tauschii, 30 of Ae. cylindrica, 16 of Ae. ventricosa, 3 of Ae. crassa Boiss. and 5 of Ae. juvenalis were resistant to stem rust pathotypes prevalent in South India at Wellington under field condition. Invariably, all the accessions of the five species were resistant to leaf rust pathotypes. Quantitative measurement of disease using area under the disease progress curve revealed the slow progress of disease in the resistant accessions compared to susceptible check (Agra Local). Since all the five species have D genome, it could be concluded that the genes present in D genome might play a vital role in leaf rust resistance, but in case of stem rust resistance wide range of differential response was noticed. Among the species evaluated, Ae. tauschii was exploited to a larger extent, followed by Ae. ventricosa and Ae. cylindrica for leaf and stem rust resistance because of the homology of D genome with hexaploid bread wheat. While, Ae. crassa and Ae. juvenalis could not be utilized so far, possibly due to partial homology which makes the transfer of traits difficult. So, these species have considerable potential as a source of rust resistance and may enhance the existing gene pool of resistance to stem and leaf rusts.\\'Abstract: new epithelial cell line, Horabagrus brachysoma fin (HBF), was established from the caudal fin tissue of yellow catfish, H. brachysoma and characterized. This HBF cell line was maintained in medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) and subcultured more than 62 times over a period of The HBF cell line consists predominantly of epithelial cells and is able to grow at temperatures between 20 and with an optimum temperature of The growth rate of these cells increased as the proportion of FBS increased from 5 to at with optimum growth at the concentrations of FBS. Partial amplification and sequencing of fragments of two mitochondrial genes 16S rRNA and COI confirmed that HBF cell line originated from yellow catfish. The HBF cells showed strong positive reaction to the cytokeratin marker, indicating that it was epithelial in nature. HBF cell line was inoculated with tissue homogenate from juveniles of Sea bass, Lates calcarifer infected with viral nervous necrosis virus (VNNV) and found not susceptible to VNNV. The extracellular products of Vibrio cholerae MTCC 3904 were toxic to the HBF cells. These cells were confirmed for the absence of Mycoplasma sp byIndia\\'Abstract: \\'We investigated the study on the endemic and endangered species of Dawkinsia tambraparniei were confined only the areas of the river Tamiraparani. These species are under threats due to the menace of anthropogenic stress. To recognize the crisis behind the particular species, it was analyzed histologically and molecularly from the five pollutant levels of river Tamiraparani. Histologically, the microscopic examinations were also carried out from the crucial organs such as the brain, gill, heart, kidney, and liver, which confirm the spiky survivability of the endemic fish. Assessment of fish organ damages was observed highly in Kokkirakulam and Vannarapettai. Probably with conserved molecular sequences, the species can be identified out from the encountered surveillance of the particular taxa leading to the evolutionary circumstances. The phylogenetic analysis of Dawkinsia tambraparniei populations showed that Cheranmadevi and Vallandau sites populations were closely distributed. Even though the species have similarity sequences of each population were shown that the closely related with same genus but other sub-species. The observed results emphasize the conventional measures to conserve the endemic species and more effectual planning to the proximity of endurances in inhabited zone.\\'susceptibility of host populations and confirming host specificity\\'Abstract: \\'Mikania micrantha (Asteraceae: Eupatorieae), widely called mile-a-minute, has been a persistent problem to forestry, plantations and biodiversity conservation in southwestern and northeastern India, as well as in Andaman and Nicobar islands. To supplement the previously imported Trinidad-originating Puccinia spegazzinii (Pucciniales: Pucciniaceae), a different pathotype (IMI 393076) was imported from Peru, South America, after obtaining the import permit from the Plant Protection Advisor to the Government of India. The Peruvian pathotype was held in the National Containment-cum-Quarantine Facility for Transgenic Planting Material at Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources in New Delhi as a quarantine organism for pre-release evaluation. Screening of M. micrantha populations from Andaman and Nicobar islands (12), Assam (15) and Kerala (3) indicated their complete susceptibility to the Peruvian pathotype. In the host-specificity tests, the rust could not infect any of the 25 plant species in ten tribes within Asteraceae, which confirmed its safety to non-target plant species. Further, none of the 31 sunflower cultivars/accessions screened were infected.\\'Abstract: \\'A mounting body of critical research is raising the credibility of Traditional Knowledge (TK) in scientific studies. These studies have gained credibility because their claims are supported by methods that are repeatable and provide data for quantitative analyses that can be used to assess confidence in the results. The theoretical importance of our study is to test consensus (reliability/replicable) of TK within one ancient culture; the Irulas of the Kodiakkarai Reserve Forest (KRF), India. We calculated relative frequency (RF) and consensus factor (Fic) of TK from 120 Irulas informants knowledgeable of medicinal plants. Our research indicates a high consensus of the Irulas TK concerning medicinal plants. The Irulas revealed a diversity of plants that have medicinal and nutritional utility in their culture and specific ethnotaxa used to treat a variety of illnesses and promote general good health in their communities. Throughout history aboriginal people have been the custodians of bio-diversity and have sustained healthy life-styles in an environmentally sustainable manner. However this knowledge has not been transferred to modern society. We suggest this may be due to the asymmetry between scientific and TK, which demands a new approach that considers the assemblage of TK and scientific knowledge. A greater understanding of TK is beginning to emerge based on our research with both the Irulas and Malasars; they believe that a healthy lifestyle is founded on a healthy environment. These aboriginal groups chose to share this knowledge with society-at-large in order to promote a global lifestyle of health and environmental sustainability.\\'Abstract: \\'The spatial distribution of basidiocarps of the ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycete Russula subsect. Foetentinae was assessed in a primary forest in the Western (India) dominated by the ectomycorrhizal tree species Vateria indica and Dipterocarpus indicus. Over a 7,700-m2 sampling area, both trees and basidiocarps of Russula subsect. Foetentinae were mapped during the first month of the 2002 rainy season. First-order spatial analysis revealed that the distribution of the 45 collected carpophores was highly aggregated, with 60% of all basidiocarps located at a distance lower than from the nearest one. The genetic structure of the Russula subsect. Foetentinae population was studied by inter-simple sequence repeat polymorphism analysis using three primers. Eighteen of the 45 genotypes were represented by single basidiocarps. Twenty-seven basidiocarps were identified as belonging to 11 genets or separated ramets. Five genets were small, with diameters ranging from 0.5 to The six others were large, with a diameter ranging from to a maximum measured distance of In spite of the lack of data concerning the reproductive biology of this species, the presence of large genets suggests that mature stands may shelter well-spread underground mycelium, crucial for durable interaction with plant partner.\\'Abstract: \\'The genotypes of black pepper are morphologically and genotypically highly diverse and carry all the cumulative variations inherited and maintained through generations. The present study describes the Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) or microsatellite based assessment of genetic diversity among forty popular genotypes and four different species of black pepper in Southern region of India. For isolation of SSR primers, our earlier attempts with enrichment strategies like affinity did not extract a single SSR primer due to close proximity of restriction sites to the SSR motif. Hence we developed a Reverse Genome Walking strategy with better enrichment efficiency of 72% that generated seven new SSR primers. Genotyping precisely discriminated majority of genotypes which indicated that the SSR primers are very informative. A total of 62 alleles with an average of 15.5 alleles over 4 loci were identified. All the SSR primers showed an average Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) value of 0.85. The estimated average Shared Allele Frequency ranged between 1.57 and 20.12%. The PCA plot revealed four closely related individual groups and identified Karimunda, Wild pepper and a local landrace as the most divergent genotypes. Cluster analysis exposed the genetic relatedness between hybrids and selections with other known cultivars. The introduction of black pepper from South India to Malaysia was emphasized from the observation of genetic similarity of Malaysian cultivar with other indigenous popular cultivars. The study was first to portray the precise genetic relatedness among the major indigenous genotypes of black pepper.\\'Abstract: \\'The community structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in the roots of drought-resistant trees, Moringa spp., was examined in semiarid regions in Madagascar and Uganda. Root samples were collected from 8 individuals of M. hildebrandtii and 2 individuals of M. drouhardii in Madagascar and from 21 individuals of M. oleifera in Uganda. Total DNA was extracted from the root samples, and partial nSSU rDNA of AM fungi was amplified using a universal eukaryotic primer NS31 and an AM fungalspecific primer AM1. The PCR products were cloned and divided by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with HinfI and RsaI. Some representatives in each RFLP types were sequenced, and a neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis was conducted for the obtained sequences with analogous sequences of AM fungi. The RFLP and phylogenetic analyses showed that AM fungi closely related to Glomus intraradices or G. sinuosum were detected in many samples. The AM fungal groups frequently detected in the Moringa spp. might be widely distributed species in semiarid environments.\\'Abstract: \\'Groundwater quality of the Tiruppur district in Tamil Nadu was investigated in this study to develop a Water Quality Index (WQI) model. Hydrochemical parameters showed tremendous variation in certain location over the seasons. Ionic chemistry of groundwater suggested that textile industries and rock-water interaction are major threats to the water quality. Analysis of Na and Ca concentration indicates that direct as well as the inverse cation exchange controls the natural cation chemistry. NO3 concentration shows that the pre-monsoon samples were affected by the fertilizer usage in agricultural fields. Na-Cl type of the water was dominant throughout the study area except few locations. WQI showed that 55% of the pre-monsoon samples and the 47% of the post monsoon samples were classified as poor/very poor/unsuitable for drinking category. Leaching of the textile waste and their transport to the downstream was well observed during the post-monsoon season. The specific contribution of river Noyyal in the transport of the solutes to the discharge zones was proved by the hydrochemistry of the samples.\\'Abstract: \\'The present study outlines an approach to classify forest density and to estimate canopy closure of the forest of the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago. The vector layers generated for the study area using satellite data was validated with the field knowledge of the surveyed ground control points. The methodology adopted in this present analysis is three-tiered. First, the density stratification into five zones using visual interpretation for the complete archipelago. In the second step, we identified two island groups from the Andaman to investigate and compare the forest strata density. The third and final step involved more of a localised phytosociological module that focused on the North Andaman Islands. The results based on the analysis of the high-resolution satellite data show that more than 75% of the mangroves are under high- to very high-density canopy class. The framework developed would serve as a significant measure to forest health and evaluate management concerns whilst addressing issues such as gap identification, conservation prioritisation and disaster to the post-tsunami assessment and analysis.\\'Abstract: \\'Sustainable food production is one of the major challenges of the twenty-first century in the era of global environmental problems such as climate change, increasing population and natural resource degradation including soil degradation and biodiversity loss. Climate change is among the greatest threats to agricultural systems. Green Revolution though multiplied agricultural production several folds but at the huge environmental cost including climate change. It jeopardized the ecological integrity of agroecosystems by intensive use of fossil fuels, natural resources, agrochemicals and machinery. Moreover, it threatened the age-old traditional agricultural practices. Agriculture is one of the largest sectors that sustain livelihood to maximum number of people and contribute to climate change. Therefore, a climate-smart approach to sustainable food production is the need of hour. Traditional agriculture is getting increased attention worldwide in context of sustainable food production in changing climate. The present article advocates traditional agriculture as a climate-smart approach for the sustainable food production and also deliberates the correlation between climate change and agriculture.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'The study explores the use of multiple criteria decision techniques in predicting spatial niche of Brown oak (also known as Kharsu oak, Quercus semecarpifolia Sm.) formation in midaltitude meter amsl) Kumaun Himalaya. Predictive models using various climatic and topographical factors influencing Brown growth and survival were developed to define its current ecological niche. Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) method involving pair-wise comparison was performed to rank the explanatory powers of each compared variable. Variables were suitably weighted using fuzzy factor standardization scheme to reflect their relative importance in defining species niche. An optimum indicator was then chosen for deriving a site suitability map of brown oak. This study establishes the role of aspect in the current distribution of the species along with known influence of altitude. Future niches of oak has been tracked in the projected climate change scenario of and rise in temperature and 20 mm in precipitation. The results show that on predicted and increase in temperature, present habitat of brown oak distribution may be reduced by 40 per cent and 76 per cent respectively.\\'Abstract: \\'We define a new monsoon index (MV) as the product of relative vorticity and equivalent potential temperature using the long-term NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data. The MV index provides new insights into the intraseasonal and interannual variabilities of the broad-scale tropical Asian summer monsoon (TASM), including the South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) and the South China Sea summer monsoon (SCSSM). On the intraseasonal timescale, the pentad-to-pentad MV index bears a close relationship to the broad-scale rainfall in the TASM regions. Among 29 summers from 1979 to 2007, in 23/27 summers the correlation coefficients are higher than 0.7 in the SASM/SCSSM region. However, in fewer than 9 summers, the correlations between the broad-scale rainfall and the existing circulation indices are higher than 0.7. On the interannual timescale, various existing SASM circulation indices are moderately or well correlated with all-India summer monsoon rainfall, whereas their correlations with broad-scale SASM rainfall are weak. In contrast, the summer mean MV index correlates well with the broad-scale SASM rainfall and all-India summer monsoon rainfall (correlation of 0.73 and 0.65, respectively). In the SCSSM region, the summer mean MV index also bears a close relationship to the SCSSM rainfall, although some discrepancies exist during certain years. The composite strong TASM shows a stronger low-tropospheric low pressure in association with the enhanced westerly winds and moisture transfer, stronger convection, and upper-tropospheric easterly winds, which indicate that the MV index can well capture the features of TASM.\\'Abstract: \\'In an age of Anthropocene, the urban landscapes are recognised as the of human-mediated alien species introductions. As the cities provide an ideal natural experimental system to investigate the patterns of alien plant diversity in urban landscapes, the present study aimed to unravel the taxonomic, biogeographic and ecological patterns of alien flora of of the largest urban centres in the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. The alien flora of Srinagar comprises 325 species, constituting ca.35% of total flora of the city. Out of the 325 alien species documented, 157 species (43%) were recorded to be under cultivation, while 168 species (57%) were growing in the wild (i.e., outside cultivation); those growing in the wild, in turn, comprised 110 cultivation escapes and 58 accidentally introduced plant species. Biogeographically, two-third of the alien plant diversity reported from Srinagar is native to Asia-Temperate. This indicates that climatic similarity between Asia-Temperate and Kashmir Himalayas facilitate in flourishing similar floristic diversity. The study highlights a relatively higher proportion of herbaceous growth form in the aliens growing in the wild (80%) than those under cultivation (43%). Similarly, 82% of the alien species under cultivation had a perennial life span, but those growing in the wild were dominated by annuals (44%). Currently, 45 species are growing as casuals and 124 species are naturalised (including 105 naturalised non-invasive and 19 naturalised invasive). Along the continuum of casual-naturalised-invasive categories, the contribution of cultivation escapes and accidently introduced aliens contrastingly shows decreasing and increasing trends respectively. Interestingly, the results revealed that the human practice of stopping cultivation of alien escapes increased rapidly as we move along the continuum. Thus, the present study has investigated the patterns of alien plant diversity in the urban landscape of Srinagar, and the results obtained offer scientific insights toward better scientific understanding and management of plant invasions in this Himalayan city, with wider policy implications for neighbouring urbanised landscapes in the Himalayas and other mountainous regions across the world.\\'India\\'Abstract: \\'Plantation forests not only impact carbon and water cycles, but also affect biodiversity, livelihoods, and shape regional economies. Each of these impacts differs across varying scales of analysis. This paper illustrates how forest, climate change and hydrology debates play out in the context of the forest plantations of Australian black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) in the upper Palni hills of southern India. We outline the contradictory perspectives of different local groups regarding the impact of plantations on catchment hydrology and water availability, and examine these in relation to changes in the regional economy and rainfall patterns. Our analysis indicates that changes in these two factors have played a more significant role than existing wattle plantations in affecting local and regional water availability. We suggest that ongoing debates regarding forest change relationships need to broaden their scope to include changes in regional rainfall patterns and shifts in regional economic activity. This approach is likely to provide a more realistic assessment of plantation forests in a dynamic regional context, and offer more resilient strategies for regional landscape and catchment management under conditions of high variability in rainfall patterns.\\'Abstract: \\'Garcinia gummi-gutta, popularly known as Malabar tamarind or kodampuli is fruit tree species of high potential. Acidic fruits are used either in raw or pickled form. Fruit is highly prized for its anti-obesity property owing to high hydroxycitric acid content in its rind. Though generally cultivated for its fruits, the plant has multifaceted uses in paint manufacturing industry, as medicine, source of edible fat etc. The present study concerned comparative morphological and physicochemical analysis of two morphotypes of Malabar tamarind, which revealed significant differences among them. Fruits and leaves of these morphotypes had distinctive morphological features. with higher rind recovery and fruit weight was identified for further crop improvement programmes. Further, dimethylsulphoxide was identified as better solvent for extraction of photosynthetic pigments, and hence could be recommended for future physiological studies.\\'Abstract: \\'Coleus forskohlii is an endangered multipurpose medicinal plant that has widespread applications. In spite of this, there have been few attempts to propagate its cultivation in India. The present communication presents an in vitro rapid regeneration method using leaf explants of Coleus forskohlii through direct organogenesis. Leaf explants that were excised into three different segments i.e. proximal (P), middle (M) and distal (D) were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium supplemented with cytokinins. MS Media containing 5.0 mg BAP (6-Benzylaminopurine) promoted regeneration of multiple shoots through direct organogenesis from the leaf, which were further elongated on MS media augmented with 0.1 mg L-1 BAP and 0.1 mg IAA (Indole-3-acetic acid), cytokinin and auxin combination. Regenerated and elongated shoots, when transferred to ose resulted in profuse rooting plants that were transferred to soil after acclimatization and maintained in a green house. The current protocol offers a direct, mass propagation method bypassing the callus phase of C. forskohlii and is suitable for conservation, large-scale commercial cultivation, and genetic transformation with agronomically desirable traits.\\'plant\\'Abstract: \\'Scaly bulb of Ledebouria revoluta is a natural source of several cardiac glycosides and is traditionally used in Indian and South African ethno-medicinal system from ancient age. High-frequency indirect somatic embryogenesis protocol via callus culture had been developed from bulb scale explant. Optimum embryogenic calli was induced on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and acid. A maximum of of the cultures responded after of culture on MS medium containing of thidiazuron, acetic acid and spermidine forming somatic embryos per callus. Individual somatic embryo was encapsulated in calcium alginate beads to produce artificial seeds (ASs). The ASs were stored at 4, 15, and temperatures up to The ASs showed germinability even after of storage at Plantlets were acclimatized with a survival rate of and after of these plants produced flowers. Chromosomal studies revealed cytological stability of the regenerants containing chromosomes in root tips and chromosomes in pollen grains, same as parental plants. The meiotic behaviour of the regenerants is also similar to that of parental plants. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis revealed that there is no somaclonal variations among the plants produced via somatic embryogenesis and they are true-to-type to their parental plant. These results confirm the very reliable method for short-term conservation and large-scale production of true-to-type plantlets of L. revoluta, which can be applied in pharmaceutical industries.\\'Abstract: \\'Indigenous knowledge has influenced native species selection in agroforestry systems worldwide.  However, scientific advancements in plant sciences, agroforestry technologies and trade have accelerated species movements and establishment beyond their native range.  Managing native and non-native species is an important area of research in agroforestry and this thematic issue includes 13 papers that cover a range of topics from the role of non-native species in agroforestry to management interventions to improve yield.  As evident from these papers, non-native plants are still an important component of agroforestry in many parts of the world.  Whether native or non-native, management interventions can increase the economic, environmental and social values of these species and that of agroforestry.  Collectively, these papers attest to the increasing body of foundational knowledge in agroforestry.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'A protocol for in vitro propagation of Isodon wightii (Bentham) H.

Gaps play an important role in forest ecology helping to preserve bio- and pedo-diversity, influencing nutrient cycles, and maintaining the complex structure of the late-successional forests. Over the last 30 years, numerous reviews have been written describing gap dynamics. Here we synthesize current understanding on gap dynamics relating to tree regeneration with particular emphasis on gap characteristics considered critical to develop ecologically sustainable forest management systems and to conserve native biodiversity. Specifically, we addressed the question: how do gaps influence forest structure? From the literature reviewed, the size of gaps induces important changes in factors such as light intensity, soil humidity and soil biological properties that influence tree species regeneration and differ in gaps of different sizes. Shadetolerant species can colonize small gaps; shade-intolerant species need large gaps for successful regeneration. Additionally, gap dynamics differ between temperate, boreal, and tropical forests, showing the importance of climate differences in driving forest regeneration. This review summarizes information of use to forest managers who design cutting regimes that mimic natural disturbances and who must consider forest structure, forest climate, and the role of natural disturbance in their designs.\\'Abstract: \\'The south west coast of Kanyakumari district in Tamil Nadu, India, is significantly affected by seawater intrusion and diffusion of pollutants into the aquifers due to unregulated beach placer mining and other anthropogenic activities. The present study investigates the vulnerability of the coastal aquifers using Geographic Information System (GIS)-based DRASTIC model. The seven DRASTIC parameters have been analyzed using the statistical equation of this model to demarcate the vulnerable zones for aquifer contamination. The vulnerability index map is prepared from the weighted spatial parameters, and an accounting of total index value ranged from 85 to 213. Based on the categorization of vulnerability classes, the high vulnerable zones are found near the beach placer mining areas between Manavalakurichi and Kodimanal coastal stretches. The aquifers associated with settlements and agricultural lands in the part have experienced high vulnerability due to contaminated water bodies. Similarly, the coastal areas of Thengapattinam and Manakudi estuary and around the South Tamaraikulam have also been falling under high vulnerability condition due to backwater and saltpan. In general, the nearshore region except the placer mining zone and the backwater has a moderately vulnerable condition, and the vulnerability index values range from 149 to180. Significantly, the northern and northeastern uplands and some parts of deposition zones in the coast have been identified as low to no vulnerable conditions. They are structurally controlled by various geological features such as charnockite, garnet biotite gneiss and granites, and sand dunes, respectively. The aquifer vulnerability assessment has been cross-verified by geochemical indicators such as total dissolved solids (TDS), HCO3 and ratio. The high ranges of TDS and values are well correlated with the observed high vulnerable zones in the study area. The ratio (7.13 to 12.18) of the high vulnerable zone obviously indicates deterioration of the aquifer contamination. Sensitivity analysis has also been performed to evaluate sensitivity of the individual DRASTIC parameters to aquifer vulnerability. This reveals the net recharge rate and groundwater table depth are becoming more sensitive to aquifer contamination. It is realized that the GIS is an effective platform for aquifer vulnerability mapping with reliable accuracy, and hence, the study is more useful for sustainable water resource management and the aquifer conservation.\\'Abstract: \\'Pradillo M , Santos JL (2011) The template choice decision in meiosis: is the sister important?Chromosoma120Abstract: \\'Shrubs belonging to Carissa genus (Apocyanaceae family) are potential sources of food, medicine and fuel, yet they are wallowing under obscurity and rarely been exploited. Edibility of the pulpy Carissa fruits is known to only a meagre few. Since antiquity, the stem, root bark, leaves, fruit and seed extracts have been used in folklore medication. Now, the emerging scientific investigations are validating the ethno-medicinal uses of these species. Bioactive compounds which include viz. polyphenolics, flavonoids, flavanones, lignans and sesquiterpenes imparting therapeutic potential to these species have been isolated. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown these species to have antioxidant, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic, wound healing, antimicroabial, antidiabetic, antiepileptic, anticancer, diuretic, nephrotoxicity amelioration and hepatoprotective activity. This miraculous plant extract has also been effective in the management of veterinary ailments. Apart from the medicinal attributes, this genus also holds promise as a suitable alternative crop for harvesting renewable energy. Micropropagtion is being tried for rapid multiplication of the valuable species. This review summarizes the recent findings for promoting the versatility of this genus.\\'Abstract: \\'Presently, it is debated if regional conservation efforts can alone resolve the ecological problems that global climatic changes could bring. Biological invasion is one of such concerns. In the present study, we modeled how change in global climate and regional anthropogenic pressure can impact the distribution of invasive Lantana camara in the Upper Ganga valley of the Western Himalaya (India). The forest in the study area was stratified into grid and two radius plot were located in each of the forest types in the grid, for recording Lantana presence. In total, 2221 plots were sampled covering 22% of forest. We used predictors representing the climate, forest patch size, fire and natural disaster variables for modeling the species distribution using maximum entropy algorithm. We further simulated 12 future landscape scenarios based on the global trends of these parameters. The present relationship was projected to these future landscape scenarios. Lantana was presently estimated to spread in of the study area. It invaded larger forest patches in the sub-tropical region, and smaller disturbed forest patches in the warm and cold temperate region. Increased distribution of Lantana was projected across all the future scenarios. The study revealed how global climate changes and regional anthropogenic pressure can have a synergistic effect on the expansion of invasive species in the future. It thus questions the efficiency of conducting only regional efforts in absence of global initiative to reduce the greenhouse gases emission.\\'Abstract: \\'The carbon sequestration potential of soils plays an important role in mitigating the effect of climate change, because soils serve as sinks for atmospheric carbon. The present study was conducted to estimate the carbon stocks and their variation with altitudinal gradient in the Lesser Himalayan foothills of Kashmir. The carbon stocks were estimated in different land use categories, namely: closed canopy forests, open forests, disturbed forests, and agricultural lands within the altitudinal range from 900 to 2500 m. The soil carbon content was determined by the titration method. The average soil carbon stock was found to be 2.59 kg The average soil carbon stocks in closed canopy forests, open forests, and disturbed forests were 3.39, 2.06, and 2.86 kg respectively. The average soil carbon stock in the agricultural soils was 2.03 kg The carbon stocks showed a significant decreasing trend with the altitudinal gradient with maximum values of 4.13 kg at m a.s.l. and minimum value of 1.55 kg at m a.s.l. The agricultural soil showed the least carbon content values indicating negative impacts of soil plowing, overgrazing, and soil degradation. Lower carbon values at higher altitudes attest to the immature character of forest stands, as well as to degradation due to immense fuel wood extraction, timber extraction, and harsh climatic conditions. The study indicates that immediate attention is required for the conservation of rapidly declining carbon stocks in agricultural soils, as well as in the soils of higher altitudes.\\'Abstract: \\'This paper identifies newer areas of arsenic contamination in the District Kanker, which adjoins the District Rajnandgaon where high contamination has been reported earlier. A correlation with the mobile phase episodes of arsenic contamination has been identified, which further hinges on the complex geology of the area. Arsenic concentrations in both surface and groundwater, aquatic organisms (snail and water weeds) soil and vegetation of Kanker district and its adjoining area have been reported here. The region has been found to contain an elevated level of arsenic. All segments of the ecoysystem are contaminated with arsenic at varying degrees. The levels of arsenic vary constantly depending on the season and location. An analysis of groundwater from 89 locations in the Kanker district has shown high values of arsenic, iron and manganese (mean: 144, 914 and respectively). The surface water of the region shows elevated levels of arsenic, which is influenced by the geological mineralised zonation. The most prevalent species in the groundwater is As(III), whereas the surface water of the rivers shows a significant contamination with the As(V) species. The analysis shows a bio-concentration of the toxic metals arsenic, nickel, copper and chromium. Higher arsenic concentrations (groundwater concentrations greater than are associated with sedimentary deposits derived from volcanic rocks, hence mineral leaching appears to be the source of arsenic contamination. Higher levels of arsenic and manganese in the Kanker district have been found to cause impacts on the flora and fauna. A case study of episodic arsenical diarrhoea is presented.\\'Abstract: \\'A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of two arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), Dentiscutata heterogama and Rhizophagus manihotis on the growth and nutrition of Juglans venezuelensis Manning. This species is currently considered a threatened tree species and the successful restoration of its populations depends on an increased understanding of the ecological and physiological aspects of its response to inoculation with AMF. In general, shoot and total dry weight, and leaf area were significantly higher in seedlings inoculated with AMF than in non-inoculated ones. Differences in height and leaf number between the inoculated and non-inoculated treatments become apparent after of plant growth. Inoculated plants had a greater leaf area as the result of the higher allocation of resources to leaf biomass (leaf mass ratio, LMR). The fraction allocated to the roots (RMR) was not significantly different between treatments. Differences between vital stain (SDH) and non-vital trypan blue stain (TB) showed that the D. heterogama colonization was almost entirely active compared to the R. manihotis colonization. The relative responsiveness (RR) of J. venezuelensis to inoculation with D. heterogama and R. manihotis was 21.8 and respectively, but colonization values were never greater than despite low P content in the soils used. The growth and physiological responses of J. venezuelensis to inoculation with two AMF species indicate that these microorganisms should be employed when propagating this threatened species for its subsequence reintroduction into its natural habitat.\\'Abstract: \\'The reproductive phenology and germination behavior of 15 important tree species (Acer laevigatum, Adinandra griffithii, Citrus latipes, Elaeocarpus prunifolius, Engelhardtia spicata, Ilex embelioides, Ilex khasiana, Ilex venulosa, Illicium griffithii, Magnolia lanuginosa, Magnolia punduana, Photinia cuspidata, Photinia integrifolia, Quercus glauca and Schima khasiana) were monitored at monthly intervals for two calendar years in subtropical broad-leaved humid forests of Northeast India. These species are either endemic or threatened to the region. The investigated species showed peak flowering during the spring- while fruiting peak was observed in the autumn-season. Of the fruit types, drupes and follicles were produced by many of these species. Majority of the species adopted zoochoric mode of dispersal. The germination phenology revealed that most of the species (Acer laevigatum, Elaeocarpus prunifolius, Illicium griffithii, Magnolia lanuginosa, Magnolia punduana and Quercus glauca) undergo a period of dormancy during winter season and germination collides with the onset of rain indicating that moisture aids in germination. The prevailing environmental condition coupled with human disturbance seems to be of potential importance in influencing the recruitment of the selected species. Such studies would help in formulating effective strategies for conservation of these species.\\'Abstract: \\'During the second half of the 20th century, the Ganga River ecosystem has been continuously altered by several ongoing anthropogenic processes, accommodating multi-dimensional pressure due to increase of nearly four-fold human population. For solution of any environmental issues of the river, the Earth System Science approach is required to have maximum socio-economic benefits to millions of people living in Indian and Bangladesh. A bibliography containing more than 250 references on environmental studies of the Ganga River was prepared to preserve its ecosystem by providing the baseline support in this regard.\\'Abstract: \\'The soil seed bank is a dynamic biotic component of plant communities that represents the memory in relation to selective events. Few studies have investigated the natural stock of germinable seeds in the gallery forests to evaluate their regeneration potential, although they are target of anthropogenic action. Thus, seasonal, horizontal, and vertical qualitative and quantitative variations of the seed bank of a gallery forest in the Brazilian Cerrado were studied to test the influence of the climatic seasonality, the influence of the physical structure, and depth of the soil in different microhabitats of the forest in this natural seed store. It was also compared the richness and abundance of species in the germinable seed bank with the above-ground vegetation. Three hundred and seventy-five soil samples were collected at the beginning (April 1998 and 1999) and at the end of the dry season (September 1998). These samples were collected in three microhabitats distributed transversally in relation to drainage line of a large stream, at five depths. The density of germinable seeds decreases with depth, and is similar among microhabitats and seasons. In of soil and of litter, 1390 seedlings emerged, being 743 dicotyledons and 647 monocotyledons. From 761 survivors, 263 were Cyperaceae, 206 Melastomataceae, 153 Poaceae, and 82 Onagraceae, the most abundant families. This study suggests that the diversity of the germinable soil seed bank is lower than that of the above-ground vegetation of the forest, and that the soil seed bank is not the principal regeneration form of this environment.\\'Abstract: \\'Factors affecting in vitro propagation were evaluated for Ceropegia attenuata Hook., an endemic and endangered plant having ornamental potential but a limited reproductive capacity. Rapid shoot multiplication from nodal explants was established using varying concentrations of cytokinins and auxins either alone or in combinations. The highest frequency of shoot induction was achieved when nodal explants were inoculated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 6-benzylaminopurine with a mean of shoots per explant. High concentrations of TDZ and KN resulted in stunted and vitrified shoots. Factors implicated in the promotion of floral transition of the C. attenuata have been identified which are 4-amino-3, 5, 6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram), 6-benzylaminopurine, sucrose and photoperiod. The highest frequency of flowering (100%) was obtained when axillary shoot explants were transferred to MS medium supplemented with picloram within of culture. Transfer of in vitro regenerated shoots to half strength MS medium with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) showed maximum root induction. The in vitro grown plantlets were successfully acclimatized in the glasshouse with 85% of survival and showed normal development. The developed protocol provided a simple, cost-effective approach for the conservation of endangered plant C. attenuata for replenishing its declining populations.\\'Abstract: \\'Multifaceted issues or paradigm of sustainable development should be appropriately addressed in the discipline of environmental management. Pollution of the biosphere with toxic metals has accelerated dramatically since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. In present review, comparative assessment of traditional chemical technologies and phytoremediation has been reviewed particularly in the context of cost-effectiveness. The potential of phytoremediation and green chemicals in heavy metals management has been described critically. Further, the review explores our work on phytoremediation as green technology during the last and hand in hand addresses the various ecological issues, benefits and constraints pertaining to heavy metal pollution of aquatic ecosystems and its phytoremediation as first case study. Second case study demonstrates the possible health implications associated with use of metal contaminated wastewater for irrigation in peri-urban areas of developing world. Our researches revealed wetland plants/macrophytes as ideal bio-system for heavy metals removal in terms of both ecology and economy, when compared with chemical treatments. However, there are several constraints or limitations in the use of aquatic plants for phytoremediation in microcosm as well as mesocosm conditions. On the basis of our past researches, an eco-sustainable model has been proposed in order to resolve the certain constraints imposed in two case studies. In relation to future prospect, phytoremediation technology for enhanced heavy metal accumulation is still in embryonic stage and needs more attention in gene manipulation area. Moreover, harvesting and recycling tools needs more extensive research. A multidisciplinary research effort that integrates the work of natural sciences, environmental engineers and policy makers is essential for greater success of green technologies as a potent tool of heavy metals management.\\'Abstract: \\'A process of organogenesis via callus with successful plantlet formation was developed for Anoectochilus elatus. Indirect organogenesis was achieved from in vitro-derived node, internode, and leaf explants. The explants were cultured on Mitra medium fortified with different concentrations and combinations of plant growth regulators such as cytokinins (N6-benzyl adenine [BA], thidiazuron [TDZ], kinetin [KN], N6-(2-isopentyl) adenine [2ip] and zeatin [ZEA]), auxins (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid [2,4-D], acetic acid [NAA], indole-3-acetic acid [IAA], indole-3-butyric acid [IBA], and 4-amino-3,4,6-trichloro picolinic acid [Pic]), and additives (citric acid, trisodium citrate, peptone, coconut water, potato extract, and banana pulp). Organogenic callus proliferation was highest from internode followed by node and leaf explants on Mitra medium supplemented with TDZ and NAA Organogenic callus derived from internodal explants produced an average of 41.8 shoots per explant, with average length of on Mitra medium supplemented with BA NAA and coconut water In rooting experiments, a maximum of 3.2 roots per shoot was observed with an average length of with 97.8% response on Mitra medium amended with AgNO3 The rooted plantlets were acclimatized in a mixture of garden soil, sand, vermicompost, and used tea waste (8:4:2:1 [w/w/w/w]) in a greenhouse environment, with a 72.3% survival rate. Finally, the well-developed plants were transferred to the National Orchidarium, Yercaud, Tamil Nadu, a unit of the Botanical Survey of India, Southern Regional Centre, for further maintenance and establishment under natural conditions for conservation.\\'Abstract: \\'An in vitro micropropagation system has been developed for the Ceropegia anjanerica Malpure et al., a rare endemic plant species having ornamental as well as medicinal potential but a limited reproductive capacity.

We conducted interviews and spatially mapped the land uses of a single traditional village comprising over thirty households. After mapping the different land uses for each household we selected ten households and conducted a census of the vegetation of their land use areas. Land use categories included homegarden, patio, rubber, tea plantation, and secondary forest and scrub. Land holdings varied in size between 0.18 and 1.34 hectares and comprised 39% tea land, 27% homegarden, 12% patio, 17% secondary forest and scrub land, and 4% rubber plantation. We identified a total of 268 plant species on the ten properties in a total of 216 genera and 84 families across all growth habits combined (trees, shrubs, herbs and climbers). Our results show three times the plant species richness in homegardens than for any similar research on tree gardens elsewhere, but a large proportion are exotic and almost all have some kind of utilitarian purpose. The top three tree species are palms in homegardens which represent over two-thirds of the stem density and half the basal area. The conservation activities within tree gardens emphasizes the perhaps local livelihoods and land management activities play in retaining tree species diversity comparable but dramatically differing in taxa as compared to the original rain forest.\\'Abstract: \\'Seeds of Strychnos nux-vomica have slow and erratic germination; thus different presowing treatments were applied to enhance the germination of its seeds collected from Tamaraikulam, Tamil Nadu, India. In addition, the effects of desiccation and different storage conditions on the germination of S. nux-vomica seeds were investigated. The results show that soaking in gibberellic acid (GA3) for incubation of seeds at for and alternate water soaking and drying for significantly increased the percentage germination compared to the control. Desiccation of seeds down to 10% moisture content resulted in better germination. Germination of S. nux-vomica seeds differed significantly between different storage periods, moisture contents of the seed and for first and second order interactions (p<0.001). The highest germination (92%) was achieved when seeds with 10% moisture content were stored at ambient temperature for Evidence from the present study indicates that S. nux-vomica seeds possess physiological dormancy that can be broken effectively by after-ripening. As seeds of S. nux-vomica are found to be desiccation tolerant, dry seed (10% moisture content) can be hermitically stored at ambient temperature for without losing their viability.\\'Maharashtra, India\\'Abstract: \\'In the present days, remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques are comprehensive tools for the assessment of water resource, its management and conservation. In this study, remote sensing and GIS techniques are taken into consideration for zonation of different groundwater prospects of Pravara basin. Several contributing factors in which groundwater potential of an area entirely or partially depends such as lithology, geomorphology, slope, soil, lineament density, drainage density, land use and rainfall are assessed individually as well as together for making the different groundwater prospect maps through influencing factor (IF) and frequency ratio (FR) techniques. In ArcGIS software, all these thematic layers are prepared using different satellite imageries and conventional data sets, obtained from different sources. All these layers are transformed into high-resolution raster format and meshed together in GIS environment using IF and FR methods. Groundwater prospect maps are constructed as a result of overlay analysis. Based on the constructed map of groundwater prospect zones, as a result of this study, the study area is divided into five categories of different groundwater potential zones: very high, high, moderate, low and very low. Validation of the resultant maps has shown that frequency ratio technique is having higher accuracy compared to the influencing factors The present study of groundwater zonation provides a simple and less time-consuming technique; also, the results can directly be used for planning and sustainable management in Pravara basin.\\'Abstract: \\'A study was conducted to characterize the land use, biomass and carbon status of dry tropical forest in Raipur district of Chhattisgarh, India using satellite remote sensing data and GIS techniques in the year of The main forest types observed in the area are Teak forest, mixed forest, degraded forest and Sal mixed forest. The aspect and slope of the sites influenced the forest vegetation types, biomass and carbon storage in the different forests. The standing volume, above ground biomass and carbon storage varied from 35.59 to 64.31 45.94 to 78.31 and 22.97 to 33.27 respectively among different forest types. The highest volumes, above ground biomass and carbon storage per hectare were found in the mixed forest and lowest in the degraded forest. The total standing carbon present in the entire study area was 78170.72 Mg in mixed forest, 81656.91 Mg in Teak forest, 7833.23 Mg in degraded forest and 7470.45 Mg in Sal mixed forest, respectively. The study shows that dry tropical forests of the studied area in Chhattisgarh are in growing stage and have strong potential for carbon sequestration.\\'Abstract: \\'The environmental education needs of a currently wealthy developing country, Libya, are outlined. Because of specific local requirements, the data presented clearly shows how such educational requirements differ in many respects from the various Western-style environmental sciences curricula.

This involves not only dealing with the effects of new developments but also with peoples who must adapt to new life-styles.\\'Abstract: \\'Micro-interventions in rural India to create sustainable livelihoods are all aimed at generating income and wealth through new activities, preserving and accumulating natural assets like water and trees, and empowering poor people by encouraging their active participation. We studied one such intervention in the state of Gujarat and its implications for sustainability. In this project, small and marginal farmers after being introduced to new economic activities were pooled together into a larger cooperative network that in turn fed into a company. This organisation created its own brand, used modern technology and accessed markets all over India. The idea of this experiment came from a well known NGO with experience of working in rural India. This experiment was a novel way of bringing poor farmers into the structure of a modern and reasonably large, market-driven enterprise, without creating wage labour or dispossessing people from their lands. The lessons from the experiment indicate the importance of understanding that participation and empowerment cannot be attained through a mechanical, target-driven and time bound approach. Instead, it could result in a relationship marked by dependence and passive participation.\\'Abstract: \\'Fat extracted from kernels of Shorea spp. (Dipterocarpaceae) in the tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra are traded under the name Borneo Illipe. The fat is used in chocolate formulations. The majority of kernels collected are fromShorea species in the sectionPachycarpae. Fat characteristics ofShorea species in this section show differences in fat quality in relation to its use as exotic sources in Cocoa Butter Equivalent (CBE) formulations. In order to comment on the future potential of the naturally occurring tree populations distribution maps of fiveShorea spp. involved in Borneo Illipe utilization are presented.\\'Abstract: \\'The purpose of this study was to characterize the land use, vegetation structure, and diversity in the Barnowpara Sanctuary, Raipur district, Chhattisgarh, India through the use of satellite remote sensing and GIS. Land cover and vegetation were spatially analyzed by digitally classifying IRS 1D LISS III satellite data using a maximum likelihood algorithm. Later, the variations in structure and diversity in different forest types and classes were quantified by adopting quadratic sampling procedures. Nine land-cover types were delineated: teak forest, dense mixed forest, degraded mixed forest, Sal mixed forest, open mixed forest, young teak plantation, grasslands, agriculture, habitation, and water bodies. The classification accuracy for different land-use classes ranged from 71.23% to 100%. The highest accuracy was observed in water bodies and grassland, followed by habitation and agriculture, teak forest, degraded mixed forest, and dense mixed forest. The accuracy was lower in open mixed forest, and sal mixed forest. Results revealed that density of different forest types varied from 324 to 733 trees ha-1, basal area from 8.13 to 28.87 and number of species from 20 to 40. Similarly, the diversity ranged from 1.36 to 2.98, concentration of dominance from 0.06 to 0.49, species richness from 3.88 to 6.86, and beta diversity from 1.29 to 2.21. The sal mixed forest type recorded the highest basal area, diversity was highest in the dense mixed forest, and the teak forest recorded maximum density, which was poor in degraded mixed forests. The study also showed that Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was strongly correlated to with the Shannon Index and species richness.\\'Abstract: \\'Seventeen mangrove species of eight families at seven riverine and fringe habitats in Goa West India were surveyed for Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) fungal diversity. Sixteen species were found to be mycorrhizal and one species showed no AM fungal colonization. AM root colonization was recorded at all seven sites and ranged from Maximum root colonization was recorded in Excoecaria agallocha (77%) and minimum colonization in Avicennia marina (6%). Paris-type colonization was predominant at all sites. Auxiliary cells were recorded in roots of Acanthus ilicifolius, Ceriops tagal and Sonneretia alba. AM fungal root colonization and spore density varied by plant species and site. Site average spore density ranged from 1.84 to 0.54 of soil. In total, 28 AM fungal species of five genera, viz. Glomus, Acaulospora, Scutellospora, Gigaspora and Entrophospora, were recovered. Glomus was the dominant genus, three species of which were sporocarpic forms. Maximum site species richness (SR) ranged from 16 to 5. Species richness was maximum in A. ilicifolius where seven species of three genera were recovered. Based on relative abundance (RA) and isolation frequency (IF), two common species, viz. G. intraradices and A. laevis, were recovered from all seven sites.\\'Abstract: \\'Investigation of forest canopy density has become an important tool for proper management of natural resources. Vegetation cover density can identify the exact forest gaps within a particular area which in turn will provide the appropriate management strategies for future. Forest canopy density has become an essential tool for identifying the exact areas where the afforestation or reforestation programmes needs to be implemented. The aim and objective of this article is to show up the existing density of forest cover using remote sensing and geographic information system tools. Weighted overlay analysis method has been adopted for investigating forest canopy density of Sali river basin, Bankura district, West Bengal. Several indices likewise normalized difference vegetation index, bareness index, shadow index and perpendicular vegetation index etc. have been used for this study. Higher the weight was assigned for greater concentration of vegetation and lower the weight was assigned for lesser concentration of vegetation. Southern part of the region has very high density of forest coverage in comparison with the northern part of the region. It has been observed that 7.48% of the area is at very low density, 12.63% of low density, 24.84% of medium density, 23.92% of high density and 31.13% of very high forest canopy density.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'The dynamics and factors responsible for morphological changes of spits viz., Uliyargoli-Padukere, Oddu Bengre and Kodi Bengre, southern Karnataka, India, are investigated using multi-dated satellite images and topographic maps during the last 95-years Variations and overall rate of changes in length, area and coefficient of determination (R2) of each spit are calculated separately for two periods (1910 and 1967 as base years) to find out whether there is any significant trend in the case of change in length and area in all the three spits that are under study. Linear trend lines are fitted using a least squares method and the statistical significance is considered at level of confidence. The results recorded significant changes in spit morphology, especially in length and area if 1910 and 1967 are considered separately as base years, are may be due to non-availability of data set between 1910 and 1967 period. The study reveals that coastal processes, such as SW-monsoon influenced strong currents and longshore drifts are the main process for formation and growth of spits, whereas rivers influence/drift also plays significant role. The statistical uncertainty estimation in spits morphology is prevalent wherever the coast is affected by human interventions. The study demonstrates that combined use of satellite imagery and statistical techniques can be effectively used to understand the evolution of spits morphology.\\'Karnataka)\\'Abstract: \\'Insect communities associated with wood decaying macro fungi inhabiting fallen trees in Rajiv Gandhi National Park (Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, Karnataka) were investigated during Fruiting bodies of 19 species of polypores were collected from fallen logs of different species at varied stages of deterioration. A total of 43,711 insects belonging to 91 morpho species from ten different orders were found inhabiting the fruiting bodies. Coleoptera was found to be the most abundant and species rich group. The insect emergence followed a temporal pattern. Some of the most common groups like Ciidae and Erotylidae had two or three generations per year. Ciidae was found to be the most generalist feeder, in which one unidentified species was found to breed on 11 species of fungal fruit bodies. There existed a niche partitioning among the insect communities in fresh and dried fruiting bodies. A mild positive correlation was found between the number of insect species emerged and weight of the fruiting bodies. The study elaborated the intricate relationships among wood substrates, fungal fruiting bodies and the insect faunal diversity it supports and highlighted the fact that the wood decaying fungi and thereby decomposing wood are important components of forest ecosystem, conserving valuable diversity of insects.\\'Abstract: \\'Most of the chemicals containing non-biodegradable metal pollutants from anthropogenic sources are highly mobile in nature. The only way to contain or limit their movement is through sorption and entrapment in the soil matrices. In this study, the sorptive response of the three most commonly found divalent metal contaminants, copper (Cu+2), lead (Pb+2), and zinc (Zn+2), are studied using two locally available semi-arid soils from Saudi Arabia. To enhance their retention capacity, these soils are amended with lime. The response to sorption at varying initial contaminant concentrations, pH conditions, temperature levels, and dilution ratios are investigated. Relying on empirical models (Langmuir and Freundlich), the nature of sorption (monolayer or heterogeneous) is ascertained. Further, kinetic models are employed to validate the type and nature of sorption that occurs (whether pseudo first-order or second-order). It is found that the experimental results correlate well with these empirical models for both the Al-Ghat and Al-Qatif soils when amended with lime and attenuate Cu, Pb, and Zn to satisfactory levels. The R 2 values are close to 1 for all the tested models. The order of sorption was for these heavy metals, and also for soils and soil mixtures that were considered: Al-Qatif soil amended with soil with Lime-treated soils sorbed 73, 65, and more than the untreated soils for Pb, Cu, and Zn, respectively.\\'Abstract: \\'An indigenous promising root tuber crop (Flemingia procumbens Roxb.) was studied for morphology and selected proximate components and micro-nutrients in root tubers based on field surveys undertaken in the areas of cultivation.

Medicinal plant-based ancient wisdom could serve as a powerful tool to facilitate focused research on natural compounds for the drug discovery process. Medicinal plants are more important sources for drug discovery, specifically lead molecules as these offer several advantages over the synthetic molecules. Since in post genomic era, molecular targets for most diseases are known, conventional bioscreening strategies for medicinal plants are not sufficient to fulfill the present demand. It makes the role of medicinal plants more significant than ever before. The rich heritage of Indian medicinal plants can be explored utilizing various computational approaches for bioprospecting in the post-genomic era. In this review, the authors explore how Indian medicinal plant legacy can be utilized in post-genomic era utilizing the computational, bioinformatics, chemo-informatics, genomics and systems biology approaches. This approach shall make possible the systematic analysis integrating traditional and modern data in order to validate medicinal plant based knowledge.\\'Abstract: \\'A jungle tribe, the Jenu-Kurubas gather the honey in the month of June. Having hit upon a hive in a hollow tree, they tie a bamboo, the short cut branches of which form a convenient ladder, to the tree during the day time and at night, provided with a basket attached to a long rope and lined with leaves, they climb up with a strongly smoking torch which they hold near the hive. The alarmed and half stunned bees fly away and their honeycombs are removed and let down in the basket. Whilst thus engaged, the Kurubas have a peculiar song, made for the occasion and expressing their feigned sympathy with the spoilated bees, so rudely disturbed of their nightly rest.

The compound was first reported from Amoora rohituka (Meliaceae) and later from Dysoxylum binectariferum (Meliaceae) and Schumanniophyton problematicum (Rubiaceae). Flavopiridol, a semi-synthetic derivative of rohitukine is a potent CDK inhibitor and is currently in Phase III clinical trials. In this study, the isolation of an endophytic fungus, Fusarium proliferatum (MTCC 9690) from the inner bark tissue of Dysoxylum binectariferum Hook.f (Meliaceae) is reported. The endophytic fungus produces rohitukine when cultured in shake flasks containing potato dextrose broth. The yield of rohitukine was dry mycelial weight, substantially lower than that produced by the host tissue. The compound from the fungus was authenticated by comparing the and spectra with those of the reference standard and that produced by the host plant. Methanolic extract of the fungus was cytotoxic against HCT-116 and MCF-7 human cancer cell lines for both cancer cell lines).\\'Abstract: \\' The holotype of Caliris keralensis (Vyjayandi et al. 2006) (Mantodea: Caliridinae) is reviewed along with another paratype female not listed by the authors.

Male genital complex is described for better understanding the species.\\'Abstract: \\'Before an exotic pathogen can be released as a classical biological control agent the likely positive and negative outcomes of that introduction must be agents against weeds world-wide. These pathogens have been reported infecting only six non-target plant species outdoors and all of these incidents were predicted. Many more non-target plant species developed disease symptoms in glasshouse tests than in the field. Consequently, data from other sources are needed to ensure pathogens are a safe and useful tool for weed control, especially in natural areas rich in valued non-target species.\\'Abstract: \\'Firewood is a major energy source in India. Yet no minimum fuel efficiency standards have been set for firewood devices. This paper describes methods of determining the first law efficiencies of open fires, chulahs and other wood-based heaters. About thirteen different stoves have been tested and efficiency standards for stoves have been suggested.\\'Abstract: \\'Growing population and expansion of settlements over hilly areas have largely increased the impact of landslide. This paper deals with the use of Geoinformatics technology and Fuzzy Gamma Operator model to map the landslide susceptibility zones in part of Kohima Town, Nagaland. For this study, eight landslide inducing parameters such as slope gradient, slope aspect, curvature, elevation, land use and land cover, drainage density, lineament density, and topographical wetness index were considered and prepared with the help of toposheet, high resolution satellite imagery such as World View II, LISS IV, DEM data and field data. Landslide inventory was the first step for the geospatial database generation which involves the mapping of past landslide details. Landslide susceptibility maps were generated by calculating relationship between the landslide inducing factors with past landslide locations using frequency ratio and fuzzy gamma operator model. The ratios were normalized between the range of 0 and 1 to obtain fuzzy membership values. The landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) map were prepared by integrating all the causative factors with fuzzy membership values and classified into five different susceptibility classes based on Jenks natural breaks classification viz. very high (37.51%), high (32.21%), moderate (20.97%), low (7.97%), and very low (1.34%). The LSZ map were compared with the landslide inventory map and validated with best prediction accuracy using area under curve (AUC) with the accuracy level and R-Index.\\'Abstract: \\'An accurate characterization of tree, understory, deadwood, floor litter, and soil organic carbon (SOC) pools in temperate forest ecosystems is important to estimate their contribution to global carbon (C) stocks. However, this information on temperate forests of the Himalayas is lacking and fragmented. In this study, we measured C stocks of tree (aboveground and belowground biomass), understory (shrubs and herbaceous), deadwood (standing and fallen trees and stumps), floor litter, and soil from 111 plots of each, in seven forest types: Populus deltoides (PD), Juglans regia (JR), Cedrus deodara (CD), Pinus wallichiana (PW), mixed coniferous (MC), Abies pindrow (AP), and Betula utilis (BU) in temperate forests of Kashmir Himalaya, India. The main objective of the present study is to quantify the ecosystem C pool in these seven forest types. The results showed that the tree biomass ranged from in BU forest to for the AP forest. The understory biomass ranged from in PD forest to in PW forest. Deadwood biomass ranged from in PD forest to for the AP forest, whereas forest floor litter ranged from in BU and JR forests to in MC forest. The total ecosystem carbon stocks varied from 112.5 to C across all the forest types. The C stocks of tree, understory, deadwood, litter, and soil ranged from 45.4 to 135.6, 0.08 to 1.18, 0.7 to 6.8, 1.1 to 1.4, and respectively, which accounted for 61.3, 0.2, 1.4, 0.8, and of the total carbon stock. BU forest accounted from soil C and from biomass, whereas PD forest contributed only from soil C and from biomass. Of the total C stock in the soil, about was stored in the upper Soil C stocks in BU forest were significantly higher than those in other forests. The variability of C pools of different ecosystem components is influenced by vegetation type, stand structure, management history, and altitude. Our results reveal that a higher percentage of C is stored in biomass and less in soil in these temperate forests except at the higher elevation broad-leaved BU forest. Results from this study will enhance our ability to evaluate the role of these forests in regional and global C cycles and have great implications for planning strategies for conservation. The study provides important data for developing and validating C cycling models for temperate forests.\\'Abstract: \\'Invasive alien organisms can impact adversely on indigenous biodiversity, while riparian invasive alien trees (IATs), through shading of the habitat, can be a key threat to stream invertebrates. We ask here whether stream fauna can recover when the key threat of riparian IATs is removed. Specifically, we address whether IAT invasion, and subsequent IAT removal, changes benthic macroinvertebrate and adult dragonfly assemblages, for the worse or for the better respectively. Natural riparian zones were controls. There were statistically significant differences between stream reaches with natural, IAT-infested and IAT-cleared riparian vegetation types, based on several metrics: immature macroinvertebrate taxon richness, average score per macroinvertebrate taxon (ASPT), a macroinvertebrate subset (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata larvae; EPTO), and adult dragonfly species richness. Reaches with natural vegetation, or cleared of IATs, supported greater relative diversity of macroinvertebrates than reaches shaded by dense IATs. Greatest macroinvertebrate ASPT and EPTO were in reaches bordered by natural vegetation and those bordered by vegetation cleared of IATs, and the lowest where the riparian corridor was IATs. Highest number of adult dragonflies species was along streams cleared of dense IATs. Overall, results showed that removal of a highly invasive, dense canopy of alien trees enables recovery of aquatic biodiversity. As benthic macroinvertebrate scores and adult dragonfly species richness are correlated and additive, their combined use is recommended for river condition assessments.\\'Abstract: \\'Molecular genetic fingerprints of nine Curcuma species from Northeast India were developed using PCR-based markers. The aim involves elucidating there intra- and inter-specific genetic diversity important for utilization, management, and conservation. Twelve random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), 19 Inter simple sequence repeats (ISSRs), and four amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primers produced 266 polymorphic fragments. ISSR confirmed maximum polymorphism of 98.55% whereas RAPD and AFLP showed 93.22 and 97.27%, respectively. Marker index and polymorphic information content varied in the range of and and and for RAPD, ISSR, and AFLP markers, respectively. The average value of number of observed alleles, number of effective alleles, mean gene diversity, and information index were and respectively, for three DNA markers used. Dendrograms based on three molecular data using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) was congruent and classified the Curcuma species into two major clusters. Cophenetic correlation coefficient between dendrogram and original similarity matrix were significant for RAPD ISSR and AFLP Clustering was further supported by principle coordinate analysis. High genetic polymorphism documented is significant for conservation and further improvement of Curcuma species.\\'Abstract: \\'A land surface region can be decomposed into a series of watershed units with a hierarchical organizational structure. For loess landform, the watershed is a basic unit that can express natural landforms, surface morphology characteristics, spatial organization and developmental evolution. In this research we adopted the concept of node calibration in the watershed structure unit, selected six complete watersheds on China Loess Plateau as the research areas to study the quantitative characteristics of the hierarchical structure in terms of watershed geomorphology based on digital elevation model (DEM) data, and then built a watershed hierarchical structure model that relies on gully structure feature points. We calculated the quantitative indices, such as elevation, flow accumulation and hypsometric integral and found there are remarkably closer linear correlation between flow accumulation and elevation with increasing gully order, and the same variation tendency of hypsometric integral also presented. The results showed that the characteristics of spatial structure become more stable, and the intensity of spatial aggregation gradually enhances with increasing gully order. In summary, from the view of gully node calibration, the China Loess watershed structure shows more significantly complex, and the developmental situation variation of the loess landforms also exhibited a fairly stable status with gully order increasing. So, the loess watershed structure and its changes constructed the complex system of the loess landform, and it has the great significance for studying the spatial pattern and evolution law of the watershed geomorphology.\\'Abstract: \\'The genus Piper is well known for their medicinal and economic potentials and is distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Majority of the taxa under the genus Piper are morphologically confusing because of the wide range of variations within the vegetative characters. A total of 22 morphological characters, including both vegetative and reproductive characters were studied at a mature stage in 35 accessions of Piper taxa collected from North East India representing 12 species. The morphometric variables were analyzed using variance and Principal Component Analysis. It was carried out to identify the useful characters that can contribute to distinguish various species. The Unweighted Pair Group Method and Arithmetic Average clustering method for the vegetative traits and reproductive traits show two principal clusters. The present study revealed the importance of the morphological characters in delimitation of taxonomic grouping of the confusing species.\\'Abstract: \\'We studied the spatio-temporal patterns of ground-dwelling and -foraging ant assemblages in a continuous mixed secondary lowland rainforest on the northern periphery of the Dja Biosphere Reserve in southeast Cameroon. The effect of season and of the interaction of season with vegetation type on ant species density, activity and composition were investigated. We also checked for a possible impact of army ant activity on the ant assemblage. Ants were collected by pitfall trapping in seven vegetation types in each of three seasons during 12 months in 2003 and Season significantly influenced the ground-dwelling ant assemblage. The late wet season had the lowest ant species density and a different species composition than the early wet and the dry season. Also inter-annual variation in ant species density and composition was detected and could partly be explained by an influence of Dorylus activity. In general, vegetation type and inter-annual variation had a larger influence on the ground-ant assemblage than season. Significant effects of interactions between season, year, vegetation type and army ants on the ant assemblage confirm that also in African rainforests ant assemblages are extremely dynamic and depend on a complex combination of availability of food resources, nest sites and predators.\\'Abstract: \\'Satellite Remote Sensing data has been used for vegetation mapping, initial stratification, distribution of sample plots and for calculating the area under different vegetation types. Primary and secondary analyses of vegetation has been done using phytosociological ground data collected from sample piots to assess the ecological importance of different species. Interrelationships among different communities have been evaluated through various available indices. The spatial distribution and vegetation analysis indicate that commercial extraction of natural forests of Andaman has set in retrogression. The evergreen forests subjected to shorter rotation of commercial exploitation are being invaded with seral deciduous species. The study highlights the status of forests (spatial and community) and stresses the need to conserve germplasm present in the natural evergreen forests.\\'Abstract: \\'Tropical forests are well known to have great species diversity and contribute substantial share in terrestrial carbon (C) stocks worldwide. Shrubs are long-neglected life form in the forest ecosystem, playing many roles in the forest and human life. Shrub has great impact on vegetation attributes which in turn modify the C storage and capture. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore the dynamics of shrub species in four fire regimes, viz. high, medium, low, and no fire zones of Bhoramdeo Wildlife Sanctuary of Kawardha forest division (Chhattisgarh), India. The variations in structure, diversity, biomass, productivity, and C sequestration potential in all the sites were quantified. The density and basal area of shrub varied from 1250 to 3750 individuals and 2.79 to respectively. The diversity indices showed that the value of Shannon index was highest in medium fire zone (3.77) followed by high, low, and no fire zones as 3.25, 3.12, and 2.32, respectively. The value of index or concentration of dominance (Cd) ranged from 0.08 to 0.20, species richness from 0.56 to 1.58, equitability from 1.41 to 1.44, and beta diversity from 1.50 to 4.20, respectively. The total biomass and C storage ranged from 6.82 to 15.71 and from 2.93 to respectively. The shrub density, importance value index (IVI), and abundance to frequency ratio (A/F) significantly correlated between high fire and medium fire zone. The basal area was found to be significantly positively correlated between high fire and medium fire, and low and no fire zones, respectively. Two-way cluster analysis reflected various patterns of clustering due to influence of the forest fire which showed that some species have distant clustering while some have smaller cluster. Principal component analysis (PCA) reflects variable scenario with respect to shrub layer. Ventilago calyculata and Zizyphus rotundifolia showed higher correlation between themselves in terms of basal area (BA). The total shrub production was while the C sequestration potential of under different fire regimes. Shrub community in the medium fire zone reflected higher productivity and higher C sequestration in comparison to other fire zone. Among the different plant parts, the biomass accumulation ratio was highest in the root of shrub community among various fire regimes. Screening of species for restoration and different land-use pattern on the basis of biomass accumulation and carbon sequestering potential would be an effective strategy for decision-making in sustainable forest management.\\'Abstract: \\'The present study was designed to note the birds occurring in the microhabitats of Bangalore University Campus, India. Birds were monitored and surveyed using line transect methods that were laid in different spots of the campus. Twenty-eight species were newly added to this campus premises, out of which 20 are waterbirds. Conservation methods needed for habitat improvement through restoration of ponds and water check-dams including vegetation.\\'Abstract: \\'Few studies explicitly assess the temporal and spatial dynamics of agroforestry adoption occurring beyond the project cycle. Where ex-post evaluations are published, abandonment of introduced agroforestry after project cessation is often reported. This paper presents an analysis of agroforestry adoption in a poor, peri-urban village in semi-arid south India, where of initial adopters had retained their plots six to eight years after implementation. The intervention was facilitated by BAIF, an Indian non-governmental organisation specialising in natural resource management. The complex technological package promoted was known as and comprised fruit trees planted in crop fields, with a boundary of multi-purpose trees and integrated soil and water conservation measures. Sixty four agroforestry plots belonging to 43 households were surveyed in 2010/11 and interviews were held with both adopting and non-adopting farmers. Beyond retention, a quarter of adopters had expanded the practice on to additional areas of land and some diffusion to initially non-adopting farmers had also occurred. Adopters were found to have modified the practice to suit their own objectives, capabilities and constraints, highlighting that adoption is more than a simple binary choice. The study demonstrates the importance of external support for adoption of agroforestry. The intervention was not, however, especially pro-poor with adoption occurring disproportionately among relatively wealthier households with larger landholdings. Where poorer households adopted, this tended to occur later. Participation was entirely voluntary and, by 2011, conversion of suitable farmland to agroforestry had reached while beneficial to individual adopters, this patchy coverage arguably limits the potential for enhanced ecosystem service provision at landscape-scale.\\' the subject is provided. The systematic exploratory phase of taxonomy is said to have started around the middle of 16th century and with two major events, the subject reached its peak. The first one being the development of the concept of Herbarium and second one being the introduction of the Binomial System of Nomenclature by Linnaeus in 1753. Both the events laid the firm foundation for Classical Taxonomy. But during the last few decades with the development of Bio-systematic phase, although revolutionary changes in concepts of taxonomy could be noticed, the Classical Taxonomy got completely side tracked. Discussing the current status of Taxonomy  biology, faulty methods of teaching by untrained taxonomists in most Universities, lack of sufficient taxonomic literature and herbaria, synthetic nature of discipline of taxonomy, lack of sufficient number of practicing taxonomists and field botanists to carry out the survey and documentation of the vast diversity of the flora of India, most taxonomic journals with least or no impact factor, low citation index of Classical Taxonomists, development of computer databases and computer identification devices by non-taxonomists, molecular biologists side tracking the Classical Taxonomists in areas of biodiversity assessments, avoidance of taxonomists by modern biologists in programmes of Bioprospection, apathy towards the subject by fund giving bodies and lastly, least recognitions of Classical Taxonomists by scientific bodies are cited as prominent reasons for the decline of the subject. Although Botanical Survey of India has done a commendable job in accomplishing the tasks of Taxonomists, some how the organization has failed in generating and enthusing the required number of younger taxonomists and group specialists in the country. Worse is the case with many Universities who have, to some extent killed the subject. All these factors have collectively brought about a serious decline in the subject resulting in the acute shortage of younger generation of field botanists and taxonomists who are to shoulder the big responsibilities of inventorizing the rich biodiversity in the tropics. However, the situation is not that hopeless. The achievements of Classical Taxonomists during the last 4 decades in inventorization and documentation of the flora of the country is commendable. Today the dimensions and scope of the subject have widened beyond imagination. Floristic taxonomists are sought after by many for taking part in applied aspects such as bio-prospection, new drug discoveries, search for alternate economic plant resources, conservation of  regain its past glory and become one of the challenging disciplines of biology in the 21st century.\\'Abstract: \\'Creeping indigo,Indigofera spicata, while only a minor source of dye, has been much planted for cover, green manure, and erosion control in coffee, tea, and rubber plantations in warm parts of the Old World. It is palatable, even enticing, to most grazing animals. Feeding tests at the University of Florida demonstrated toxicity to rabbits. Pasture trials in Hawaii were promising for 10 yr, but when the plant amounted to 50% of the feed it proved toxic to cattle, sheep, goats, and fowl. The deep-rooted weed, with yard-long, prostrate runners, has become naturalized from Gainesville southward and has heavily invaded many pastures in southern Florida, especially on limestone. High intake is now associated with a fatal CNS syndrome in local horses, formerly linked by some to agricultural pesticides. The leaves and seeds contain indospicine, a toxic amino acid; the toxin was formerly reported to be acid. Some diploid strains in Africa are said to be non-toxic.\\'Abstract: \\'Entomological survey was conducted to know the breeding habitat preference of the forest breeder malaria vector Anopheles baimaii, known earlier as An. dirus species D in the northeastern region of India. Breeding potential of the vector in forest areas was found to be high in water stored in jungle pool (69.84%) followed by elephant footprints with clear water (39.13%) and with turbid water (26.19%), whereas in forest fringe areas, the vector breeding was more prominent in elephant footprints: 65.11% in clear water and 62.5% in turbid water. Although other habitats had shown only low breeding of the vector, all types of habitats were positively correlated with malaria occurrence. Cattle hoof marks and elephant footprint (turbid; explained nearly the same amount of variance. It was observed that deforestation as well as elephant habitat-type destruction had engendered conflicts intensively in fringe areas. Seasonal abundance pattern of this vector was found to vary in forest and forest fringe areas in relation to different habitats. Seasonal abundance of An. baimaii was significantly different in different habitats. The Tukey post hoc comparisons indicated that the abundance of An. baimaii in different habitats was significantly higher in monsoon season than that of premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons. No significant difference was observed between premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons. The findings therefore will eventually help to predict transmission of malaria in targeted area and in formulating an improved malaria control program in the northeastern region of India.\\'Abstract: \\'Fish distribution in relation to environmental variables was investigated in the Matla River of Sundarban estuarine system. A total of 64 brackish water species belonging to 38 families showing tropical and subtropical affinities were obtained upon monthly sampling of The most abundant species were Harpadon nehereus, Gudusia chapra, Coilia neglecta, Coilia ramcarati and Liza parsia. Fish assemblages showed significant seasonal variation as was revealed from MANOVA. MDS ordination plot based on similarity in the fish assemblages revealed that premonsoonal season was distinguishable from the monsoonal and postmonsoonal seasons. Notable differences were also evident between monsoon and postmonsoon. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that salinity, acidity, inorganic phosphate concentration and dissolved oxygen were the most important environmental variables in determining the observed variation in fish assemblages. Seasonal succession of fish populations may be related to differences in life cycle and adaptation to prevalent ecological conditions. The study therefore suggests that environmental variations in terms of changing salinity and dissolved oxygen have significant influence in structuring estuarine piscine community in this region.\\'Abstract: \\'An efficient protocol was established for regeneration of Desmodium motorium via somatic embryogenesis. Embryogenic calli were induced from cotyledon segments old) lacking embryo axis, excised from seedlings grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in combination with 6-benzyladenine (BA) (4.44 and Differentiation of embryogenic calli into globular and heart-shaped somatic embryos was achieved on transfer to hormone-free MS medium. When incubated for on MS medium supplemented with BA 95% of the globular and heart-shaped somatic embryos matured into torpedo and cotyledonary stages with minimum (10%) abnormalities. Modified MS basal medium without hormones and containing half-strength macronutrients and sucrose was suitable for germination of mature somatic embryos. Regenerated plantlets were successfully transferred to earthen pots with survival rate of 50%. Secondary embryogenesis was observed when pre-existing somatic embryos at globular and heart-shaped stages were cultured on MS medium supplemented with various concentrations of BA, adenine sulphate (AdS) and abscisic acid (ABA) individually.\\'Abstract: \\'The complete genome of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) from black pepper was sequenced and compared with CMV isolates from subgroups I and II reported worldwide. Percent identity and phylogenetic analyses clearly indicated that the CMV isolate from black pepper (BP) belongs to subgroup IB. Sequence analyses also showed the presence of a rare deletion of nine nucleotides in the putative methyltransferase domain of 1a gene which was observed only in two more isolates of CMV among one hundred 1a gene sequences of CMV for which sequence information is available in the database. Interestingly this deletion is not present in the black pepper isolate of CMV from China (WN1) and from Indian long pepper that is closely related to black pepper. Percent identity analyses showed that the region (UTR) of the three RNAs of the BP isolate were conserved with 91% identity whereas the of three RNAs showed identity. The level of gene conservation among the subgroups was highest in coat protein and lowest in 2b. The values of nucleotide diversity studies were further consistent with the above data. The ratio of non-synonymous to the synonymous substitution of the five genes of three RNAs was in the order and less than one for all the genes, indicating purifying selection. These clearly reflect that the protein encoded by RNA1 is highly tolerant to amino acid changes followed by that of RNA2 and, RNA3 is the least tolerant correlating to its functional importance.\\'Abstract: \\'Genus Chlorophytum Ker Gawl secures its position chiefly as commercial plants with a wide range of applications, right from pharmaceutical to ornamental, and with a promising economical return also. Few species of this genus are now enlisted under plant due to rash harvesting from its wild habitat, as it is utilized extensively in various industries. Great challenges are associated with its conventional propagation approach. The accomplishment and rapidity in the propagation of few species of Chlorophytum have constantly been a key concern for farmers and researchers. In this regard, in vitro propagation is an efficient technique to triumph over regeneration-associated problems. Available literature was surveyed rigorously to extract the information on pharmacological utilities and recent advancements in in vitro regeneration of genus Chlorophytum. Since 1990s to till now, a number of efforts were made in different aspects of Chlorophytum under both in vitro and ex vitro conditions. Current review intends to provide a comprehensive overview of important properties and biotechnological aspects, viz. bioactive constituents and inherent properties of such as aphrodisiac potential, anti-diabetic, anti-microbial, anti-tumor and anti-oxidant, and in vitro production of genus Chlorophytum. Conclusively, proposed article is an attempt to provide overall update of various studies conducted with members of Chlorophytum genus that will possibly be helpful in proper, fullest and sustainable utilization of this important group.\\'Abstract: \\'The present investigation was carried out to demonstrate the plant morphogenetic potential of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in a commercially important medical plant Canscora decussata. Leaf and nodal explants were used and highest callusing frequency (97.18%) was recorded for leaf explants supplemented with SNP. SNP enhanced multiple shoot formation in both nodal and leaf explants derived callus considerably in the media supplemented with SNP and SNP (98.32 and 96.12%) respectively. The root induction also drastically increased with the supplementation of SNP in combination with IBA. Our results proved that SNP with other growth hormones act synergistically to enhance the in vitro responses including callus, shoot, and root induction. This optimized tissue culture system will be very useful for the mass propagation of C. decussata for both commercial and conservation aspects.\\'Abstract: \\'Adaptive managements on susceptible forested regions not only benefit forest recovery, but also help to improve the stability of soil-degraded area and carbon (C) sequestration. The gain of afforestation on C sink has not been addressed clearly especially in tropical and subtropical regions that will be critical in an era of global warming. Based on the Landsat satellite images, in situ forest survey and archives, we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of C density and storage in a typical conservation area in Changting county in southeastern China, dominated by the pioneer tree Pinus massoniana forest. The results showed that the C density (storage) increased significantly from C C) in 1981 to C C) in 2015 and proved the success of ecological management adopted considering the interactions between local residential livelihoods and the features of local forest ecosystem. In addition, the differences of C density and storage across elevational and slope gradients also narrowed over the past The landscape also gradually shifted from lower C density to higher C density conditions based on the landscape metrics. The ecological-dominated approaches should be put in a high priority for the issue of C sequestration especially in a changing climate.\\'Abstract: \\'The present study was aimed to evaluate adaptive mechanism in terms of seed characters of Phyllanthus amarus collected from ten different locations of Tamil Nadu, India. The adaptive variations among the collected populations were assessed based on the sink and float percentages of the seeds in water, the percentage of seed germination, total protein, carbohydrates and their growth ability such as shoot and root lengths. From this, we observed that the population had a significantly higher germination percentage of sinking seeds that were attributed to its relatively higher carbohydrate and protein contents than the floating seeds. A comparison of the seed population by cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis showed that the Chennai population constituted a single clade that was very distinct from the other nine populations, which were further grouped into two sub-clusters. They exhibited a trend consistent with their geographical proximity. Standardised t tests had revealed that the adaptive diversity of the P. amarus population was significantly affected by the geographic distance altitude minimum temperature and maximum temperature characteristics and geographical conditions were correlated along with 19 bioclimatic variables. In dry season, the rooting ability showed positive correlation, while its protein content exhibited a negative correlation. It is clearly evident from this study that the geographical variables significantly influence the adaptive ability of the P. amarus.\\'Abstract: \\'Coastal resources viz., coral reefs, seagrasses, mangroves, and coastal land features viz., sandy beach, mudflats and salt pan/aquaculture ponds were classified and assessed in the Palk Bay region of the south-east coast of India using IRS LISS III satellite image (1996, 2000, 2002 and 2004). The study recorded an areal coverage of 286.95 ha of reef area during 2004, which is 177.54 ha lesser than that of the reef area of 1996. The reef vegetation composed mainly of seaweeds has gained over 29.44 ha during the same period. Likewise, sand over reef area has also increased alarmingly i.e. 120.34 ha between 1996 and 2004. The seagrass beds of Munaikkadu region of the Palk Bay are comparatively protected and have gained over 7.5 ha between 1996 and 2004. It has been found that both the dense (2.99 ha) and sparse (36.45 ha) mangroves have gained their areal coverage considerably between 1996 and 2004. Whereas in Devipattinam region, many anthropogenic pressures are exerted only on the seagrass resources which has led to the reduction of over 785.5 ha of dense seagrass beds between 1996 and 2004. The study clearly indicated that the resources are under the pressures of low to high threats, especially the coral reefs and seagrasses, if the pressures continue, coastal resources of the Palk Bay may face serious threats of destruction in this part of the Bay in the years to come.\\'Abstract: \\'In the present study, in vitro propagation of tribal endemic medicinal plant, Andrographis lineata has been established using mature nodal explants. High frequency of regeneration (91.4%) was achieved on MS medium containing BA (3.0 mg along with IAA (0.2 mg Strikingly, irrespective of the season and collection period, we observed axillary flower induction and fruit formation from the above in vitro cultures supplemented with BA and NAA. Transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase occurred within 2 months of culture, and importantly was influenced by factors such as sucrose and cytokinins. In vitro-regenerated flowers were morphologically identical to in vivo flowers. Furthermore, our scanning electron microscopic studies revealed that pollen external morphology of both in vitro and in vivo flowers were similar. The flowers self-fertilized and produced fruits in vitro. Elongated shoots rooted well on half-strength MS basal medium, and were successfully acclimatized to the garden conditions. Altogether, our established protocol can be utilized in plant breeding for the purpose of ex situ conservation, quick flowering, and fruit set.\\'Abstract: \\'Traditional homegardens are an important component of the farming systems in many rural communities and have been highlighted considerably due to their sustainability and role in the conservation of biodiversity. However, the functional aspect of the homegardens, which includes the phenological behavior of the As a step in this direction the present study was carried out to determine the phenological behavior of important multipurpose trees in the homegardens of the village of Dargakona, Assam, northeast India. The study revealed the dominance of periodic growth deciduous species from a total of 25 tree species selected for phenological observation. The diversity of multipurpose trees in the homegardens is represented by different plant functional types with different phenological behavior which showed significant changes in their responses to inter-annual climatic variations. The diversity of tree species with different phenological behavior has implications for the temporal partitioning of resources, especially during periods of scarcity, thereby resulting in efficient utilization of resources such as water. Also the diverse phenological behavior plays an important role in regulating the food supply for the herbivore population and the year-round availability of products, and such information can be useful in the selection of species for integration into other agroforestry systems which can be sustainable in the long run.\\'Abstract: \\'Description of biodiversity is often cited as one of the most important actions necessary for conservation programs. There are more than 600 species of stingless bees spread over the Tropical regions of the world; though for various species, little is known about their biology and taxonomy. We sampled bees from feral colonies from various regions of India and compared them using wing morphology. The results of population analysis of the patterns of wing venation, using geometric morphometric techniques, suggested the existence of at least two phenotypic clusters within our samples of the so-called Tetragonula iridipennis complex. These findings were supported by other features, including differences in nest architecture. This helps to explain the patterns of variability found in stingless bees in India and also will be valuable for conservation planning.\\'Abstract: \\'The herbaceous vine, twisted birthwort Aristolochia contorta Bunge, is a rare species listed in the Red Data Book of Primorsky krai (2008). On the northern boundary of its range (south of the Russian Far East), the species is represented by small isolated populations confined to the river drainages. Using allozyme analysis, genetic variation of nine natural populations of A. contorta (247 accessions), which represented the main part of the species range in Russia, was examined. The values of genetic variation indices (P = 22.7%; A = 1.28; H o = 0.129; H e = 0.101) were low and comparable with the data obtained for other rare plants. The proportion of unique genotypes (G/N) and genotypic diversity index (D) ranged from 0.32 to 0.64 and from 0.60 to 0.98, respectively. This means that A. contorta is characterized by sexual and asexual reproduction. Moreover, the ratio between these types of reproduction varied among the populations. Complete absence of inbreeding and excess of heterozygotes (F IS = which was low probable in case of free mating, was observed. Evidently, clonal growth and (or) apomixis enables the species to maintain certain level of heterozygosity despite of small population sizes and non-regular gene exchange.\\'Abstract: \\'India is the tenth most forested nation with of forest and tree cover occupying 23.4% of its geographical area. their intrinsic of carbon sequestration and storage in the front line of climate change mitigation strategies. This paper provides estimates of sequestered carbon in forest and tree cover for the years 1995 and 2005 as per the IPCC good practice guidelines method. It is based on the primary data for the soil carbon pool through collecting soil samples by laying out quadrats across the country and secondary data for the growing stock of all forest and tree cover in the country. The estimates are compared with current and future projected emissions. It is found that conservation policies have resulted in increase of the forest carbon stocks from 6244.8 to 6621.6 Mt with an annual increment of 37.7 Mt of the carbon from 1995 to 2005. Annual CO2 removal by the forests is enough to neutralise 9.3% of the 2000 level emissions. Continued removals by the forest and tree cover would offset 6.5 and 4.9% of projected annual emissions in 2010 and 2020 respectively. Economically, the annual value of this forest carbon in the international market is about US $188 million. The result is of use in the REDD and REDD+ context for India.\\'Abstract: \\' Exacum bicolor, an endemic and endangered medicinal plant, belongs to the family Gentianaceae. A rapid protocol has been developed for efficient multiple shoot induction by testing nodal explants on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with various cytokinins. The cytokinins 6-benzyladenine (BA), 6-furfurylaminopurine (Kn), 2-isopentenyladenine (2-iP) and zeatin (Zn) were used individually and in combination at different concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, The maximum number of shoots per explant) as well as their fresh weight and dry weight were obtained with Kn. After the multiple shoots from agar culture were subcultured into liquid medium containing the same growth regulator combinations. After of liquid culture, the best treatment had about tenfold increase in shoot number per explant). The fresh weight and dry weight were highest with full strength MS medium supplemented with 3% sucrose and containing Kn. Maximum root development was observed after with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) supplementation. Regenerated plants were successfully transferred to pots containing coco peat:perlite mixture and showed a 75% survival rate. Genetic fidelity of in vitro plantlets compared to mother plant were assessed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers. All the regenerated plants were genetically identical to their mother plant, showing no detectable genetic variation in the regenerated plantlets. Thus, this protocol could be successfully used for mass multiplication and germplasm conservation of E. bicolor.\\'Abstract: \\'Rapid extinction of species is one of the most serious ecological problems faced by humanity today. Species are disappearing at a pace unprecedented in the history of the planet putting the very future of life at risk. The irony is that the root of the crisis is another species, Homo sapiens rather than some physical events that is poised to threaten its own survival. This article gives a brief introduction to the crisis, its consequences and possible mitigation strategies.\\'Abstract: \\'Large parts of the remaining tropical moist forests of South-east Asia are encroached at their margins by selective logging, rattan harvesting and the establishment of small agroforest plantations under the rainforest canopy. These slight to heavy disturbances affect aboveground forest structure by reducing wood biomass and canopy cover; however, they may also have a profound impact on the belowground compartment. In a lower montane moist forest of Central Sulawesi, we studied the profile totals of fine root biomass (FRBtot, roots until of soil depth) and of fine root necromass (FRNtot), the vertical distribution of fine root mass, and the fine root live/dead ratio by root coring in 12 forest stands that represented a gradient in forest use (or disturbance) intensity (forest use type A: undisturbed natural forest, B and C: slightly or moderately disturbed forests with selective timber extraction, D: heavily disturbed cacao agroforest systems under a remaining rainforest cover; each forest types being replicated three times). FRBtot decreased significantly from forest A to the disturbed B, C and D forests, and reached less than 60% of the FRBtot value of A in the agroforest systems D. A similar decrease with increasing disturbance intensity was found for FRNtot. Forest disturbance intensity had no significant influence on the vertical distribution of fine root biomass in the profiles. According to correlation and principal components analyses, fractional canopy cover was the most important factor influencing FRBtot and FRNtot, whereas diameter at breast height, stand basal area, stem density, soil pH and base saturation had only a minor or no influence on root mass. A reduction in canopy cover from 90% (forest type A) to 75% (types C and D) was associated with a reduction in FRBtot by about 45% which indicates that timber extraction leads not only to canopy gaps but to corresponding in the soil as well. We conclude that forest encroachment that is widespread in large parts of South-east remaining rainforests significantly reduces tree fine root biomass and associated carbon sequestration, even if it is conducted at moderate intensities only.\\'Abstract: \\'Understanding the spatial patterns of species distribution is essential to characterize the structure of communities, to optimize species inventories and to evaluate the impact of biotic and abiotic variables. Here we describe the spatial structure of the distribution of leaf litter ant species, and of biotic factors that could explain it, in a subtropical semi-deciduous forest of the Argentinian Chaco, characterized by a dense understorey of shrubs and terrestrial bromeliads. Environmental variables (leaf litter quantity and ground bromeliad density) were measured and ants were collected in quadrats distributed along two transects at intervals of Overall 87 species were collected. Sixteen positive associations and a single negative association were observed between the 11 most frequent species taken pair-wise. Our results suggest that the spatial distribution of leaf litter ants was determined at two different scales. At a small scale (period below a periodic spatial structure, likely due to intraspecific competition, produced a succession of peaks of abundance separated by gaps. At a larger scale (period around periodically distributed environmental factors induced aggregates of colonies of species responding positively to these factors. A high quantity of leaf litter and, to a lesser extent, a high density of ground bromeliads promoted a high density and a high species richness of ants. Numerically dominant ants being generally positively associated, interspecific competition was apparently weak. All ant species whose abundance was correlated with an environmental factor were not completely spatially structured by it. This suggests that some other factors, such as intraspecific competition, may have counter-effects.\\'Abstract: \\'The present study estimates the net emission of carbon from the forest sector in India. For the reference year (1986), the gross emission from deforestation in that year, plus committed emissions from deforestation in the preceding years, is estimated to be 64 106 t of C. The carbon sequestration (or net woody biomass accumulation in trees for long-term storage) from the area brought under tree plantations and the existing forest area under forest succession is estimated to offset the gross carbon emission in India, leading to no net emissions of carbon from the forest sector. Medium-term projections for India (for the year 2011) show that under a as scenario at current rates of afforestation, projected carbon emissions would continue to be balanced by sequestration.\\'Abstract: \\'In this study, we used fire count datasets derived from Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) satellite to characterize spatial patterns in fire occurrences across highly diverse geographical, vegetation and topographic gradients in the Indian region. For characterizing the spatial patterns of fire occurrences, observed fire point patterns were tested against the hypothesis of a complete spatial random (CSR) pattern using three different techniques, the quadrat analysis, nearest neighbor analysis and K function. Hierarchical nearest neighboring technique was used to depict the of fire incidents. Of the different states, highest fire counts were recorded in Madhya Pradesh (14.77%) followed by Gujarat (10.86%), Maharastra (9.92%), Mizoram (7.66%), Jharkhand (6.41%), etc. With respect to the vegetation categories, highest number of fires were recorded in agricultural regions (40.26%) followed by tropical moist deciduous vegetation (12.72), dry deciduous vegetation (11.40%), abandoned slash and burn secondary forests (9.04%), tropical montane forests (8.07%) followed by others. Analysis of fire counts based on elevation and slope range suggested that maximum number of fires occurred in low and medium elevation types and in very low to low-slope categories. Results from three different spatial techniques for spatial pattern suggested clustered pattern in fire events compared to CSR. Most importantly, results from K statistic suggested that fire events are highly clustered at a lag-distance of 125 miles. Hierarchical nearest neighboring clustering technique identified significant clusters of fire in different states in northeast and central India. The implications of these results in fire management and mitigation were discussed. Also, this study highlights the potential of spatial point pattern statistics in environmental monitoring and assessment studies with special reference to fire events in the Indian region.\\'Abstract: \\'This study is based on a remarkable seventeenth-century Malay court chronicle, in which the rulers issue injunctions on their death-beds against cultivating pepper (Piper nigrum Piperaceae) for the colonial trade. The rulers say that pepper cultivation will lead to expensive food stuffs, malice, government disorder, pretensions on the part of the subject peoples, and inevitably the destruction of the kingdom. The of pepper cultivation is likened, in an indigenous metaphor, to having a flourishing banana tree in front of gate. Analysis of historic as well as contemporary evidence from Borneo suggests that this is a remarkably astute analysis of the relations of production in pepper cultivation, especially in the transition from small-scale household cultivation to larger-scale production with state involvement. This analysis demonstrates the potential value of historic, indigenous texts for the study of economic plants, and it also shows the value of historical depth for understanding contemporary issues.\\'Abstract: \\' Vigna radiata (L.)

The present review deals with the data available on plant regeneration of this species. Both shoot-tip multiplication and somatic embryogenesis have been compared on the basis of retrospective as well as recent reports. Molecular markers, especially random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), have been used to compare results obtained from in vitro and in vivo studies on various species ofVigna.

The observed pattern of throughfall ionic composition in the study are 3 3 4 + The sum of cation studied is and that of anions is showing cation excess of The cations, namely Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, and NH 4 + , made a contribution of about 67% of the total ion strength, where as anion comprising of SO 4 , NO 3 , and HCO 3  contributed 33%. The chief acidic components were (12%) and HCO 3  (8%), while the presence of SO 4  (5%) and NO 3  (6%), respectively. Percentage contribution of bole to total aboveground biomass was in comparison to of leaf biomass, of branch biomass and of bark biomass. There was high and significant variation in the total aboveground biomass produced at different sites. The aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in these sites ranged between 2.09 and The base cations and nitrogen immobilization was found to be maximum in bole. The net annual uptake of the base cations varied from 306.85 to and of nitrogen from 68.27 to The critical appraisal of soil showed that cation exchange capacity lied between 18.37 and (p+) The base saturation percentage of soil was as high as 82.43% in Senkot, whereas in Kalusidh it was just 44.28%. The local temperature corrected base cation weathering rates based on soil mineralogy, parent material class, and texture class varied from 484.15 to showing a weak potentiality of the system to buffer any incoming acidity and thus providing restricted acid neutralizing capacity to keep the ecosystem stable under increased future deposition scenarios in near future. The appreciable BS of the soil indicates the presence of intense nutrient phytorecycling forces within this climate and atmospheric deposition in replenishing base cations in the soil, which includes intrinsic soil-forming processes, i.e., weathering. The highest value of critical load for acidity was and the lowest was The calculated value of the minimum critical loads for nitrogen varied from 69.77 to whereas the maximum nitrogen critical load ranged between 2,992.63 and The minimum and the maximum critical loads of sulfur ranged between 2,130.49 and and 2,250.58 and respectively. The values of exceedance of sulfur and nitrogen were negative, implying that in the current scenario Sal forests of the Doon valley are well protected from acidification.\\'Country Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Solvakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States of America.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: growing self-sufficiency in food production and food stocks since independence suggest that soils have the capacity to produce. Therefore, a review of Indian soils and their capacity to sequester carbon; and the factors favouring C sequestration under different land uses is in order. Several researchers, especially those in The National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning and the International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics monitored the changes in soil organic (SOC) and inorganic (SIC) carbon as influenced by land use in the Indo-Gangetic Alluvial Plains and black soil regions between 1980 and 2005. The results showed an increase in SOC stocks due to turnover of greater plant biomass into the soil. Results of long-term fertilizer experiments with rice-based double or triple cropping systems indicate capacity to store greater C, and maintain higher C in passive pools and that active fraction of soil C can be used as an indicator of soil health. The inclusion of active pool/labile SOC is expected to improve the performance of Century eco-system model in predicting SOC changes under different climatic conditions. Greenhouse gas emissions from the tropical Indian soils (both zeolitic and non-zeolitic) do not seem to contribute significantly to the global warming potential. The application NPK plus FYM emerged as a cost effective technology for Indian farmers. In view of the potential of C sequestration by major zeolitic and non-zeolitic soils, the present SOC stock of about can be further increased.\\'Abstract: \\'We developed a method for in vitro regeneration of Garcinia xanthochymus (yellow mangosteen) from matured seed segments. Multiple shoots were induced on woody plant (WP) medium supplemented with cytokinins. An average of 11 shoots per explant were regenerated from mature seed segments on WP medium containing 6-benzylaminopurine. Histological analysis revealed that hypodermal cells of seed segments were initially involved in active division, which later developed into meristemoids, subsequently leading to the formation of shoot buds. Shoot elongation was achieved by repeated subculturing of seed explants in shoot regeneration medium. Rooting of shoots was achieved on WP medium supplemented with indole-3-butyric acid or acetic acid. Plantlets were transplanted to pots containing soil: compost (1:1) and survival rate wasAbstract: \\'Earlier studies on Hanuman langurs (Presbytis entellus) around Jodhpur found them entirely vegetarian (Mohnot, 1974;Winkler, 1988). However, recent observations in the open scrub forests of Jodhpur reveal that scale insects may constitute a regular part of their diet and that insectivory is particularly prevalent in the monsoon months July September. The insect eating in this habitat seems to support the hypothesis ofHamilton andBusse (1978).\\'Abstract: \\'Geofractures play a crucial role in environmental degradation and environmental pollution. Such geofractures were interpreted using LANDSAT and IRS 1A imagery and integrated with seismic, erosion and groundwater-chemistry data. The study shows that mostly the N-S and NE-SW trending fractures are prone to seismicity and pollutant migration while NE-SW and WNW-ESE trending faults are prone to soil erosion. The study further shows that mostly the Quaternary fractures/lineaments and the Quaternary reactivated Precambrian fractures are having a dominant control over such phenomena. On the basis of such studies, suggestions are made to take adequate care while dealing with such regions for resource exploitation and developmental purposes.\\'Abstract: \\'In the present study, post-mortem was conducted on a female elephant aged about died at Rajeev Gandhi National Park, Hunsur, Mathigoodu Elephant Camp, Karnataka state. The animal suffered with diarrhoea, anorexia, dehydration and was unable to walk for about one week before death and was treated with antibiotics and fluid therapy for three days. The post-mortem examination revealed that, the gastric mucosa was severely congested, hyperaemic and numerous stomach bots attached to the mucosa. The bots were recovered from the gastric mucosa and processed for species identification. The posterior spiracles of the bots showed three longitudinal parallel slits in each spiracle, the abdominal segments had a row of belt like triangular shaped spines and the anterior end had two powerful oral hooks with cephalo-pharyngeal skeleton. Based on the above said morphological characters, the bots were identified as Cobboldia elephantis. This seems to be the first report of C. elephantis in free range wild elephant from Karnataka state.\\'Abstract: \\'The transpiration rates and acclimation to water and temperature ofPorcellionides pruinosus Brandt andPorcellio laevis Latreille, the common terrestrial isopods occurring in and around Trivandrum, India, were studied. Transpiration rates in different temperatures (24 to were higher in both the species during the first 15 exposure when compared to 1-hour duration. Previous acclimation to different humidity and temperature conditions affected the transpiration rates in both the species and lower rates of transpiration occurred in isopods acclimated to dry conditions and higher temperatures.

The calli regenerated shoots on subculturing in the MS medium with 6-benzylaminopurine which was the optimum concentration for multiplication. Rooting was observed in MS medium supplemented with acid indole-3-butyric acid and on MS basal medium free of plant growth regulators. The rooted plants were hardened and transferred to field with 80% survival.\\'Abstract: \\'A new triggering mechanism for deep convection based on the heated condensation framework (HCF) is implemented into the National Centers for Environmental Prediction climate forecast system version 2 (CFSv2). The new trigger is added as an additional criterion in the simplified scheme for deep convection. Seasonal forecasts are performed to evaluate the influence of the new triggering mechanism in the representation of the Indian summer monsoon in the CFSv2. The HCF trigger improves the seasonal representation of precipitation over the Indian subcontinent. The new triggering mechanism leads to a significant, albeit relatively small, improvement in the bias of seasonal precipitation totals. In addition, the new trigger improves the representation of the seasonal precipitation cycle including the monsoon onset, and the probability distribution of precipitation intensities. The mechanism whereby the HCF improves convection over India seems to be related not only to a better representation of the background state of atmospheric convection but also to an increase in the frequency in which SAS is triggered. As a result, there was an increase in convective precipitation over India favored by the availability of moist convective instability. The increase in precipitation intensity leads to a reduction in the dry bias.\\'Abstract: \\'A limnological study of seventeen man-made lakes has been made. Thermal features showed absence of stable thermal stratification. Cognisable thermocline did not exist. The South-Western reservoirs with low nutrient and salt content were very poor in productivity, but the high alkaline reservoirs were also not very productive. Some reservoirs with lower alkalinity, hardness and total solids developed algal blooms and were highly productive. Bhavanisagar and Stanley reservoirs with optimal levels of dissolved salts and alkalinity-hardness were fairly productive. Reservoirs with organic soils were better in productivity than those with higher silica content (Hope Lake, Poondi Reservoir, Vaigai etc.) Dissolved oxygen depletion in the bottom was characteristic of productive waters. Total oxygen depletion occurred in some of them but in a few depletion was rare and not of great severity. Klinograde curves were characteristic of productive reservoirs. Even when the bottom waters were low in or were devoid of dissolved oxygen the outflow from this level picked up oxygen within a short distance of 100 m. Effect of water replacement on plankton production is discussed. Primary production in the reservoirs has been compared and discussed. It is the silt-laden turbid waters that are poor in production. Water releases could be manipulated to assist spawning of fishes and for amelioration of pollution downstream.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'The coexistence of multifaceted geodynamical situation in the Northeastern Indian Ocean (Bay of Bengal) lithosphere inspires to investigate the origin, present day orientation and gravitational stability of its basement, crust and lithospheric structures. The origin, evolution and the present day configuration of these structures such as the northward down dipping of the Bay of Bengal basement and its lithosphere, the Moho of the ridge, the formation of the Ninetyeast ridge median graben and ridge normal faults and their interaction with slow convergence and stress diffusion processes in the north Andaman trench, remain conspicuous. In this paper, we explain the above mentioned processes and the existence of the Bay of Bengal basement features through plausible tectonic scenarios that related with past time dynamics of the Indian Plate prior to the India-Eurasia collision and lithospheric thermal perturbation due to the Ninetyeast Ridge magmatism.\\'Abstract: \\'Gene sequences mediating sexual reproduction are more divergent within and between closely related species. Microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers are valuable molecular tools for analysis of genetic variability, phylogeny, and also for identifying sex at seedling stage in dioecious plant species. Calamus travancoricus Bedd. ex. Becc. and Calamus nagbettai R.R.Fernald & Dey are economically important rattan species. The dioecious nature of the Calamus spp. limits its breeding and cultivation. The sex of rattans can only be identified after attaining reproductive maturity which ranges from 5 to A study was carried out in this background and 9 putative sex-specific PCR products were identified as sex markers for C. travancoricus and C. nagbettai and sequenced by Sanger method. The sequence homology search revealed occurrence of identical sequences in many plant species across different families indicating the conserved nature of the sequences. However, these sequences were not present in opposite sex in the studied species, indicating divergent evolution favoring sex determination. Annotation of these sequences revealed that most of these are mediating sexual reproduction by and large. An adequate sex ratio is to be maintained for these dioecious palms in natural habitat for producing offsprings having equal gene complements for continual evolution and sustainable utilization. Developing scientific management strategies and improved utilization of canes could help to generate employment locally and thus contribute to the socioeconomics sustainably.\\'Abstract: \\'The effect of nitrogen addition and weed management on fibre properties of wood from 6.5-year-old Eucalyptus grandis and E. tereticornis from intensively managed short-rotation plantations were investigated. Trees for analyses were sampled from plots with zero nitrogen input plots with high level nitrogen input plots from which weed growth was not removed throughout the rotation and plots from which weeds were removed periodically Fibre characteristics were evaluated on wood samples collected from base, breast height, 50, 75 and of merchantable bole height of trees. Though N input and weed management improved tree growth significantly irrespective of species, the treatment effects did not cause any significant change in fibre characteristics such as fibre length, fibre diameter, lumen width and wall thickness. Longest and widest fibres were observed at the outer most radial portion of wood in all cases. In general, within tree fibre length varied significantly along the radial direction of wood. Fibre diameter, lumen width and wall thickness lacked any specific pattern between species and treatments. Runkel ratio and felting and flexibility coefficients values showed high pulping quality of wood irrespective of species and treatments. The study concluded that the fibre properties that influence pulpwood quality of Eucalyptus have not been affected by silvicultural practices, like fertilizer input and weed management, aimed at improving productivity of short-rotation eucalypt plantations.\\'Abstract: \\'The present investigation deals with limnobiotic status of the Almatti reservoir from February, 2003 to January, 2005. The study revealed that there exists a fluctuations of the physical factors viz., rainfall, humidity, air and water temperature, pH and electrical conductivity (EC), and chemical factors viz., dissolved oxygen (DO), free carbon dioxide, total alkalinity, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, chloride, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, bicarbonate and total dissolved solids (TDS). From the data it was also apparent that correlations between the physico-chemical factors and dynamics of phytoplankton could be seen. The simple correlation coefficient test revealed that the cyanophytes number was positively correlated with DO, nitrate, phosphate and negatively significant with total hardness, total alkalinity, EC, calcium, magnesium, sulphate, bicarbonate and TDS. They are inversely correlated with pH, chloride, rainfall and humidity. Bacillariphyceae are correlated with total alkalinity, bicarbonates, magnesium and TDS, whereas inverse correlation was found with rainfall, humidity, pH and phosphate. Desmids showed positive correlation with nitrates, while it was inversely correlated with chloride, rainfall and humidity. Dinophytes density was positively correlated with total alkalinity, EC, total hardness, calcium, bicarbonate, while it showed inverse correlation with rainfall, humidity and phosphate. However, it is obvious that the absence of significant difference between sampling stations for all these parameters in the Almatti reservoir indicated fairly homogeneous conditions and the water quality is also found to be homogeneous.\\'Abstract: \\'Land use and land cover (LULC) change have considerable influence on ecosystem services. Assessing change in ecosystem services due to LULC change at different spatial and temporal scales will help to identify suitable management practices for sustaining ecosystem productivity and maintaining the ecological balance. The objective of this study was to investigate variations in ecosystem services in response to LULC change over in four agro-climatic zones (ACZ) of eastern India using satellite imagery for the year 1989, 1996, 2005, 2011 (Landsat TM) and 2016 (Landsat 8 OLI). The satellite images were classified into six LULC classes, agriculture land, forest, waterbody, wasteland, built-up, and mining area. During the study period (1989 to 2016), forest cover reduced by 5.2%, 13.7%, and 3.6% in Sambalpur, Keonjhar, and Kandhamal districts of Odisha, respectively. In Balasore, agricultural land reduced by 17.2% due to its conversion to built-up land. The value of ecosystem services per unit area followed the order of waterbodies > agricultural land > forests. A different set of indicators, e.g., by explicitly including diversity, could change the rank between these land uses, so the temporal trends within a land use are more important than the absolute values. Total ecosystem services increased by US$ (50.74%), US$ (98.52%), US$ (61.64%), and US$ (46.13%) for Sambalpur, Balasore, Kandhamal, and Keonjhar, respectively.\\'Abstract: \\'It is proposed, on the basis of evidence from geological history and paleoclimatology, that annual grasses and legumes did not appear as significant components of the vegetation of Asia until the Neothermal, some 11,000 years B.P. The new combination of environmental factors which then became operative induced a widespread physiological and genetic change from a perennial to an annual habit in ecoclimatic zones in which annual types of ancestral perennials had not earlier occurred in any number. The annual prototypes of the Asian cereals and grain legumes therefore became rather suddenly and abundantly available to primitive man in his still biological ecosystems. Once this botanical revolution had occurred throughout the isoxerothermic zones around the inner cores of Asia, progress towards what came to be called civilizations, based on increasingly economic agricultural ecosystems involving cultivation and domestication of crops, followed in a gradual step-by-step manner.\\'Abstract: \\'This study provides an analysis of biotic change in successive mammalian communities during the last 1.8 million years of the Cretaceous Ma) from the Hell Creek Formation in Garfield County, Montana. Results show changes in relative abundances of species, mean individual body size, and to some extent taxonomic composition through the Hell Creek Formation. These results are interpreted as mammalian responses to fluctuating temperatures during the latest Cretaceous. By contrast, the extinction of mammalian species at or near the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary cannot be explained by the coincident cooling interval alone. At the scale of temporal resolution available, these fossil data are inconsistent with an extended gradual pattern of extinction (linear-response) and are most consistent with either a non-linear response pattern for the K-T extinction, resulting from the accumulated stress of multiple long- and short-term environmental perturbations (e.g., climate change, sea-level regression, volcanism, an extraterrestrial impact), or a single, short-term cause (an extraterrestrial impact).\\'Abstract: \\'This study assesses the potential impacts of future global warming on the carbon budget of terrestrial ecosystems across monsoon Asia using the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP) dataset. We used simulation results of two emission pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5), climate projections of five climate models, and seven terrestrial biome models to analyze the changes in net primary production and carbon stocks in the South, Southeast, and East Asian subregions during the period The simulations indicated that by the end of the 21st century, net primary production would increase by and ecosystem carbon storage would increase by Pg C. The clearest climatic impacts were found when using the adaptation-oriented emission scenario (RCP8.5), which assumes a greater CO2 increase and a larger change in climatic conditions. Substantial disparities in temporal trajectories and spatial patterns were found in the estimated changes, owing to the uncertainties in the emission scenarios, climate projections, and ecosystem models. We attempted to derive consistent patterns throughout the simulations to specify potential hotspots of climatic impacts (e.g., soil carbon change in the southern Tibetan Plateau). Finally, we discuss changes to the climatic characteristics in the study region (e.g., a change in the rainy season), the implications for ecosystem services, and the need for collaborative field monitoring studies.\\'Abstract: \\'1. Kaur S, Singhal VK, Kumar P (2010) Male meiotic studies in some plants of Polypetalae from Dalhousie hills (Himachal Pradesh)Cytologia75Abstract: \\'A potential impact of climate change in the south Asian context in general and the Indian subcontinent in particular is an increase in rainfall, in some areas up to 50%. Using an extensive information base available on the dynamics of landscape structure and function of the northeastern hill areas of India, scenarios on landscape changes, as an adaptation to climate change, have been constructed. Climate change would impose a variety of stresses on sustainable livelihood of the inhabitants of the rain-forested areas through stresses on ecosystem function. It is concluded that appropriate management strategies for natural forests and plantation forestry should go hand in hand with a comprehensive rural ecosystem rehabilitation plan.\\'Abstract: \\'Young leaf segments from plants growing both in vivo and in vitro were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with auxins [naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)], cytokinins [kinetin (KN) and N6-benzyladenine (BA)] and coconut liquid endosperm (CW). The explants from mature leaves did not show any growth and turned necrotic, while those obtained from juvenile leaves growing in vitro developed protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) at their cut surfaces within wk depending on the growth medium. An optimum of 18 PLBs developed from leaf explants on medium supplemented with 2.0 mg (8.87 BA. Upon subculture in basal MS medium, the PLBs differentiated into plantlets within wk. The resulting plantlets were successfully transferred to vermiculite initially and subsequently to potting mixture; 84% of the plantlets survived after 3 mo. of transplantation.\\'Abstract: \\'This paper explores the influence over time of past policies on attitudes towards the use of forestland in Bangladesh. The discourses of the attitudes of people were captured from the observed social tradition towards forest resources. Forests were reserved systematically and solely through the Forest Department. The conservation processes were not participatory, and rights and tenure were strictly controlled. People were socially excluded and alienated from the forest, and the socio-political factors stimulated negative attitudes among people. Forests were considered to be government property, and therefore managing forests was the responsibility of the government. People only used forest resources to meet their own requirements, either with formal permission or illegally. This situation continued even after the independence of Bangladesh in 1971. As a result, the forests of Bangladesh have been degraded heavily in recent decades.\\'Abstract: \\'Seeds of an exquisite orchid, Rhynchostylis retusa, germinated in vitro on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different concentrations of coconut milk (CM). Of the different concentrations of CM employed for seed germination, 15% gave optimum response. On this medium a maximum of 93% cultures produced seedlings after inoculation. Individual seedlings with a length of about were subcultured on MS medium supplemented with various concentrations of 6-benzylaminopurine (BA) and acetic acid (NAA), with or without activated charcoal (AC), for further growth. Seedling growth was maximum on MS medium supplemented with BA, and AC. Here a maximum seedling length of was observed after 1 month of culture. The seedlings were subcultured on MS medium supplemented with kinetin (Kn) or thidiazuron (TDZ), in the presence or absence of AC, for multiple shoot induction. A maximum multiple shoot number of 8.2 was observed on MS medium supplemented with TDZ in the presence of AC. The shoots were rooted on MS medium supplemented with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and successfully transplanted to soil. Of the 45 plantlets transferred to soil 40 survived. The reproducible protocol standardized here will enable rapid propagation and conservation of this precious orchid.\\'Abstract: \\'Studies on phenology and reproductive biology were carried out in 15 populations of Rauvolfia serpentina (L.)

It has been an age-old method to adopt the inter-basin water transfers (IBTs) for alleviating and even resolving the urgent demand of the water-deficient areas. A number of countries have made attempts and have achieved enormous benefits. However, IBTs inevitably involve the redistribution of water resources in relevant basins and may cause changes of the ecological environment in different basins. Such changes are two-sided, namely, the positive impacts, including adding new basins for water-deficient areas, facilitating water cycle, improving meteorological conditions in the recipient basins, mitigating ecological water shortage, repairing the damaged ecological system, and preserving the endangered wild fauna and flora, as well as the negative impacts, including salinization and aridification of the donor basins, damage to the ecological environment of the donor basins and the both sides of the conveying channel system, increase of water consumption in the recipient basins, and spread of diseases, etc. Because IBTs have enormous ecological risk, it is necessary to comprehensively analyze the inter-basin water balance relationship, coordinate the possible conflicts and environmental quality problems between regions, and strengthen the argumentation of the ecological risk of water transfer and eco-compensation measures. In addition, there are some effective alternative measures for IBTs, such as attaching importance to water cycle, improving water use efficiency, developing sea water desalination, and rainwater harvesting technology, etc.\\'Abstract: \\'A micropropagation protocol was developed for Celastrus paniculatus, a vulnerable medicinal plant. Cultures were initiated from nodal explants collected from young shoots of a 12-year-old plant in MS basal medium. An average of five shoots were produced in MS medium supplemented with benzyl adenine (BA) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) after two subculture cycles with a 30-day interval. Continuous subculture in the same medium for three more cycles resulted in reduction of the number of multiple shoots (2 or 3 shoots), vitrification of the shoots, and callus formation. Vitrification of cultures could be overcome by the use of MS medium supplemented with lower concentrations of BA and NAA Among the various rooting trials, ex vitro rooting of shoots with simultaneous hardening was most efficient. The method standardized in the present study is simple, as it eliminated separate steps for in vitro rooting and hardening. Qualitative chemical similarity of the tissue culture regenerants with the mother plant was confirmed using high performance thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) profiling.\\'Abstract: \\'A protocol is described for rapid multiplication of Piper barberi Gamble (Piperaceae) through shoot tip and nodal explant cultures. Nodal explants with a single axillary meristem showed three times better response with respect to shoot proliferation when compared to shoot tip explants. The best shoot proliferation response of nodal explants was observed with a cytokinin combination of N6-benzyladenine (4.43 and kinetin (2.32 with 88% bud break. The number of shoot initials (2.4) produced per nodal explant was twice the number of shoot initials (1.2) per shoot tip. An average of adventitious shoots were observed from the proximal end of the internodal explants on Mursashige and Skoog (1962) (Ms) basal medium supplemented with N6-benzyladenine (2.22 and kinetin (0.46 A multiplication rate of 82 shoots per explant could be achieved after 9 wk of subculturing. The in vitro shoots were rooted on one-half and one-quarter MS basal medium. The shoots rooted on one-quarter MS in the dark produced eight roots with an average root length of 3.36 cm and 98% survival. These plants were transferred to the field with a survival rate of 75%.\\'L.\\'Abstract: \\'Salacia chinensis L., a perennial medicinal plant, is well-known for its well-documented anti-diabetic properties. The daily growing demand in pharmaceutical industry is stimulating the conservation and wide-ranging production of the plant using plant tissue culture techniques (micropropagation). In the present study, the plants generated by direct micropropagation from nodal explants were assessed using fluorescently labeled RAPD (FRAPD) primers. Although standard RAPD primer bands in agarose gel showed genetic stability, using FRAPD analysis in genetic DNA sequencer as a novel strategy showed more accurate and reliable method has indicated by the evidence in 5% genetic variation. Antioxidant and anti-diabetic activities of micropropagated plants versus mother plant were examined using DPPH, FRAP, and assays. The results showed that the micropropagated plants, which are able to produce higher amount of secondary metabolites than the mother plant, possess higher in vitro antioxidant and anti-diabetic properties.\\'Abstract: \\'The present work deals with collection, handling, utilization, and management of the waste flowers that are coming out of the temples in Coimbatore District, Tamilnadu, India. An attempt has been made to provide a current situation and complete analysis of temple waste flowers (TWFs) with suggestions and recommendations. As a part of Clean India, Clean and Green Kovai (Green Coimbatore) mission, this paper gives an idea to reduce the volume of temple waste flowers by converting into activated carbon by direct pyrolysis process and chemical activation with sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid process, respectively. The products were analyzed and compared based on the results of physicochemical parameters including pH, conductivity, moisture content, ash content, volatile content, fixed carbon, bulk density, porosity, specific gravity, water soluble matter, acid soluble matter, iodine number, methylene blue number, yield, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (SBET) surface area. The structure, surface morphology, and chemical compositions of carbon were determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FeSEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), respectively. From the comparison of results, the activated carbon produced from temple waste flowers by direct pyrolysis process is fairly better due to low moisture content, low ash content, better yield, and higher surface area.\\'Abstract: \\'A critical first step in establishing biosphere the Man and Biosphere Programme of to generate baseline information for future courses of action. The present study aims to assess the structure and composition of with anthropogenic pressures mounting on these forests in the buffer zone of one such biosphere Pachmarhi biosphere reserve of India. The quadrat method was employed for sampling vegetation, and information on anthropogenic pressures was collected by conducting interviews with local people and forest officials and collecting it from secondary sources. A total of 39 tree species were sampled in 82 quadrats; of these 26 tree species were in standing stage, 25 in sapling, and 35 in seedling. Chloroxylon swietenia emerged as the most dominant tree species having highest importance value index, followed by Tectona grandis, Terminalia tomentosa, and Hardwickia binata. Nine tree species and their saplings, including Sterculia urens and Terminalia arjuna, were exploited so badly that they were only found in the seedlings stage. The unavailability of standing trees of 12 important tree species including Aegle marmelos and Phyllanthus emblica indicates the intensity and gravity of anthropogenic pressures on these important tree species. If the present anthropogenic pressure continues, which has inhibited the regeneration of several tree species, then substantial negative ecological and societal consequences can be expected.\\'Abstract: \\'Alborz Mountains host Caspian Hyrcanian forest ecoregion along the northern slopes and forest steppe ecoregion in highlands. Hyrcanian forest covers the southeastern part of Caucasus biodiversity hotspot and is of great biogeographic importance. Altitudinal pattern and correlation between woody species biodiversity (DIV), forest structure ((stem density (DEN), mean basal area (MBA) and mean height class (MHC)) and disturbance (DIS) were explored along 2,400 m altitudinal gradient in Hyrcanian relict forest, Central Alborz Mountains. Vegetation changes from lowland forest (LoF) to midaltitude forest (MiF) and montane forest (MoF) in this area. The altitudinal gradient was divided into twelve 200 m elevational belts. Point centered quarter method (PCQM) with 96 sampling points and 83 vegetation samples by plot method (PM) were used to record field data. Shannon-Wiener index and Pearson coefficient were used for diversity and correlation analysis. The results showed that DEN decreased linearly, MBA and MHC showed relatively hump shaped and DIS showed a reverse hump shaped pattern of change along altitudinal gradient. Woody species diversity decreased non-steadily from LoF to MoF. Transitional vegetations of Carpinus-Fagus and Fagus-Quercus represented higher diversity of woody taxa compared to adjacent homogenous communities. Significant correlation was observed between altitude and all parameters: DEN with MBA, DIS and DIV; MBA with DIS; MHC with DIS along with DIV; and DIS with DIV at the study area scale. Surprisingly, correlation between studied parameters differed within each vegetation type. Altitude probably acts as a proxy for human and environmental driving forces in this area. Stability of warm and wet condition, season length, soil depth along with forest accessibility probably influences the altitudinal pattern of the studied parameters. Disturbance affects forest structure and consequently diversity; especially in lowlands. The obtained results recommend using both forest biodiversity and mensuration data in management process of forest ecosystems.\\'Abstract: \\'Genetic diversity of Pongamia pinnata, a plant species emerging as biodiesel source, was assessed using three endonuclease (TE)-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. A total of 275 accessions from different Indian geographical regions were collected. High level of polymorphism (62.6%) was observed in 334 loci amplified using six primer combinations. The dissimilarity coefficient ranged from 0.17 to 0.80. Based on the neighbour joining method of clustering, accessions were grouped into six major clusters congruent with their respective geographical locations. The mean values of effective multiplex ratio, polymorphic information content, marker index and resolving power were 34.83, 0.286, 9.700 and 14.29 respectively. In addition, a core collection consisting of 20 accessions was identified. Population STRUCTURE analysis produced the highest log likelihood score when the number of populations (K) was set at 2, which was not consistent with clustering analysis based on genetic diversity. Two TE-AFLP markers, E_ac x P_a04 and E_ac x P_a39, were significantly associated with oil content (at The extent of genetic diversity detected and core germplasm of CPT identified in this study could be selected and used for tree breeding, germplasm conservation and suitable feed stock for biofuel.\\'Abstract: \\'The Andaman and Nicobar (A&N) group of islands is immensely rich in plant biodiversity. native tribes are hunter-gatherers, sustaining on wild or marine food and practically do not have any cultivation. Diversity in cultivated crops is presently maintained in home gardens by settlers from the mainland and other adjoining countries. The National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) through explorations either alone or in association with CARI or with other ICAR institutes has collected 1234 accessions in 48 exploration and collection missions. Variability was collected in rice, cowpea, black gram, green gram, okra, Chinese spinach, ash gourd, taro, cucumber, pumpkin, bottle gourd, ridge gourd, bitter gourd, chilli, greater yam and coconut. Indigenous landraces are absent. The conservation of the wild relatives of crops is well taken care of by a large number of protected forest reserves.\\'ISSR Markers\\'Abstract: \\'The genetic diversity in the wild and semi-domestic populations of Daba ecorace of Antheraea mylitta was studied to ascertain the distribution of variability within and among populations of semi-domestic bivoltine (DB), trivoltine (DT) and nature grown wild populations (DN) with inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. A total of 138 markers were produced among 56 individuals of the three populations, of which 98% were polymorphic. For the individual populations, the percentage polymorphism was 58.69, 52.9 and 77.54 for DB, DT and DN, respectively. Average number of observed and effective alleles was also high in the wild populations in comparison to the bivoltine and trivoltine semi-domestic populations. Genetic diversity (Ht) in DB, DT and DN was and respectively and within-population genetic diversity (Hs) ranged from 0.166 to 0.259 with a mean of 0.189. Mean gene differentiation (GST) was found to be 0.25. diversity index was 0.278, 0.237 and 0.361 for DB, DT and DN and overall it was 0.391. Gene flow (Nm) among the populations was 1.509. The dendrogram produced by UPGMA with genetic distance matrices resulted in the formation of three major clusters separating the three populations. Considerable intra- and inter-population variability is found in all three populations. The population structure analysis further suggests that the semi-domestic populations of Daba ecorace are at the threshold of differentiating themselves. The high genetic variability present within wild Daba population of A. mylitta is of much importance for conservation as well as utilization in systematic breeding program.\\'Abstract: \\' Human disturbance of habitat has important consequences for the demography, the morbidity, the behavior, and ultimately the survival of non-human primates. This paper is an effort to define, qualitatively, the potential influence of humans on monkey habitats and behavior in South Asia. Four variables are proposed and scored on a fourpoint scale. These variables can be used in comparisons within and between species. The four variables are description of the home range, level of harassment of the animals, habituation of the animals to humans, and the presence of predators. These measures are intentionally simple and conventional so that information may be retrieved from earlier field studies, and sites scored retrospectively. Methods for some continuous numerical measures of human influence are proposed for future studies.\\'Abstract: \\'The escalating loss of biological diversity throughout the world has become a major concern for the conservation biologists. Like other threatened plant species, the natural populations of the orchids are also severely threatened. Dendrobium thyrsiflorum is one such representative of the family Orchidaceae whose natural populations are getting destroyed at an alarming rate and deserves special conservation attention. Both direct shoot organogenesis (DSO) and indirect shoot organogensesis (ISO) pathways were experimented and the highest regeneration frequency for DSO and ISO pathways were found to be 86.2 and respectively. The regenerated shoots were best rooted in half-strength MS medium supplemented with indole butyric acid (IBA) and phloroglucinol. The genetic stability of the acclimatized plants derived from ISO and DSO pathways was assessed using Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR) and Start Codon Targeted (SCoT) molecular markers. SCoT proved to be a superior marker over ISSR in detecting clonal variability. The phytochemical analysis of the micropropagated plants also revealed a comprehensively higher yield of various secondary metabolites with significantly higher antioxidant potentials in both ISO- and DSO-derived plants over the mother plant. However, the ISO-derived plants were more phytochemically enriched compared to the DSO-plants. The rapid multiplication rate, higher genetic stability and secondary metabolite production ensures the utility of this micropropagation method for D. thyrsiflorum in the ex situ conservation and commercial exploitation of other important orchid species.\\'Pythium aphanidermatum \\'Abstract: \\' Zingiber zerumbet (L) Smith, a wild clonal species related to the cultivated ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe), is a potential resistance donor for soft rot disease in ginger caused by Pythium aphanidermatum (Edson) Fitzp. In this study we evaluated the genetic diversity and P. aphanidermatum resistance of 74 Z. zerumbet accessions belonging to 15 populations from eight districts in Kerala state, India. The disease index (DI) of the accessions varied from 0% to 72.24% and the accessions could be separated into six frequency classes according to their DI values. More than 65% of the accessions had a Eight accessions were found to be immune to the infection. The relative frequency of resistant accessions was higher in the central and northern regions of Kerala. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis of Z. zerumbet accessions using five primer combinations yielded 215 bands in total, of which 175 (81.4%) were polymorphic. genetic diversity (h) of 0.2738 and Shannon information index (I) of 0.4012 revealed a high genetic diversity in Z. zerumbet unexpected for a clonal species. In the UPGMA dendrogram, accessions were clustered mostly according to their geographical origin and no clear correspondence was observed between the clustering pattern of accessions and their responses to Pythium aphanidermatum. The study revealed high genetic diversity and variability for pathogen resistance among Z. zerumbet accessions and confirmed the value of Z. zerumbet as a potential donor for soft rot resistance for the genetic improvement of ginger.\\'Abstract: \\'Indian fisheries is increasingly contributing to the nutritional security of the country, with the present production of fish and shellfish from capture fisheries and aquaculture being over 7.8 The country also has an important role in global fisheries as the second largest producer of fish in the world and higher enhancement levels as compared to world fish production levels. Further, with an annual yield of over 4.8 from the inland fisheries sector, India is next only to China in the area. Increase in production of finfish and shellfish from 0.75 in to 7.8 during demonstrating a ten fold increase in the last five decades, is a testimony to the contributions of the sector. The share of inland fisheries sector, which was 29% in has gone up to over 55% at present.\\'Abstract: \\'Analysis of the mean wind, equivalent potential temperature and virtual potential temperature profiles observed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Electra aircraft and obtained from dropwindsondes and ship-launched radiosondes were made in conjunction with synoptic observations to study the structure of the monsoon boundary layer over the Arabian Sea during MONEX 79. Comparison of mean profiles indicates the monsoon boundary layer to be much different from the trade wind boundary layer. Results confirm the existence of a boundary-layer jet known as East African or Somali Jet. Regions of multiple cloud layers at roughly the height of the capping inversion layer were associated with the jet. Regions in which a more well-mixed layer was observed showed a jet structure depressed in height. A free-jet surface-layer model appears to describe the mean wind structure of this jet observed during the present study and by others. An approximate balance of forces was found in the monsoon boundary layer between friction, advective acceleration, Coriolis and pressure gradient forces. Friction and advective acceleration terms were significant in the lower levels of the boundary layer. Forces in a typical trade wind boundary layer were found to be approximately one order of magnitude smaller than those observed in the monsoon boundary layer.\\'Abstract: \\'A population of the S. Indian cyprinid fishBarbus melanampyx was sampled monthly through 24 months. Seasonal cycles of the gonado-somatic index (GSI), ovarian stages, male breeding tubercles, spawning behaviour and population structure were assessed. These fish breed strictly seasonally during the main dry period: December/January through April. Comparison with other Barbus species of the same general region led to the conclusion that the patterns of reproductive investment ofB. melanampyx are similar to those of perennial species, and different from those of wet-season spawners. The reasons for this rather unexpected result were found in the more constant conditions prevailing during a dry season as compared to the monsoon. It was argued thatB. melanampyx and the species spawning perennially are in effect spawners, rather than partial spawners.\\'Abstract: \\'Although Si is recognized as a beneficial element for crops, the determination of plant-available silicon (PAS) in soils has become challenging. A correlation between pH and PAS indicators has been reported in the literature due to the higher degree of weathering of acidic soil. We tested this hypothesis in the cultivated rice fields of Karnataka State, India, which exhibit gradients of pH and climate.\\'Abstract: \\'Comparative studies of sympatric species are essential in understanding those behavioral and ecological adaptations as well as the mechanisms that can reduce resource competition enough to allow coexistence. We collected data on diet, activity budget and habitat use from two sympatric macaque species, the Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis) and the rhesus macaque (M. mulatta), in a limestone seasonal rainforest of Nonggang Nature Reserve, southwestern Guangxi, China. Our results show that the two sympatric macaques differ in diet, activity budget, and habitat use: (1) out of the 131 plant species that were used by both macaque species as food over the year, only 15 plant species were shared. Rhesus macaques used more plant species as major foods, and had higher dietary diversity and evenness indexes than Assamese macaques. (2) Assamese macaques fed predominantly on leaves, whereas rhesus macaques fed more selectively on fruits. The rhesus diet varied according to season, and was significantly correlated to season fluctuation in fruit availability. (3) Assamese macaques devoted more time to resting, and less time to feeding than rhesus macaques (4) Assamese macaques were present mostly on the cliff, and tended to stay on the ground, whereas rhesus macaques were present mostly on the hillside, and showed preference to lower and middle canopy. The observed differences in diet and habitat use between the two macaque species represent behavioral patterns enabling their coexistence.\\'Abstract: \\'Estimating animal distributions and abundances over large regions is of primary interest in ecology and conservation. Specifically, integrating data from reliable but expensive surveys conducted at smaller scales with cost-effective but less reliable data generated from surveys at wider scales remains a central challenge in statistical ecology. In this study, we use a Bayesian smoothing technique based on a conditionally autoregressive (CAR) prior distribution and Bayesian regression to address this problem. We illustrate the utility of our proposed methodology by integrating (i) abundance estimates of tigers in wildlife reserves from intensive photographic methods, and (ii) estimates of tiger habitat occupancy from indirect sign surveys, conducted over a wider region. We also investigate whether the random effects which represent the spatial association due to the CAR structure have any confounding effect on the fixed effects of the regression coefficients.\\'Abstract: \\'Consumption of greens is a major source of vitamins and micro-nutrients for people using only vegetarian diets rich in carbohydrates. In remote rural settlements where vegetable cultivation is not practiced and market supplies are not organized, local inhabitants depend on indigenous vegetables, both cultivated in kitchen gardens and wild, for enriching the diversity of food. Knowledge of such foods is part of traditional knowledge which is largely transmitted through participation of individuals of households. A total of 123 households in six villages of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve buffer zone was surveyed using a schedule to assess the knowledge, availability and consumption pattern of wild leafy vegetables. Quantity estimations were done using regular visits with informants from 30 sample households of the six study villages during the collections. Monetization was used to see the value of wild leafy vegetables harvested during a year. The diversity of wild leafy vegetables being use by the local inhabitants is 21 species belonging to 14 genera and 11 families. This is far less than that being reported to be used by the communities from Western Ghats in India and some parts of Africa. Irrespective of social or economic status all households in the study villages had the knowledge and used wild leafy vegetables. The number of households reported to consume these wild leafy vegetables is greater than the number of households reporting to harvest them for all species except for Diplazium esculentum and Phytolacca acinosa. The availability and use period varied for the species are listed by the users. The study indicated that the knowledge is eroding due to changing social values and non participation of younger generation in collection and processing of such wild leafy vegetables.\\'Abstract: \\'The Balasore coastal groundwater basin in Orissa, India is under a serious threat of overdraft and seawater intrusion. The overexploitation resulted in abandoning many shallow tubewells in the basin. The main intent of this study is the development of a 2-D groundwater flow and transport model of the basin using the Visual MODFLOW package for analyzing the aquifer response to various pumping strategies. The simulation model was calibrated and validated satisfactorily. Using the validated model, the groundwater response to five pumping scenarios under existing cropping conditions was simulated. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that the Balasore aquifer system is more susceptible to the river seepage, recharge from rainfall and interflow than the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities and specific storage. Finally, based on the modeling results, salient management strategies are suggested for the long-term sustainability of vital groundwater resources of the Balasore groundwater basin. The most promising management strategy for the Balasore basin could be: a reduction in the pumpage from the second aquifer by 50% in the downstream region and an increase in the pumpage to 150% from the first and second aquifer at potential locations.\\'Abstract: \\'The size class distribution in tree populations will continue to be used for analysing the regeneration of tree species and successional patterns in forest communities at extensive levels. However, information regarding the approximate estimates of lifetime expectancy (residence time) for each of the size classes, viz seedlings, saplings and trees, and the estimates of rate of net gain for them (population divided by residence time) can considerably enhance our understanding of the regeneration trends of species. It is shown that several population structures, based on size class distribution may indicate declining population trend, although the population, as indicated by rate of net gain parameter, in fact may foretell future expansion or stability. It appears that high species richness and high percentages of species with poor regeneration are interrelated with each other.\\'Abstract: \\'This is an account of genetic, phytochemical, historical and cultural studies of sesame, Sesamum orientale L. and its wild relatives.

Though substantial energy savings can be achieved in the housing sector through implementation of various carbon mitigation options, it was stated that the incremental cost of implementing energy efficient measures is estimated to vary between 3 and 5% for residential houses. The challenge before the engineers, architects and other professionals associated with building construction sector is to find out appropriate technologies that will ensure reduction of GHG emission without increasing cost of construction. As majority of construction in government sector will come from construction of small residential house belonging to Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) as part of commitment to provide housing for all by 2020, assessment of GHG reduction potential of various cost-effective construction technologies is very essential to provide guidance to the stakeholders. This paper has surveyed various prevalent construction technologies in different parts of the country, analyzed the cost and embodied GHG emission for construction of the building envelope by collecting data through extensive search of literature and information obtained from construction sites. It has been found that there is ample scope of adoption of location-specific, cost-effective and eco-friendly construction technologies for construction of houses for EWS which are capable of reduction of GHG emission without any increase in cost of construction. The technologies can meet the commitment of the country at international level on reduction of GHG emission without any extra burden to state exchequer.\\'Abstract: \\'The present paper deals with the distribution of sediment and sediment-bound nutrients in two important coastal lagoons of southern Kerala such as the Ashtamudi Estuarine Lagoon in the Kollam district and the Kadinamkulam Lagoon in the Thiruvananthapuram district. Among the two lagoons, the former is coast perpendicular, and the latter is coast parallel. An analysis of the textural characteristics reveals that, in both lagoons, the estuarine mouth and areas close to it are dominated by sand and sand-rich sediment species, indicating a high-energy depositional regime prevailing the region. On the other hand, the silt and clay dominant arms are almost sheltered and enjoy a low-energy depositional environment. The nutrient and organic carbon contents in the sheltered areas are significantly higher than the most dynamic high-energy estuarine mouth regions. This peculiar behaviour of these coastal water bodies has to be given adequate importance while laying down strategies for the conservation and management of these fragile aquatic systems in the south-western coast of India in particular and tropical coasts of the world in general.\\'Abstract: \\'Avifaunal study was carried out in Panipat refinery area before and after commissioning. A total of 63 birds were observed during the study, of which 39 and 49 birds were present during 1992 and 2001 respectively. Of these, 25 birds were common during both the study period. Blue rock pigeon was most dominant during 1992 whereas house sparrow was dominant during 2001. Species diversity index was found to be 5.26 and 6.64 in respective years. and Sorenson similarity indices were 0.40 and 0.57 respectively. Majority of birds were insectivorous in habits followed by granivorous birds in 1992 and piscivorous birds in 2001. The study reveals that less diversity was observed in 1992 when Panipat refinery was commissioned, but more birds especially aquatic ones were observed after the commissioning of the refinery. This has been attributed to increase in birds habitats due to developments of wetlands in and outside refinery, development of green belt around refinery and increase in green cover of area due to boosting of agroforestry and social forestry.\\'Abstract: \\'Water balance of a basin involves estimation of input precipitation, runoff, infiltration and evapotranspiration (ET). Although ET may have large variations over a big basin, it is commonly estimated using a few point measurements and this makes the estimation error prone. Satellite based remote sensing data provides few parameters for estimation of energy fluxes, at the land surface and atmosphere interaction in a distributed manner using the meteorological parameters. These parameters through surface energy balance equation have been used for the estimation of ET in this study. Various spatially distributed variables required for ET estimation; viz. NDVI, surface albedo, surface temperature etc. have been derived using remote sensing and ancillary data for Tapi basin located in western India. Beside this field data such as rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity, sunshine hours etc. have been used. For computation of runoff, Soil Conservation Services (SCS) approach has been considered. Tapi basin up to Ukai dam has been selected as the study area. Satellite data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite, which carries the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), have been used for preparation of various maps required for runoff and ET analysis. The results of runoff and ET have been compared with observed data for and the results have been found in good agreement with observed data.\\'Abstract: \\'Soil amylase, cellulase, invertase and phosphatase activities were determined following wildfire in a savanna type grassland in southern India.

The purpose of the present research study is to identify the changes in land use and land cover in the Wular catchment as well as its transformation into other classes and its impact on the overall water quality of the lake. For the present study Landsat (TM) image of 1992 and Landsat-8 (OLI) of 2015 have been used for assessing the changes in land use/land cover. Supervised classification technique was used to generate LULC maps of different categories pertaining to study area for years 1992 and 2015. Regarding water quality, water samples were collected from five different spots of the lake in four different seasons of the December 2014 to September 2015. The sites from which samples were collected are Vintage Park, Ashtungo, Watlab, Makhdomyari and Ningal as site 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively. Some parameters of water like temperature, transparency, depth, conductivity and pH were examined on the spot during the sample collection by their respective measuring instruments. The rest of the parameters were examined in hydrological laboratory within after collection following the standard methods of APHA (Standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater, 21st edn. American Public Health Association, Washington, DC, 2005). The relationship between the LULC classes and water quality parameters has been calculated with the help of SHDI which has shown both positive and as well as negative results.\\'Abstract: \\'Two of the key factors that drive agricultural growth and food production in India are access to arable land and utilizable water resources. These are examined with particular reference to their regional variation in order to make an assessment of the magnitude of the food security challenge they pose for the country. Recent official estimates of groundwater exploitation in India are compared with actual negative physical, social and economic consequences of over-exploitation, as are evident in different regions, and their implications for national food security discussed. The analyses show that the real food security and water management challenge lies in the mismatch between water availability and agricultural water demand: high demands occur in water scarce but agriculturally prosperous regions and low demands in naturally water-abundant but agriculturally backward regions. Serious groundwater depletion problems, which occur in the naturally water-scarce but surplus food-producing regions, magnify the challenge. The small area of arable land per capita is a major reason for low agricultural water demand in regions that have abundant water. Sustainability of well irrigation in the naturally water-scarce regions, which is the backbone of food security, could be achieved through judicious investment in surface water projects which encourage direct irrigation and replenishment of over-exploited aquifers. Other strategies include: pro rata pricing of electricity in the farm sector; volumetric pricing of water from public irrigation systems; improving the efficiency of utilization of green water or the rainwater held in the soil profile; preventing depletion of the residual soil moisture in the field after crop harvest by reducing the fallow period; and reducing the use of water through a shift to low water consuming crops\\'Abstract: \\'Palaeoclimate and Palaeoecological study was carried out in m sediment core deposited since 4 ka in an estuarine environment along Uppanar River mouth, Cauvery Delta. Palynological and thecamoebian evidences indicate (1) a basal fluvial lacustrine depositional environment ka) characterized by sandy sediment, with low salinity and dominance of non-pollen forms like foraminiferal linings and thecamoebians with a low percentage of pollen and spores and (2) an estuarine environment (since 3 ka) characterized by clayey sediment with high salinity and a good percentage of mangrove and terrestrial pollen along with non-pollen forms. A shift in the depositional environment since ka indicates monsoonal and geomorphological changes in the coastal wetland. During this period dominance of Avicennia and Cheno/Ams indicate low freshwater runoff from land suggesting a weakened monsoon condition enhanced by anthropogenic activity.\\'Abstract: \\'We investigated decomposition and nutrient release patterns of leaf and sheath litter of two important highland bamboo species (viz. Phyllostachys bambusoides Sieb. (Zucc.) and Arundinaria racemosa Munro) by using a litter bag technique. Our objective was to improve understanding of the addition of organic matter and nutrients to soil from the litter of two abundant highland bamboo species, species that support the local population of the region in many ways. N concentration and N/P ratio were significantly higher (p<0.01) in leaf litter of P. bambusoides. Significantly, larger values of lignin concentration, C/N ratio, and lignin/N ratio were found in the sheath litter of A racemosa. Weight loss of both leaf and sheath litter was strongly positively correlated with N and N/P ratio, and significantly negatively correlated (p<0.01) with C/N ratio. Lignin/N had a negative correlation with decay rate. In both species, only lignin concentration of the litter showed strong positive correlation with N release. Litter decomposition and N release patterns were similar for the two bamboo species, whereas, P release rate from leaf litter was higher in P. bambusoides and differed significantly between sheath and leaf litter for both species. The complex pattern of nutrient release through mineralization and immobilization during litter decomposition ensures nutrient availability in both managed and natural bamboo stands subjected to anthropogenic disturbances.\\'Abstract: \\'The paper presents the nature of annual cycles of tropospheric ozone, cloud occurrences, NO2, rainfall, SO2, SPM, CO, non-methane hydrocarbon and surface solar radiation for the period October 2004 to June 2009 over Alipore India. Annual cycle of low-level cloud occurrences depicts that the low-level cloud over Alipore had been noticed to occur for many days and nights, particularly from June to September. The low-level cloud occurrences were found in winter months and post-monsoon period. The effect of cloud occurrences on tropospheric ozone concentration has been critically analysed and explained. It has been observed that the concentration of ozone is oscillatory with cloud occurrences and has a slight linear decreasing trend with the increase of cloud occurrences and vice versa. The concentration of tropospheric ozone attained higher value at moderate cloud occurrences and comparatively lower value at both of the lower and higher cloud occurrences. The related possible chemical and physical explanation for role of cloud occurrences on tropospheric ozone has been offered.\\'Abstract: \\'Three frog species (Limnodynastes tasmaniensis, Limnodynastes fletcheri and Litoria  raniformis) were surveyed in rice bays of the Coleambally Irrigation Area (CIA), NSW, Australia, during the rice-growing seasons of 2005/2006 and 2006/2007. A total external morphological abnormality index of 7.0% was observed in frogs of the CIA The types and frequencies of abnormalities were typical of reports from agricultural areas with ectrodactyly being the most common aberration. A relatively low abnormality index of 1.2% was observed in L. raniformis compared to indices of 7.1% and 8.2% observed in L. fletcheri and L. tasmaniensis respectively. No conclusive evidence was found of unnaturally high rates of intersex, gonadal maldevelopment or unbalanced sex ratios in any species. Rice bay  surface waters differed significantly in mean pesticide concentrations of atrazine and metolachlor on farms growing rice and corn compared to farms with rice as the sole crop. However, the similar abnormality indices observed in recent metamorphs emerging from these two farm types provided no evidence to suggest a link between larval exposure to the measured pesticides and developmental malformations.\\'Abstract: \\'A study was conducted to investigate the response of Jatropha curcas L., an important bio-diesel plant species, to arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) inoculations. AM species, isolated from its rhizosphere could colonize its roots/rhizospheres, indicating that J. curcas does not retard the activities of AM fungi. However, the seedlings did not respond positively to the inoculations and mycorrhizal dependency (MD) for some inoculants was in the negative range. This could be due to the large amount of nutrients stored in cotyledons of big sized J. curcas seeds. Further results showed that the removal of cotyledons (metabolic reserves) immediately after seed germination did not increase MD of J. curcas. Workers from different countries have reported variable results on this aspect and it is generally admitted that different populations, varieties, cultivars or strains of any specific cultivated crop may react differently to different situations such as inoculation with AM fungi. Therefore, it will be worthwhile to test the different populations of J. curcas from various locations under a given set of conditions.\\'Abstract: \\'This paper tries to understand the soil erosion characteristics in a tropical plateau fringe region by the use of Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Soil loss estimation is an important phenomenon to understand the land degradation. An integrated method needs to be adopted in tropical plateau fringe region to estimate the soil loss. RUSLE has been adopted for the present study. The river in the basin under consideration sees its origin from a plateau top region and flows through the plateau fringe region of eastern Chotanagpur plateau, India. The present study area reflects undulated plateau fringe landform with gently sloping dissected plateau topography. The different factors like, rainfall erosivity factor (R), soil erodibility factor (K), topographic factor (LS), crop and management factor (C), and support and practice factor (P) have been enumerated using field and remote sensing data. Each factors result has also been verified with previous literature. All factors have been multiplied in GIS environment to estimate soil loss. High-magnitude soil loss region covers 4.88% of the total area and extends up to the upper reaches of the watershed. Topographic and soil factors best represent this loss. Low-magnitude soil loss region in the lower reaches of the watershed is a result of successful land management activity. Soil erosion is dominated process of land degradation in the upper reaches of the watershed and estimation of soil loss is an important input for land-use land-cover management. The study also inferred that RUSLE soil erosion model could be effectively used in tropical plateau fringe environment.\\'Abstract: \\'The southwestern coast of India is drained by many small rivers with lengths less than and catchment areas less than These rivers are perennial and are also the major drinking water sources in the region. But, the fast pace of urbanization, industrialization, fertilizer intensive agricultural activities and rise in pilgrim tourism in the past four to five decades have imposed marked changes in water quality and solute fluxes of many of these rivers. The problems have aggravated further due to leaching of ionic constituents from the organic-rich (peaty) impervious sub-surface layers that are exposed due to channel incision resulting from indiscriminate instream mining for construction-grade sand and gravel. In this context, an attempt has been made here to evaluate the water quality and the net nutrient flux of one of the important rivers in the southwestern coast of India, the Manimala river which has a length of about and catchment area of The river exhibits seasonal variation in most of the water quality parameters (pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, HCO3, NO2-N, NO3-N, chloride, SO4, and SiO2). Except for NO3-N and SiO2, all the other parameters are generally enriched in non-monsoon samples than that of monsoon The flux estimation reveals that the Manimala river transports an amount of of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, and of SO4, and K into the receiving coastal waters. These together constitute about 23% of the total dissolved fluxes transported by the Manimala river. Based on the study, a set of mitigation measures are also suggested to improve the overall water quality of small catchment rivers of the densely populated tropics in general and the south western coast in particular.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Eight accessions of swordbean (Canavalia gladiata (Jacq.) DC.) were collected from eight agroclimatic regions of Tamil Nadu, India. A portion of the collected seeds of accessions will be deposited in NBPGR, New Delhi. The most pronounced differences in agrobotanical characters were observed in seed germination percentage, plant height, number of branches per plant, number of leaves (180th day) per plant, leaf area (150th day), early flowering, fertility index and 100-seed-weight. Differences in the contents of crude protein and crude lipid in the seeds of different accessions also appeared to be significant. Performance of Lowerkodiyar and Mundanthurai accessions under test conditions was superior and suggested that breeders might exploit the genome of these accessions in current pulse crop improvement programmes.\\'Abstract: \\'Teak (Tectona grandis L. f.; family Verbanaceae) is an important plantation tree species in the tropics and in India one of the first species to be prioritized for improvement. Improvement efforts for the last 50 years have essentially concentrated on augmenting quality seed production by establishing seed production areas (SPA) and clonal seed orchards (CSO). Presently, these two form the main sources of quality planting material for teak throughout the country. However, there is no information on the genetic quality of such sources nor information on the progeny used in plantation programmes. Reports of studies based on coniferous and tropical species provide conflicting results on the impact of domestication on the genetic diversity of populations (Chaisurisri and El Kassaby, 1994; Rajora, 1999; Moran 2000; Godt 2001; Icgen 2006). Also the impact of domestication on the genetic diversity of progeny populations is poorly understood (Stoehr and...\\'Abstract: \\'An efficient and rapid micropropagation system was developed for a food and medicinally important endangered shrub, Decalepis hamiltonii through shoot multiplication. The influence of isopentenyladenine (2iP), 6-benzyladenine, kinetin, thidiazuron, and zeatin alone and in combination with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) on in vitro multiple shoot production was studied. The maximum number of multiple shoots was induced from shoot tips cultured on agar-based Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 4.9 2iP. But, both zeatin (9.1 and kinetin (4.7 in combination with IAA (0.6 were able to produce a maximum of and multiple shoots, respectively. Further elongation of shoots and adventitious shoot formation was obtained on medium containing 2.5 2iP and 0.3 gibberellic acid. Elongated shoots were separated and rooted on MS medium supplemented with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and various phenolic compounds within wk. Phloroglucinol and salicylic acid interaction with IBA stimulated in vitro rooting of shoots. Successful field transfer was achieved in rooted plantlets.\\'Abstract: \\'Shoot tip and single node explants from young shoots of 1-year old flowering plants of Rauwolfia micrantha Hook. f. were cultured on Murashige & Skoog (MS) medium variously supplemented with 6-benzyladenine (BA) and acid (NAA). A combination of 13.2 BA and 2.68 NAA induced high frequency (77%) formation of up to 3 shoots from each node in 8 weeks. The regeneration of shoot tips from the field-grown plants and in vitro shoots placed horizontally differed. Repeated subculturing of the shoot tips and single nodes at 6-week intervals for over a year in combination of 4.4 BA and 0.27 NAA enabled mass multiplication of shoots without any evidence of decline. Rooting of the excised shoots on medium containing 2.6 NAA was preceded by callus formation. The rooted plants were removed off the callus, hardened off and 80% established in pots. Micropropagated plants displayed uniform morphological, growth, flowering, fruiting and seed germination characteristics.\\'Abstract: \\'Wildlife poisoning is an important conservation threat for endangered species in India. There are no publications in the scientific literature that identify the specific poisons or chemicals involved in wildlife poisoning cases from the state of Kerala. In this report, all cases of wildlife mortality recorded between 2011 and 2013 at the office of the Assistant Forest Veterinary Officer, Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala were reviewed and cases where poisoning was considered as a differential diagnosis were identified. Specific poisons or chemicals were identified in three cases, while in a fourth, poisoning was determined to have occurred based on physical traces of the poison in gut contents. The poisons identified include carbofuran (a carbamate pesticide) in a bonnet macaque (Macaca radiata), warfarin (a rodenticide) in a mortality event involving four wild boars (Sus scrofa), endosulfan (an organochlorine pesticide) toxicity in a gaur (Bos gaurus) and imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid pesticide) toxicity in a wild adult Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). This communication thus reports for the first time on the specific chemical compounds identified in wildlife poisoning cases from Kerala state and argues for greater regulation of the sale and use of such toxic compounds in India.\\'Bengal\\'Abstract: \\'Chintamani Abhayaranya in South 24-Parganas, West Bengal has an exposure to anthropogenic stress for its location. Soil mites here, constituted more than 73% of the population of soil microarthropods. Oribatid mites were found to be the most numerically abundant group among the soil mites, followed by order Mesostigmata. Population maxima and minima of the mite community were recorded during September and May respectively. Soil moisture and organic carbon content of the soil showed strong positive correlation with the abundance of mite population. One-way ANOVA revealed significant difference between the seasonal abundances of mite population. Group diversity of mite population was highest during July and lowest during January. No significant correlation, as per rank correlation analysis was noticed between the group diversity and edaphic factors. Regression analysis showed that only a small fraction variabilty of group diversity could be explained separately by four edaphic factors considered.\\'Abstract: \\'Two aristolochiaceous plants in the genusThottea were shown to contain aristolochic acids. Larvae of two Malaysian troidine swallowtail butterflies,Troides (Troides) amphrysus andPachliopta (Losaria) neptunus, that fed onThottea leaves were found to sequester corresponding aristolochic acid analogs in the osmeterial glands.\\'Abstract: \\'We compared morphological and genetic attributes of progeny obtained from three seed production areas (SPAs) and three corresponding unimproved stands (UIS) of teak (Tectona grandis L.f) at three broad teak growing regions in the state of Karnataka, India. In general, seed morphological parameters such as seed weight, seed size and seed emptiness were significantly superior in SPAs compared to UISs. Seed germination percentage was also higher in seeds from SPAs. Seedling performance measured at two monthly intervals for six months was observed to be superior in SPAs at two of the three regions compared. Although the genetic diversity of progeny of SPAs was lower than UIS at all regions, the values were moderately high. Germination percent was positively correlated with fruit weight and kernel weight per seed, while diversity indices were negatively correlated with fruit weight, fruit diameter and kernel weight per seed. SPAs proved important as a source of moderately improved planting material with no severe threat to the genetic diversity of future plantations.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'The present paper documents the uses of plants in traditional herbal medicine for human and veterinary ailments, and those used for dietary supplements, religious purpose, local beverage, and plants used to poison fish and wild animals.

This research provides information about the fisheries diversity status by Estuarine Set Bag Net (ESBN) sampling relation to physicochemical variables in both spatio-temporal scales. About of the lower estuary was divided into six zones for sample collection by considering the accessibility and availability of the ESBN operation, fish landing centers and location of the fishing villages. In total 48 samples have been analyzed which were taken throughout March to October 2006. To quantify the species diversity, all fisheries data were analyzed by using EstimateS and EcoSim software which accounts the different diversity indices viz., species richness, diversity Index, Dominance and Evenness index. The research results demonstrate that the Naaf River estuary is a habitat of 161 (species richness, Choa different species which belong to 98 fin fishes, 23 shrimps and prawns, 13 crabs, 11 molluscs, 3 echinoderms, 4 other crustaceans; while 9 remain unidentified. Results on the aquatic environment, mainly salinity and turbidity were found to have a major influence on their occurrence and distribution. All the findings indicated that the Naaf River estuary is a highly productive system and provides a favourable environment for large variety of estuarine species assemblages.\\'Abstract: \\'This paper investigates how changes in neighborhood schools, health posts, bus services, mills, dairies, agricultural cooperatives, and other perceptions of environmental degradation. We use three types of data from a rural area in Nepal: (1) data on changing neighborhood facilities from 171 neighborhoods, collected using ethnographic, survey, and archival methods; (2) survey data on household characteristics and environmental perceptions from 1,651 households; and (3) individual-level survey data. We find that new neighborhood facilities are associated with perceptions of environmental degradation. This is important because perceptions may indicate objective environmental degradation, encourage participation in programs to improve the environmental, and influence environmental behavior.\\'Abstract: \\'Fine root turnover (<2 mm) was determined from repeated measurements of root distribution up to 120 cm soil depth by core sampling in four month intervals. Sole cropped Sorghum bicolor and Acacia saligna were compared with the agroforestry combination in an alley cropping system in semiarid Northern Kenya. Three methods for the calculation of root production were used: the max-min, balancing-transfer and compartment-flow method. The highest root biomass was found in the topsoil for all cropping systems, though trees had a deeper root system. Trees and crops had a similar amount of below-ground biomass during the vegetation period (0.3 and 0.4 Mg DM ha-1 120 cm-1), but in the agroforestry combination root biomass was more than the sum of the sole cropped systems (1.1 Mg DM ha-1 120 cm-1). The tree system showed a very static root development with little fluctuation between seasons, whereas root biomasses were very dynamic in the crop and tree + crop systems. Root production was highest in the tree + crop combination with 2.1 Mg DM ha-1 a-1, with about 50% less in sole cropped trees and crops. Root N input to soil decreased in the order tree + crop>tree>crop system with 13.5, 11.0 and 3.2 kg N ha-1 a-1, and cannot be estimated from total below-ground biomass or carbon turnover, as N is accumulated in senescing roots. Such low N input to soil stresses the need for investigating other processes of nutrient input from roots to soil. Areas of highest N input were identified in the topsoil under the tree row in the tree system. Resource utilisation and C and N input to soil were highest with a combination of annual and perennial crops.\\'Abstract: \\'Forest plays a vital role in regulating climate through carbon sequestration in its biomass. Biomass reflects the health and environmental conditions of a forest ecosystem. In context to the climate change mitigation mechanisms like REDD (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), an extensive forest monitoring campaign is especially important. Remote sensing of forest structure and biomass with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) bears significant potential for mapping and understanding forest ecological processes. Limitations of the conventional forest inventory procedures, like the extensive cost, labor and time, can be overcome through integrated geospatial techniques. Optical sensor or SAR data are suitable for extracting information about simple and homogeneous forest stand sites. However, optical sensors face serious limitations, specifically in tropical regions, like the cloud cover that SAR can overcome along with targeting saturation and penetration aspects. Simultaneous use of spectral information and image texture parameters improves the biomass assessment over undulating terrain and in radical conditions. Also, synergic use of multi-sensor optical and SAR has better potential than single sensor. Interferometric (InSAR) and polarimetric (PolSAR) SAR or a combination of the both (PolInSAR) serves as effective alternatives. These techniques could serve as valuable methods for biomass assessment of heterogeneous complex biophysical environments. However, SAR data have its own limitations and complexities. Identifying, understanding and solving major uncertainties in different stages of the biomass estimation procedure are critical. In this regard, the current study provides a review of radar remote sensing-based studies in forest biomass estimation.\\'Abstract: \\'Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is known for its nutritional, medicinal, and ornamental importance. It is conventionally propagated by hardwood and softwood cuttings, but about is needed before the rooted cuttings can be transplanted to the field. Propagation by seed is undesirable as populations are heterozygous and seed propagation leads to wide variations in tree and fruit characteristics. Several studies have been conducted on in vitro culture of pomegranate, and protocols have been developed for plant regeneration through organogenesis and embryogenesis from various types of explants. Tissue culture has enabled mass propagation of superior genotypes of both wild and cultivated varieties. However, successful application of tissue culture systems for genetic engineering of pomegranate is still limited. Molecular markers are essential for identification and discrimination of genotypes for genetic conservation, crop improvement, breeding programs, and commercialization of superior genotypes. These techniques may also be applicable to rapid identification and indexing of disease-free planting material. This review focuses on the biotechnological approaches that are being used for pomegranate improvement.\\'Abstract: \\'Leh and surrounding region of the Ladakh mountain range in the trans-Himalaya experienced multiple cloudbursts and associated flash floods during August 2010. However, rainfall recorded at the nearest meteorological station at Leh did not corroborate with the flood severity. For better understanding of this event, hydrological analysis and atmospheric modeling are carried out in tandem. Two small catchments were studied along the stream continuum to assess the flood characteristics to identify the cloudburst impact zones. Peak flood discharges were estimated close to the head wall region and at the catchment outlet of the Leh town and the Sabu eastern tributary catchments. Storm runoff depth is estimated by developing a triangular hydrograph by using the known time base of the flood hydrograph. This triangular hydrographs have been transformed further into storm hydrographs to gain a better understanding of the storm duration by using the dimensionless hydrograph method at selected cross sections. Storm duration is estimated by using the relationship between time to peak and time of concentration of the catchment. The peak flood estimates ranged from m3/s for Leh town catchment m3/s for Sabu eastern tributary catchment to m3/sec for Sabu catchment To assess the atmospheric processes associated with this event, a triple nest simulation (27, 9 and is performed using Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) modeling system. The simulation does show the evolution of the event from August 4 to 6, 2010. Observation constraints, orographic responses, etc. make such analysis complex at such scale. Independent estimate by the atmospheric process model and the hydrological method shows the storm depth of and respectively, in catchment scale. Hydrological evaluation further refined the spatial and temporal extents of the cloudbursts in the respective catchments with an estimated storm depth of in and in occurring in an area of respectively. This study shows that the insight developed on the cloudburst phenomena by the atmospheric and the hydrological modeling is hugely constrained by the spatial and temporal scales of data used for the analysis. Apart from this, study also highlighted the regular occurrence of cloudburst events over this region in the recent past. Most of such events go unreported due to lack of monitoring mechanisms in the region and weaken our ability to understand these events in complete perspective.\\'Abstract: \\'Major advances have been made in our understanding of the biology and biotechnology of the bael tree (Aegle marmelos), which is used for marmalade and has other applications.\\'Abstract: \\'A Gram-negative, non-motile, catalase-positive and oxidase-positive, aerobic bacterium designated as NII-0918T was isolated from soil sample in Western ghat forest, India. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain NII-0918T belongs to the subclass being related to the genus Paracoccus, and sharing highest sequence similarity with Paracoccus chinensis NBRC 104937T (99.4%), Paracoccus marinus NBRC 100640T (97.3%), Paracoccus koreensis Ch05T (97.1%) and Paracoccus kondratievae GBT (97.0%). Other members of Paracoccus showed below 97.0% similarity. The hybridization values between these four strains and NII-0918T were 44.7, 28, 32 and 41%, respectively. The major fatty acids of strain NII-0918T were summed feature 7 (C18:1 12t) (83.0%) and C18:0 (12.5%). Ubiquinone Q-10 was detected as the major respiratory quinone. The G+C content of genomic DNA of NII-0918T was On the basis of physiological, morphological, chemotaxonomical and hybridization data, it is proposed that strain NII-0918T should be placed as a novel species, for which we propose Paracoccus niistensis sp. nov. The type strain is NII-0918T (CCTCC AA 22789T).\\'Abstract: \\'Safe structures are the backbone of human coping capacity towards healthy living that can contribute significantly in reducing risk during hazards. However, due to various natural and anthropogenic activities, about 12.6% of land areas (excluding snow-covered area) in India are prone to landslide posing threat to life and property. Moreover, many structures in the hilly terrain of India are non-engineered which results in high vulnerability of buildings. Therefore, assessment of physical vulnerability is a fundamental step in reducing landslide risk. The study aims to present a methodology to assess vulnerability of the buildings using indicator-based approach at site-specific scale. Several studies to assess vulnerability of buildings due to landslides have been carried out by researchers from European countries. But these methodologies cannot be implemented successfully in India because of different geological and climatic condition. The different components of the discussed methodology for physical vulnerability of buildings exposed to landslides such as landslide intensity (a function of landslide velocity and volume) and resistance of buildings (a function of structural and non-structural features) are worked out and suggested by different researchers. However, putting them together, to present as a framework (specifically in Indian scenario) is the novelty of the present work. Further, consideration of the concept of of buildings to in the process of site-specific vulnerability assessment is newly proposed. To address this issue, fifteen potential indicators contributing to vulnerability of buildings have been identified and a systematic form for documentation of data during field survey has also been prepared (keeping in view the construction bye-laws and techniques followed in India). The methodology discussed is further successfully implemented in ward number 10 of Gopeshwar Township (Chamoli District), Uttarakhand, India.\\'Abstract: \\'Improving quality of life (QoL) is one of the main goals of many public policies. A useful tool to measure QoL needs to get a good balance between indicators guided by theories (top-down approach) and indicators defined by local people (bottom-up approach). However, QoL measurement tools often neglect to include elements that define the standard of living at local level. In this paper, we analyse the correspondence between human development index, as an indicator adopted by governments to assess QoL, and the elements defined by local people as important in their QoL, called here local means. Using a free-listing technique, we collected information from 114 individuals from Kodagu, Kartanataka (India), to capture local means defining QoL. We then compared local means with the indicators used by Human development report (HDR) of Karnataka, the main measurement tool of QoL in Kodagu. The list of local means included access to basic facilities and many issues related to agriculture and natural resources management as elements locally defining QoL. We also found that HDR does not capture the means defined by people as indicators of QoL. Our findings suggest an important gap between current indicators considered by public policies and the means of QoL defined by people. Our study provides insights for a set of plausible local indicators useful to achieve a balance between top-down and bottom-up approaches for the local public policies.\\'Abstract: \\'Evaluation of litterfall production is important for understanding nutrient cycling, forest growth, successional pathways, and interactions with environmental variables in forest ecosystems. Litterfall was intensively studied during the period of in two subtropical monsoon vegetation gradients in the Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve, Guangdong Province, China. The two gradients include: (1) a successional gradient composed of pine forest (PF), mixed pine and broadleaved forest (MF) and monsoon evergreen broadleaved forest (BF), and (2) an altitudinal gradient composed of Baiyunci ravine rain forest (BRF), Qingyunci ravine rain forest (QRF), BF and mountainous evergreen broadleaved forest (MMF). Mean annual litterfall production was 356, 861 and for PF, MF and BF of the successional gradient, and 1016, 1061, 849 and for BRF, QRF, BF and MMF of the altitudinal gradient, respectively. As expected, mean annual litterfall of the pioneer forest PF was the lowest, but rapidly increased over the observation period while those in other forests were relatively stable, confirming that forest litterfall production is closely related to successional stages and growth patterns. Leaf proportions of total litterfall in PF, MF, BF, BRF, QRF and MMF were 76.4%, 68.4%, 56.8%, 55.7%, 57.6% and 69.2%, respectively, which were consistent with the results from studies in other evergreen broadleaved forests. Our analysis on litterfall monthly distributions indicated that litterfall production was much higher during the period of April to September compared to other months for all studied forest types. Although there were significant impacts of some climate variables (maximum and effective temperatures) on litterfall production in some of the studied forests, the mechanisms of how climate factors (temperature and rainfall) interactively affect litterfall await further study.\\'Mabb.\\'Abstract: \\'Comprehensive transcriptome analysis of leaf and root tissues of Nothapodytes nimmoniana unravels several putative pathway genes, transcription factors and CYPs related to camptothecin (CPT) biosynthesis.

This network, with some plots having been remeasured since 1870, proved to be a rich source of observations, and constituted the empirical basis for fundamental theories in production ecology. Realizing the strategic value of long-term field observations, scientists are using (a) designed experiments and (b) observational studies to study forest structure and dynamics. This contribution is an attempt to clarify fundamental differences, and to present examples, of these two approaches. We present recent developments regarding the installation of Designed Experiments and show that rigorous experimental design, usually found in planted forests and based on very specific manipulations, that are normally not found in the natural environment is required to address a particular hypothesis that cannot be tested by merely using available observations. We also present examples of new Forest Observational Networks established in China, India, Africa and America. These alternative research infrastructures are especially suitable for the study of natural forests that exhibit a high diversity of tree species with varying size and age structures. Our conclusion is that Forest Observational Studies are emerging as an important alternative to Designed Experiments because they provide a vast amount of information about complex natural forest communities rather quickly. However, long-term commitment is essential to ensure a steady flow of observations about forest dynamics. Manipulated experiments and observational studies can be complementary, but the optimum use of both installations requires careful planning and coordination.\\'Abstract: \\' Asparagus racemosus Willd. is an important medicinal plant of tropical and subtropical India. Its medicinal usage has been reported in the Indian and British Pharmacopoeias and in traditional systems of medicine such as Ayurveda, Unani, and Siddha. The multiple uses of this species have increased its commercial demand, resulting in over-exploitation. Because of destructive harvesting, the natural population of A. racemosus is rapidly disappearing, and it is recognized as (Warner et al., Some important medicinal plants of the Western Ghats, India: a profile. International Development Research Centre, Artstock, New Delhi, India, 15 pp, 2001). The development of an efficient micropropagation protocol will play a significant role in meeting the requirements for commercial cultivation, thereby conserving the species in its natural habitat. In the present study, in vitro shoot proliferation was obtained by culturing single node segments in Murashige and (MS) medium supplemented with 2-isopentyl adenine and 3% sucrose with a multiplication rate of 3.5. For proper root formation, the in vitro-formed shoot clusters were cultured on half strength (major salts reduced to half) MS medium with 1-naphthalene acetic acid, kinetin, adenine sulfate, malt extract, phloroglucinol, and 3% sucrose. On this medium, 85% rooting was observed within Following a simple hardening procedure involving sequential transfer of plants to a greenhouse, polyhouse, and shade net, the tissue-cultured plants were transferred to the field where the survival rate was 100%.\\'Abstract: \\'Genetic and genotypic variabilities of a rare relict aquatic plant Nelumbo komarovii Grossh. from six natural populations of Primorsky krai (Russia) were assessed using isozyme analysis. The highest genetic and genotypic diversities were observed in the and Okeanskaya populations, which can be explained by cross-pollination participation in the seed formation for maintenance of the population size and by sowing seeds from different habitats for the Okeanskaya population. Low polymorphism at the population level (P = 8.97, HO = 0.055, HE = 0.039) is determined by the history of existence of the species from the Tertiary Period as well as by the influence of gene drift. Clonal renewal plays a decisive role in the propagation of N. komarovii in most natural populations.\\'Abstract: \\'Soil erosion by water is ubiquitous, exhibits spatio-temporal variability, and is fundamental to determining sediment yield which is key to proper watershed management. In this study, we propose a relationship between the curve number and sediment yield index (SYI) using cubic splines. Using field data from four watersheds, the relation between observed and computed SYI is found to have a coefficient of determination (R2) value from 0.63 to 0.88 suggesting that such a relation can be used to determine SYI from the available CN value. It is found that cubic splines perform satisfactorily with Nash-Sutcliff efficiency ranging from 60.18 to 64.01%, absolute prediction error from 1.35 to 5.56%, integral square error from 1.21 to 5.82%, coefficient of correlation from 79.32 to 93.78%, and degree of agreement from 0.87 to 0.99%.\\'Abstract: \\'With the continuous increase in the population of developing countries and decline of natural resources, there is an urgent need to qualitatively and quantitatively augment crop productivity by using new tools and technologies for improvement of agriculturally important traits.

Recent developments in sequencing techniques have made available huge amount of genomic and transcriptomic data on model and cultivated crop plants including Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Triticum aestivum etc. The sequencing data along with other data generated through several omics platforms have significantly influenced the disciplines of crop sciences. Gene discovery and expression profiling-based technologies are offering enormous opportunities to the scientific community which can now apply marker-assisted selection technology to assess and enhance diversity in their collected germplasm, introgress essential traits from new sources and investigate genes that control key traits of crop plants. Utilization of omics science and technologies for crop productivity, protection and management has recently been receiving a lot of attention; the majority of the efforts have been put into signifying the possible applications of various omics technologies in crop plant sciences. This article highlights the background of challenges and opportunities for augmentation of crop productivity through interventions of omics technologies in India.\\'Abstract: \\' Ocimum kilimandscharicum Guerke (Lamiaceae), alien to the Indian flora, was discovered in the natural habitat from two locations of different agro-ecological zones of Odisha. After critical review of published literature on distribution, it was earlier known only from Uttarakhand. However, its natural occurrence in Odisha was found to be a new record for peninsular India. A detailed diagnostic description, photographs, ecology and potentiality of the species was provided for easy identification and further economic utilization.\\'Abstract: \\'Groundwater recharge is an important process for the management of both surface and subsurface water resources. The present study utilizes the application of analytical hierarchical process (AHP) on geospatial analysis for the exploration of potential zones for artificial groundwater recharge along Vaigai upper basin in the Theni district, Tamil Nadu, India. The morphology of earth surface features such as geology, geomorphology, soil types, land use and land cover, drainage, lineament, and aquifers influence the groundwater recharge in either direct or indirect way. These thematic layers are extracted from Landsat ETM+ image, topographical map, and other collateral data sources. In this study, the multilayers were weighed accordingly to the magnitude of groundwater recharge potential. The AHP technique is a pair-wise matrix analytical method was used to calculate the geometric mean and normalized weight of individual parameters. Further, the normalized weighted layers are mathematically overlaid for preparation of groundwater recharge potential zone map. The results revealed that of the total area are identified as high potential for groundwater recharge. The gentle slope areas in middle-east and central part have been moderately potential for groundwater recharge. Hilly terrains in south are considered as unsuitable zone for groundwater recharge processes.\\'Abstract: \\'North east India is considered as one of the major biodiversity hotspots worldwide and centre of origin of several plant species including Musa. Musa acuminata Colla is known to be one of the wild progenitors of cultivated bananas and plantains. Three single primer based DNA marker techniques viz., random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and directed amplification of minisatellites DNA (DAMD) were used for diversity diagnostics among 25 genotypes of wild M. acuminata collected from Meghalaya province of north east India. A total of 58 primers (26-RAPD, 21-ISSR, and11-DAMD) yielded 451 DNA fragments, of which 395 were found to be polymorphic in nature. The polymorphic information content (PIC) values were almost identical for each marker system. The resolving power of the marker system was found to be highest in RAPD (3.96) whereas ISSR resolved highest marker index (16.39) in the study. Selected amplicon data obtained through single primer amplification reactions were utilized for determination of diversity within and among the populations of M. acuminata. genetic differentiation (Gst) value (0.451) indicated higher proportion of the genetic variation within the populations which is supported by the AMOVA analysis The study provides insight into the efficacy of RAPD, ISSR and DAMD to analyse the genetic variation existing in the wild Musa germplasm, which can exploited for quality trait improvement and domestication of such important horticultural crops. The genetic diversity based population structure may shed light on the genetic basis of speciation and evolution of various species within the genus Musa.\\'Abstract: \\'Insect visitors documented on cashew flowers during the present investigation include 40 species belonging to 13 families of three insect orders. The Hymenopterans were the major floral visitors comprising of bees, ants and wasps followed by dipterans. Among the 40 species recorded as flower visitors, only 13 are considered as pollinators of cashew, in which eight belong to Apidae and five belong to Halictidae. Among the two bee families, Apidae was the most abundant contributing 75.6% of the bee abundance. Within Apidae, the highest species abundance was recorded for Braunsapis picitarsus (20%) followed by Apis cerana indica (16.7%). Halictidae bees contributed to 24.4% of bee abundance, among which Pseudapis oxybeloides was most abundant (17.6%). Peak bee activity was recorded between 11.00 and for most of the bees. During B. picitarsus was the most abundant followed by P. oxybeloides A. c. indica Ceratina sp. and A. florea Foraging rate was more for A. c. indica followed by B. picitarsus and A. florea. Lesser time was spent by A. c. indica for nectar and P. oxybeloides for pollen (i.e. while longer time of and was spent by A. florea, B. picitarsus and Tetragonula sp., respectively. Bees of C. hieroglyphica, Lasioglossum sp. and Seledonia sp. spent per flower. Foraging rate was higher in A. c. indica and B. picitarsus, while foraging speed was lesser in A. c. indica and P. oxybeloides. Nesting sites of different bee species and the common bee flora in the study area were also recorded.\\'sequences\\'Abstract: \"The circumscription and phylogenetic position of the tribe Durioneae (Bombacaceae or /Malvaceae/Helicteroideae) was investigated by supplementing a previously publishedndhF data set. The present analysis supports a narrow conception of Durioneae (excludingCamptostemon andPapuodendron) and confirms a close relationship withHelicteres, Reevesia, Ungeria, andTriplochiton (all of traditional Sterculiaceae). Phylogenetic relationships within Durioneae were inferred from a combined analysis ofndhF and ITS sequences. These data suggest thatNeesia is sister to a clade comprising all other five genera of core Durioneae, and thatCoelostegia +Kostermansia form a clade that is sister toCullenia +Boschia +Durio. Various morphological features support these relationships. However, characters usually considered diagnostic for the entirety of Durioneae, such as a densely lepidote lower leaf surface and uni- or polylocular anthers, appear to be apomorphic within this clade. Likewise, spiny fruits and large arils covering the seeds are not plesiomorphic for Durioneae, in contradiction to Corner\\'s classic Durian Theory. The phylogeny suggests that bat- and bird-pollination evolved from beetle-pollination and that this transition was coincident with extensive androecial modification. Similarities due to convergent evolution of floral traits in relation to pollination by birds and mammals probably account for the erroneous, traditional placement of Durioneae in Bombacaceae.\"Abstract: \\' This study showed that Themachhi is genetically very close to C. medica and consistently grouped with the typical citron in all the phylogenetic trees; hence revealed the identity of as a natural wild type of C. medica.\\'Abstract: \\'The present study aims to investigate the spatial and temporal variation of meteorological drought in the Parambikulam-Aliyar basin, Tamil Nadu using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) as an indicator of drought severity. The basin was divided into 97 grid-cells of with each grid correspondence to approximately of total area. Monthly rainfall data for the period of from 28 rain gauge stations in the basin was spatially interpolated and gridded monthly rainfall was created. Regional representative of SPI values calculated from mean areal rainfall were used to analyse the temporal variation of drought at multiple time scales. Spatial variation of drought was analysed based on highest drought severity derived from the monthly gridded SPI values. Frequency analyse was applied to assess the recurrence pattern of drought severity. The temporal analysis of SPI indicated that moderate, severe and extreme droughts are common in the basin and spatial analysis of drought severity identified the areas most frequently affected by drought. The results of this study can be used for developing drought preparedness plan and formulating mitigation strategies for sustainable water resource management within the basin.\\'Abstract: \\'This paper reflects on the impacts of agrarian change and social reorganisation on gender-nature relations through the lens of an indigenous group named the Kuruma in South India. Building upon recent work of feminist political ecology, I uncover a number of dualisms attached to the gender-nature nexus and put forward that gender roles are constituted by social relations which need to be analysed with regard to the transformative potential of gender-nature relations. Three main themes are at the centre of the empirical inquiry: gender subjectivities, rural off-farm employment and the human-nature nexus. I seek to show that, first, the production of gendered subjectivities cannot be simplified through essentialist assumptions that romanticise relationships with nature; second, off-farm employment strategies both reinforce the social hierarchy in gender and contradict the moral economies; and, finally, environmental and agrarian change redefine the use of agrobiodiversity and are related to ideas on progressive versus nonprogressive cultivation practices. The research is informed by qualitative research methods and offers a conceptual approach to the deconstruction of gender-nature relations from a poststructuralist feminist perspective.\\'Abstract: \\'The island of Madagascar ranks second to the neotropics in diversity of Bignoniaceae. Tribe Coleeae (Bignoniaceae) is a monophyletic group of tropical trees endemic to Madagascar and surrounding islands. The Masoala assemblage of Coleeae, in northeastern Madagascar, utilizes four mechanisms for avoiding competition via niche specialization: (1) morphologically via characters that comprise syndromes, explaining part of the pattern in this system although the syndrome concept is not perfect; (2) spatially via vertical stratification and potentially pollen placement; (3) temporally via phenological stagger; (4) ethologically via flowering duration and display. The 13 sympatric species of understory treelets and canopy trees did receive low flower visitor numbers. Contrary to the prevailing view of pollination systems where generalized systems predict equivalency between floral traits and pollinators, I found that different pollinators pollinated the 13 species of trees, that floral characters of different trees did not overlap in multidimensional phenotype space, and that few species of trees were visited by more than two pollinator groups. The use of multiple niches is potentially important in understanding both the origin and maintenance of tropical tree diversity.\\'Abstract: \\'The Swiss stone Pine (Pinus cembra L.) is an alpine species, fairly commonly occurring in the Alps and the Carpathians, close to the timberline. Natural sites of the Swiss stone pine in Poland are found exclusively in the Tatra Mountains, within the area of the Tatra National Park (TNP). In 2017, the health status of the needles of P. cembra was determined and their mycological analysis was carried out. As a result, 11 species of fungi were isolated from the needles showing disease symptoms, manifested by various shades of discoloration. The most frequently observed species was Fusarium oxysporum. It probably does not bring on disease symptoms, but may affect the development of other frequently isolated species (such as Sydowia polyspora, Lophodermium sp. and Lophodermium conigenum) that are pathogenic to Pinus spp.\\'callus of Decalepis salicifolia (Bedd. ex Hook.f.) Venter\\'Abstract: \\'Decalepis salicifolia (Bedd. ex Hook.f.) Venter is a new source of the commercially important flavor compound 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (2H4MB), a structural isomer of vanillin, with high pharmacological value and used as a flavoring agent at industrial level for making soft drink and bakery products. The natural availability of this high-valued plant is not able to meet the ever-increasing demands due to limited studies. Considering the importance of suspension culture over excised root culture, present communication provides a protocol for the suspension culture of root tuber derived callus of D. salicifolia for the first time. Maximum frequency (84.8%) callus induction was obtained on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium augmented with thidiazuron acetic acid (NAA). Two important biotic elicitors, chitosan (CH) and yeast extract (YE) at different concentrations (50, 100, 200 and were used as elicitor to investigate the effects on biomass content, 2H4MB content, total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and antioxidant activity in cell suspension culture with different contact periods i.e. 24, 48 72 and The results showed the supremacy of CH over YE and maximum biomass was 9.7 DW g/l at optimum contact period of when suspension culture was treated with CH. Maximum content of 2H4MB at CH and it was found to be 1.4-fold increase in relation to the control The maximum TPC and TFC were and respectively at CH and of the contact period. The DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity (RSA) had also been evaluated and most of the suspension culture showed the correlation with TPC and TFC. The maximum RSA (63.8%) and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (HRSA) (55.2%) were revealed the ability of plant as a potent antioxidant agent. Thus, a new protocol has been developed elicitors-induced enhancement of metabolites and antioxidant activity in suspension culture of D. salicifolia.\\'Abstract: \\'Year-round flowering is widely reported in fig trees and is necessary for the survival of their short-living, specialized Agaonid pollinators. However, seasonality in both fig and leaf production has been noted in almost all published phenological studies. We have addressed the following questions in the present study: (1) Are reproductive and vegetative phenologies seasonal and, consequently, related to climate? (2) Does Ficus citrifolia produce ripe figs year round? (3) Is the fig development related to climate? And, (4) Are reproductive and vegetative phenologies independent? By investigating these questions with a F. citrifolia population over a two-year period, at the southern edge of the tropical region in Brazil, we detected phenological seasonality that was significantly correlated with climate. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Trees became deciduous during the cold and dry months; (2) The flowering onset was asynchronous among individuals, but with moderate concentration during the hot and rainy months; (3) There was a correlation between the onset of flowering and vegetative phenology, with significantly higher crop initiations in individuals with full-leaf canopy; (4) Fig developmental time was longer in cold months; and (5) Ripe fig production occurred year-round and was not correlated with climate. Our results suggest that there are strong selection pressures that maintain the year-round flowering phenology in figs, for we have observed little seasonality in the phenology of such species despite the strong seasonality in the environment.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'A highly reproducible and efficient in vitro shoot regeneration system was developed in a potential medicinal plant, Albizia lebbeck using root explants. Root explants from 15 day-old-aseptic seedlings were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different concentrations (0.5, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 of 6-Benzyladenine (BA), Kinetin (Kn), 2-Isopentenyl adenine (2-iP) singly as well as in combination with acetic acid (NAA) (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 The highest rate of shoot multiplication (16.0 1.87 for the average shoot number and 5.16 0.38 cm for shoot length) was achieved on MS medium supplemented with 7.5 BA and 0.5 NAA. The effects of medium type, medium strength, pH and subculture on shoot induction and proliferation were also tested. An average of shoots per explants could be obtained following this protocol. Rooting was achieved on microshoots using half strength MS medium with 2.0 Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) after four weeks of culture. The in vitro raised healthy plantlets were successfully established in earthen pots containing garden soil and grown in greenhouse with >80% survival rate.\\'Abstract: \\'Microsatellite markers in small cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum Maton) were developed using the selective hybridization enrichment method. A total of 140 microsatellite repeats were identified from 270 clones. Primers were designed for 58 microsatellites and 44 primer pairs amplified products of expected size in cardamom. These markers were used for studying the diversity of 20 important small cardamom genotypes, and six markers were found to be polymorphic. The number of alleles ranged from 2 to 7 with an average of 3.6 per locus. Polymorphic information content values ranged from 0.14 to 0.38 based on dominant scoring. The two markers ECM 47a and ECMG 28 generated specific banding patterns for the genotypes MCC7 (Pink tiller) and APG434 (MA18) respectively. Dendrogram illustrated the genetic similarity between different genotypes of Kerala and Karnataka regions. It differentiated the closely related genotypes and released varieties into separate groups. Principal coordinate analysis revealed PV1 and ICRI 1 as the most divergent genotypes. The study demonstrated that these markers are informative and can be further utilized for generating reliable molecular data for assisting the crop improvement of small cardamom. Cross generic transferability of the developed primers proved that they are useful for phylogenetic studies in the family Zingiberaceae. This is the first report of de novo isolation, characterisation and utilization of microsatellite markers for the genetic diversity analysis of small cardamom.\\'Abstract: und auf Spaltrissen der Minerale,\\'Abstract: \\'How water should be managed in Monsoon Asia is emerging as one of the core earth system governance challenges. In this article, we explore the politics around pursuits of adaptiveness in water management, emphasizing the major transboundary river basins draining the south and eastern Himalayas. We look at two main functions: storing, diverting and sharing water for periods of scarcity; protecting people and places from destructive floods. We find that the pursuit of adaptiveness will take place partly outside the range of human experience in a context of large differences in exposure and vulnerabilities, disparate interests and unequal power. Anticipatory policies and actions to adapt and improve adaptive capacity to the transboundary impacts of changes in water-use, land-use and climate on water resources and services are still in their infancy; but several problem-framing discourses are emerging that have longer-term implications for water governance. It is not yet clear how these competing policy-frames will evolve in Asia. Much will depend on how systems of water governance develop. Public scrutiny of how governments in Asia plan to adapt to climate change in the water how risks of not enough and too much water are dealt need to continue to help sort out those projects and strategies which are driven primarily by political benefits from those which actually contribute to building adaptive capacities and maintaining social-ecological resilience.\\'Abstract: \\'The purpose of this study was to develop a protocol to induce high frequency of callus and subsequent plantlet regeneration for Pseudarthria viscida; an important medicinal plant. The cotyledonary node and young leaf pieces length breadth) were used as explants for callus induction and subsequent shoot regeneration and adventitious roots induction from the shoots. The best results were achieved on the following media: (1) callus induction from cotyledonary node explants on MS medium supplemented with 2, 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D) and 1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), (2) shoot regeneration from cotyledonary node derived calli with an average of 44.9 shoots per explant on MS medium fortified with N6-benzylaminopurine (BA) and NAA,37 (3) rooting with an average number of 3.3 roots per shoot on MS medium containing indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) or NAA after The plantlets were transferred to the field after acclimatization.

Approximately 7000 Soliga and 66000 non-Soliga people depend on the 540 km2 sanctuary for fuelwood. The demand for fuelwood is estimated to be 134.7 t d-1 or 49165 t y-1 against production of 66024 t y-1 for the entire sanctuary. Consumption patterns vary with the season and the altitude. The pressure for fuelwood is far greater on the fringe (85.8%) than in the core (14.2%). The fuelwood supply emanates from an activity zone of 20.1% of the total forest area which produces only 27% of the total demand. Furthermore, only selected species are preferred for fuel use, indicating that only a certain percentage of total productivity is available for extraction. Thus, the demandsupply gap is far greater than it actually appears. A wide gap between demand and supply demonstrates that the BRT forests cannot cater to the fuelwood needs sustainably with the prevailing patterns of extraction. Probable consequences of fuelwood extraction on biodiversity are discussed, and management options to meet energy requirement and to conserve biodiversity are explored.\\'Abstract: \\'Suspended and bed sediments collected from the entire region of the Krishna River and its major tributaries were analyzed for heavy metals (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pb) by the thin-film energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence technique. There is considerable variation in the concentration of elements towards downstream, which may be due to the variation in the subbasin geology and various degrees of human impact. Suspended particles are enriched in heavy metals throughout the basin relative to bed sediments. The heavy metals are enriched in coarse size fractions throughout the Krishna River except its tributary Bhima, where finer fractions (2 dominate. Transition elements correlate very well with each other. There is a striking similarity between the bed sediments of Krishna River and the Indian average. When the annual heavy metal flux carried by the Krishna River was estimated, and viewed in relation to the other major riverine transport, the Krishna is seen to be a minor contributor of heavy metals to the Bay of Bengal.\\'Abstract: \\'This is the first report of in vitro propagation and alkaloid accumulation in callus cultures of Ceropegia juncea Roxb. a source of drug in Ayurvedic medicine. Multiple shoots and callus induction was optimized by studying the influence of auxins [IAA (Indole-3-acetic acid), NAA (2-Naphthalene acetic acid) and 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid.)] and cytokinins [BA (6-benzyladenine) and Kin (Kinetin)] alone and in combinations. The best response for multiple shoot induction was obtained in nodal explants on MS medium supplemented with 7.5 Kin (8.5 3 shoots per explants). The shoots were rooted on half strength MS (Murashige and medium fortified with either IAA or NAA The plantlets were transferred directly to the field with 100 % success rate. Supplementation of MS medium with auxins and cytokinins enhanced the growth of callus but inhibited the shoot regeneration in nodal explants. Best callus induction and proliferation observed on MS + 1 2,4-D+5 BA. However the maximum cerpegin content (470 dry weight) was recorded in dried callus derived on MS+10 IAA+5 BA. Quantitative TLC (Thin layer chromatography) studies of the callus revealed a phytochemical profile similar to that of naturally grown plants. The calli were maintained by subculturing at 4 weeks interval on fresh parent medium over a period of 34 months. The optimized in vitro propagation and callus culture protocol offers the possibilities of using organ/callus culture technique for vegetative propagation and production of cerpegin alkaloid.\\'Management Effects on Litter Decomposition\\'Abstract: \\'To minimize the degradation of soil organic matter (SOM) content in conventional sugarcane cropping, it is important to understand how the fungal community contributes to SOM dynamics during the decomposition of sugarcane leaf litter. However, our knowledge of fungal diversity in tropical agroecosystems is currently limited. Thus, we determined the fungal community structure on decomposing sugarcane leaf litter and their response to different soil management systems using the internal transcribed spacer region 1 (ITS1) amplicon sequencing method afforded by Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM). The results indicate that no-tillage had positive effects on the relative abundance of Zygomycota and of some taxa that may prefer a moist environment over conventional tillage, whereas bagasse mulching decreased the richness of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and had positive effect on the relative abundance of slow-growing taxa, which may prefer poor nutrient substrates. Furthermore, a combination of no-tillage and bagasse mulching increased the abundance of unique OTUs. We suggest that the alteration of fungal communities through the changes in soil management practices produces an effect on litter decomposition.\\'Abstract: \\'The wide knowledge gaps in invasion biology research that exist in the developing world are crucial impediments to the scientific management and global policymaking on biological invasions. In an effort to fill such knowledge gaps, we present here an inventory of the alien flora of India, based on systematic reviews and rigorous analyses of research studies (ca. 190) published over the last AD), and updated with field records of the last two decades. Currently, the inventory comprises of 1,599 species, belonging to 842 genera in 161 families, and constitutes 8.5% of the total Indian vascular flora. The three most species-rich families are Asteraceae (134 spp.), Papilionaceae (114 spp.) and Poaceae (106 spp.), and the three largest genera are Eucalyptus (25 spp.), Ipomoea (22 spp.), and Senna (21 spp.). The majority of these species (812) have no report of escaping from cultivation. Of the remaining subset of 787 species, which have either escaped from intentional cultivation, or spread after unintentional introduction, casuals are represented by 57 spp., casual/naturalised by 114 spp., naturalised by 257 spp., naturalised/invasive by 134 spp., and invasive by 225 spp. Biogeographically, more than one-third (35%) of the alien flora in India has its native ranges in South America, followed by Asia (21%), Africa (20%), Europe (11%), Australia (8%), North America (4%); and cryptogenic (1%). The inventory is expected to serve as the scientific baseline on plant invasions in India, with implications for conservation of global biodiversity.\\'Abstract: \\'Climate change can be particularly hard-hitting for small underdeveloped countries, relying heavily on natural resources for the economy and livelihoods. Nepal is one among these countries, being landlocked, with diverse physiographical characteristics within a relatively small territory and with rugged terrain. Poverty is widespread and the capacity of people and the country to cope with climate change impact is low. The country is dominated by the Asian monsoon system. The main occupation is agriculture, largely based on rain-fed farming practices. Tourism based on high altitude adventures is one of the major sources of income for the country. Nepal has a large hydropower potential. While only 0.75% of the theoretical hydropower potential has been tapped, Nepal can greatly benefit from this natural resource in the future. Climate change can adversely impact upon water resources and other sectors of Nepal. The source of water is mainly summer monsoon precipitation and the melting of the large reserve of snow and glaciers in the Himalayan highlands. Observations show clear evidences of significant warming. The average trend in the country is per year. The warming rates are progressively higher for high elevation locations. The warming climate has resulted in rapid shrinking of majority of glaciers in Nepal. This paper presents state-of-knowledge on the glacial dynamics in the country based on studies conducted in the past in Shorong, Khumbu, Langtang, Dhaulagiri and Kanchenjunga regions of Nepal. We present recent trends in river flow and an overview of studies on expected changes in the hydrological regime due to climate change. Formation, growth and likely outburst of glacial lake are phenomena directly related to climate change and deglaciation. This paper provides a synopsis of past glacial lake outburst floods impacting Nepal. Further, likely impacts of climate change on other sectors such as agriculture, biodiversity, human health and livelihoods are discussed.\\'Abstract: \\'Information on landuse/landcover change is a critical input for natural resource management policy decisions. Remote sensing data under GIS domain were utilized to evaluate the changes in land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) spanning a period of thirty three years during 1975 to 2008 along the Dhansiri River channel, Assam, India. Seven different types of LU/LC were categorized and out of them cropland was evident as the most important landuse/landcover practices followed by dense mixed jungle in 1975 and the settlement in 2008. Significant reduction (13.02%) in cropland area to settlement was observed. Moreover, teagarden also occupies 0.77% of the total area from cropland and open mixed jungle. The changes in the areas of swampy land as evident from the present study in turn will impact the environmental quality around it and will help to increase the surface run off leading to enhancement of erosion processes. It is believed that the present study will help to contribute towards sustainable land-use planning and management towards protection of extremely rich biodiversity of the North East India with mighty Brahmaputra River system.\\'Abstract: \\'For forest ecosystem management to be effective, knowledge of the horizontal and vertical structural diversity of a forest is essential. The moist Afromontane highlands of Wondo Genet in south-central Ethiopia present an opportunity to restore and rehabilitate and enhance the ecosystem services to be obtained from this forest sustainably. We focused on the forest structural characteristics to better understand the current forest conditions to assist in the sustainable management of this resource. A total of 75 (20 m 20 m) quadrats were sampled and diameter at breast height (DBH) 2 cm and stem height 2 m were measured. Species identity and abundance, elevation, slope, and aspect were recorded for each plot. Structural characteristics were computed for each plot. Relationship of topographic factors with vegetation characteristics was conducted using R-Software. A total of 72 woody species was recorded. Whereas, the overall diameter distribution shows an inverted J-shaped curve, the basal area followed a bell-shaped pattern. Five types of population structures are revealed. The mean tree density and basal area was 397.3 and 31.4 respectively. Only 2.8% of the tree species have densities of >25 and the percentage distribution of trees show 56.2% in the DBH class cm, indicating that the forest is dominated by medium-sized trees. Celtis africana (8.81 and Pouteria adolfi-friedericii (5.13 make the highest contribution to the basal area and species importance value index. The families/species with the highest importance value index are Ulmaceae, Fabacea and Sapotaceae. Species abundance (r 2 =0.32, p <0.001) and species richness (r 2 =0.50, p <0.001) are positively related with tree density. Tree density is negatively related with elevation (r 2 p <0.001), slope (r 2 p <0.001) and aspect (r 2 p <0.05). While basal area is negatively related with elevation (r 2 p <0.001), it has a positive relationship with tree density (r 2 =0.28, p <0.001 and species richness (r 2 =0.098). Species with poor population structure should be assisted by restoration tasks and further anthropogenic disturbance such as illegal logging and fuel wood extraction should be restricted.\\'Abstract: \\'As forests undergo natural succession following artificial afforestation, their bird assemblages also change. However, interspecific avian social organization associated with forest succession has not been fully understood, particularly for mixed-species bird flocks. To disentangle how mixed-species flocks change as a function of local forest structure, we analyzed flock characteristics (particularly species richness, flocking frequency and propensity) and vegetation physiognomies along a presumed successional series (early, middle, and advanced) simultaneously in subtropical forests in southern China. As hypothesized, monthly point counts demonstrated that complexity of flocks increases with the progression of natural forest succession at a local scale. Advanced forests differed significantly from pioneering plantations with respect to vegetation structure, flock characteristics and constituents (especially for understory specialists). Importantly, forest succession affected flock patterns particularly in relation to the flocking propensity of regular species, and the frequency of nuclear species fulvetta Alcippe hueti), which in turn determined flocking occurrence at different successional stands. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that understory flocking species (mainly Timaliidae babblers) were significantly associated with intact native canopy cover, complex DBH diversity, as well as high densities of dead trees and large trees, representing a maturity level of successional stands. Our study reveals that the effect of natural forest succession on mixed-species bird flocks is species-specific and guild-dependent. From a conservation perspective, despite a high proliferation of pine plantation in southern China, priority should be placed on protecting the advanced forest with a rich collection of understory flocking specialists.\\'Abstract: \\'The highest percentage of shoot regeneration of Costus speciosus was achieved using thin rhizome sections and triacontanol (TRIA). Factors affecting the rate of shoot multiplication and rooting with TRIA have been investigated. Initiation of shoot buds was observed when rhizome thin sections were cultured on B5 basal medium supplemented with TRIA. Shoots with two to three leaves produced roots when cultured on B5 basad medium supplemented with 2 TRIA. The well-rooted shoots were hardened and transferred to soil where they showed normal growth and a 100% survival rate was achieved. Results of this study showed that TRIA can be used as an effective growth regulator in the micropropagation and conservation of C. speciosus.\\'Abstract: \\'Small freshwater fish species (SFFs) (length are highly rich in vitamin A, calcium, iron etc. and hence, can contribute to social health through nutrient supplement to rural communities. Under the pressure of extensive modern agricultural practices and indiscriminate harvesting, stocks of SFFs are gradually declining and their habitats and breeding grounds are also being deteriorated at faster rate. A better conservationist approach could be carp-SFFs integration which will reduce indiscriminate mass capture fishing of SFFs and will ensure conservation of natural SFFs stocks in their habitats providing economic benefit to stakeholders. Different studies have already showed success story of SFF polyculture through integration. This production cum conservation practice leads to better term in fishery is However, the part which needs attention is the feeding ecology of SFFs to understand within and between species (with carps) food partitioning and habitat preference as better culture cum conservational approach.\\'Abstract: \\'Compilation of alien flora from phytogeographically distinct regions is of immediate relevance not only for better understanding the patterns of plant invasion but also for explicating the processes promoting invasion at local, regional or global scales. Despite being at higher risk of invasion by plants because of its European colonial past, south Asia has received very little attention in respect of characterization of its alien flora. This paucity of baseline data necessitated compilation of the first catalogue of alien flora from the Kashmir phytogeographically distinct south Asian region nestled in the northwestern folds of Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. Total alien flora of the region is represented by 571 plant species, belonging to 352 genera and 104 families. It constitutes a relatively higher (29%) proportion of the total flora of the region. Families with largest number of alien representatives are Poaceae (60 species), Asteraceae (54 species), and Brassicaceae (30 species). However, families such as Amaranthaceae (83%) and Chenopodiacae (71%) show higher percentage of aliens relative to their total number of plant species in the region. Most of the alien plant species (38%) trace their origin to Europe, followed by Asia (27%) and Africa (15%). Present study also reports, for the first time, occurrence of seven plant species in this region. Each alien plant species is provided with information on the origin, habit, mode/purpose of introduction, current invasion status, altitudinal range and the primary published source.\\'Abstract: \\'The shifting baseline syndrome is a concept from ecology that can be analyzed in the context of ethnobotanical research. Evidence of shifting baseline syndrome can be found in studies dealing with intracultural variation of knowledge, when knowledge from different generations is compared and combined with information about changes in the environment and/or natural resources.\\'Abstract: \\'Although tropical rain forests represent the most species-rich terrestrial ecosystem on the planet, the three main rain forest regions (Neotropics, South-East Asia and continental Africa) are not equally diverse. Africa has been labeled the man because of its perceived lower species diversity when compared to the Neotropics or South-East Asia. Understanding why, within a biome, certain regions have higher or lower species diversity provides important insights into the evolution of biodiversity. I review the evidence in favor of an man pattern and the different hypotheses that have been advanced to explain and test this pattern using recent ecological, biogeographical and diversification studies. The man pattern has yet to be formally tested using extensive inventory plot data (including non woody species) between all three major rain forest regions based on appropriate statistics in an area controlled manner. The lower species diversity is not the result of a single cause, but is probably linked to numerous intricate causes related to present and past events. Future comparative studies should combine numerous variables including novel ones such at plant functional diversity. Finally, though more extinction in Africa is apparent from the fossil record, it is still hard to precisely quantify to what degree extinction varied between the three major regions. Diversification studies of important tropical plant lineages tend to support higher speciation rates in the Neotropics and South-East Asia instead of higher extinction in Africa as the main cause explaining the differences in species diversity. The lower species diversity of African rain forests remains an understudied question with numerous preconceived and largely untested ideas for which we are still far from having a synthetic explanation. This review highlights that there are still very little intercontinental rain forest comparisons of plant species diversity hindering any solid conclusions. To better address this, an integrative approach involving archeologists, climatologists and biologists coupled with data from all three regions should be privileged.\\'Abstract: \\'The launch of Cartosat-1 turns into a new era for user communities of remote sensing and mapping. Generation of digital elevation model (DEM) of a particular geographic region of interest is the primary goal and advantage of Cartosat-1 mission. To generate the most accurate DEM from Cartosat-1 stereo data, 34 GCP points were used, and 122 tie points are automatically extracted with the aid of LPS-2011. Here, an attempt has been made to study the quantitative hypsometric analysis of six sub-watersheds of the Kuttiyadi River Basin with a humid tropical setting, using Cartosat-1 DEM. An extension, CalHypso, an add-on tool to ArcGIS 9.2, was utilized to synthesize hypsometric data from Cartosat-1 DEM which reflects the erosional signature of sub-watersheds based on geological stages of development. From hypsometric analysis, it is found that three sub-watersheds are in old stage, and the remaining three are of mature stage.\\'Abstract: \\'Ridge top ecosystems (RTEs) are considered to be more sensitive to global warming as they are characterized by uniform sunlight exposure and low human interferences and hence are perfect places for monitoring and comparing the effects of climate change in species composition. The present study was carried out on RTEs of four different mountain ranges, viz. (1) (2) (3) and (4) along altitudinal gradient (situated below 2000 to above in Garhwal Himalaya to understand the variation in tree composition and distribution range. sample plot was used to analyze the tree species, whereas for saplings and for seedlings. The tree layers on RTEs were consisted of total 69 tree species, belonging to 55 genera and 39 families. Shorea robusta, Pinus roxburghii, Rhododendron arboreum, Quercus leucotrichophora, Q. floribunda, Q. semecarpifolia, Cedrus deodara, Pinus wallichiana and Abies spectabilis were found as the dominant and well-occupied tree species on the RTEs from lower to higher elevations. The mean stand density was recorded as trees (ranged between 546 and 616 trees with a mean basal cover of (ranged between 54.43 and A traditional pattern for tree diversity was recorded which decreased with increasing altitude. The detrended correspondence analysis ordination plot clumped the species together which shared the same habitat and environmental conditions which revealed that elevation and geographic location were the dominant factors for regional differences in species composition amongAbstract: \\'Soil moisture and its spatial pattern are important for understanding various hydrological, pedological, ecological and agricultural processes. In this study, data of rainfall and soil moisture contents at different depths (10 cm, 20 cm, 40 cm and 60 cm) in forestland and vegetable plot in the Taihu Lake Basin, China were monitored and analyzed for characteristics of soil moisture variation and its response to several typical rainfall events. The following results were observed. First, great temporal variation of soil moisture was observed in the surface layer than in deeper layer in vegetable plot. In contrast, in forestland, soil moisture had similar variation pattern at different depths. Second, initial soil moisture was an important factor influencing the vertical movement of soil water during rainfall events. In vegetable plot, simultaneous response of soil moisture to rainfall was observed at 10- and 20-cm depths due to fast infiltration when initial soil was relatively dry. However, traditional downward response order occurred when initial soil was relatively wet. Third, critical soil horizon interface was an active zone of soil water accumulation and lateral movement. A less permeable W-B soil horizon interface (40-cm depth) in vegetable plot can create perched water table above it and elevate the soil water content at the corresponding depth. Fourth, the land cover was an effective control factor of soil moisture during small and moderate rainfall events. In the forestland, moderate and small rainfall events had tiny influences on soil moisture due to canopy and surface O horizon interception. Fifth, preferential flow and lateral subsurface interflow were important paths of soil water movement. During large and long duration rainfall events, lateral subsurface flow and preferential flow through surface crack or soil pipe occurred, which recharged the deep soil. However, in more concentrated large storm, surface crack or soil pipe connected by soil macropores was the main contributor to the occurrence of preferential flow. Findings of this study provide a theoretical foundation for sustainable water and fertilizer management and land use planning in the Taihu Lake Basin.\\'Abstract: \\'Ecotones have received great attention due to its critical function in energy flux, species harbor, global carbon sequestration, and land-atmosphere interaction. This study investigated land use pattern and spatial heterogeneity of the ecotones among agricultural land, forest land, and grassland of the southeastern Da Hinggan Mountains in the northeastern China. The change of these delineated ecotones under different slopes and aridity conditions was analyzed by two landscape indices, edge density (ED) and core area percentage of landscape (CPL), to explore the inter-linkage between spatial structure of ecotones and socioeconomic development and land management. Specifically, the ecotones such as agriculture-forest (AF) ecotone, forest-grassland (FG) ecotone, and agriculture-forest-grassland (AFG) ecotone moved from the arid southeast to the humid northwest. The flat area with small slope is more edge-fragmented than the steep area since the ED decreases as the slope increases. The AF ecotone mostly found in the humid region is moving to more humid areas while the agriculture-grassland (AG) ecotone mostly found in the dry region is moving towards the drier region.\\'Abstract: \\'In the present study, a simple one medium formulation protocol for callus culture, somatic embryogenesis and in vitro production of alkaloids and diosgenin in Tribulus terrestris L. was developed. Extensive callus induction and proliferation was obtained in leaf explant on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 6 benzyl adenine (BA) and acid (NAA). The embryogenic callus was maintained on subculture to fresh parental medium at 4-week intervals over a period of The frequency of embryo formation was at a maximum per g of callus) on MS medium containing BA and NAA together with casein hydrolysate. Globular embryo developed into torpedo stage embryo under the influence of starvation. The accumulation of alkaloids (harmaline and harmine) and steroidal saponin (diosgenin) in non-embryogenic and embryogenic callus culture derived from leaf explant was compared with root, leaf, stem, and fruit of the mother plant. The embryogenic callus accumulated equivalent amounts of harmaline dry weight), harmine dry weight), and diosgenin dry weight) to that of the fruit of T. terrestris. The embryogenic callus culture of this species might offer a potential source for production of important pharmaceuticals.\\'Abstract: study quantifies biomass, aboveground and belowground net productivity, along with additional environmental factors over a period in Barnawapara Sanctuary of Chhattisgarh, India through satellite remote-sensing and GIS techniques. Ten sampling quadrates and were randomly laid for overstorey (OS), understorey (US) and ground vegetation (GS), respectively. Girth of trees was measured at breast height and collar diameters of shrubs and herbs at height. Biomass was estimated using allometric regression equations and herb biomass by harvesting. Net primary productivity (NPP) was determined by summing biomass increment and litter crop values. Aspect and slope influenced the vegetation types, biomass and NPP in different forests. Standing biomass and NPP varied from 18.6 to and 5.3 to respectively, in different forest types. The highest biomass was found in dense mixed forest, while net production recoded in Teak forests. Both were lowest in degraded mixed forests of different forest types. OS, US and GS contributed 90.4, 8.7 and 0.7%, respectively, for the total mean standing biomass in different forests. This study developed spectral models for the estimation of biomass and NPP using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and other vegetation indices. The study demonstrated the potential of geospatial tools for estimation of biomass and net productivity of dry tropical forestsuperensemble. The availability of datasets from the system research and predictability experiment initiated a forecast data archive, called THORPEX interactive grand global ensemble (TIGGE), makes it possible to use forecasts from a suite of individual ensemble prediction systems (member models) and to construct multi-model superensemble forecasts that are designed to remove the collective bias errors of the suite of models. Precipitation datasets are important for this study, we have used high resolution daily gridded rainfall dataset of India Meteorological Department (IMD), in addition to rainfall estimates from tropical rainfall microwave mission (TRMM) satellite and the CPC morphing technique (CMORPH). The scientific approach of this study entails the use of a multi-model superensemble for forecast and to verify against the rainfall information during a training phase, as well as during a forecast phase. We examine the results of forecasts out to day-10 and ask how well do forecast strings of day-1 through day-10 handle the prediction of the onset and duration of the breaks in the summer monsoon rains. Our results confirm that it is possible to predict the onset of a dry spell, around week in advance from the use of the multi-model superensemble and a suite of TIGGE models. We also examine trajectories of the parcels arriving in India in such forecasts from member models and from the multi-model superensemble to validate the arrival of descending dry desert air from the Arabian region during the dry spells and its mode of transition from wet spell. Some phenological features such as a shift in the latitude of the tropical easterly jet and changes in its intensity during break periods are additional observed features that are validated from the history of multi-model superensemble forecasts. Invariably this multi-model superensemble performs better than any single model in proving the better forecasts during our experiment period.\\'Abstract: \\'Belgaum city is a developmental hub of Karnataka State in India. In the recent time, the Government of Karnataka has planned to set up many processing industries in the vicinity of Belgaum to meet the growing needs of the region and to ease out the pressure on the already existing industrial hubs in Karnataka State. Ghataprabha, a tributary of river Krishna, is one of the major sources of water supply to Belgaum city and adjoining areas. During the last decade, a lot of anthropogenic activities such as unplanned agricultural activities are ongoing in many parts of the catchment. Therefore, people of Belgaum are more concerned about the quality of water in Ghataprabha river. Considering the significance of water quality of the river, surface water samples were collected during Pre- and Post-monsoon season from selected locations and analyzed for both physical and chemical constituents in the laboratory. The results indicate that the chemical parameters such as bicarbonates, sulphates, chlorides, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium are within the permissible limits. QUAL2E model was applied to assess the impact of point and non-point sources of pollution on the river water quality. Results show that the water quality conditions are highly acceptable all along the river stretch. Further, the variation of with river discharge was also estimated. Also, a significant variations in DO (decrease in DO) with the increase in river flow was observed. However, at the downstream end, considerable improvement in DO was noticed which is attributed to the damming effect of the reservoir.\\'Abstract: \\'Knowledge of the genetic diversity in the germplasm accessions is important for the efficient germplasm management. We studied 45 colored rice accessions, which had been earlier collected from peninsular India. The accessions were evaluated at two diverse locations for 12 morpho-agronomic traits and genotyped using 50 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Significant genotypic variability was observed for all morpho-agronomic traits studied. Dendrogram and principal component analysis based on morpho-agronomic traits separated the accessions into three clusters. The first two principal components accounted for 82% of the total variation. The most discriminatory traits were number of grains per panicle, biomass yield, and days to flowering and maturity. The SSR analysis revealed high polymorphic information content value of 0.84. Though, Mantel test did not show a significant correlation, yet the classification based on phenotyping and genotyping data showed good agreement for the expression of morpho-agronomic traits in the formation of clusters. Five accessions had high concentration of Fe and one of Zn. Our study revealed the presence of large genetic variation among the colored rice accessions evaluated and moderate agreement between morpho-agronomic and classifications and of these with geographic diversity.\\'Abstract: \\'This paper is intended to compute long-term spatiotemporal variability of precipitation on annual and seasonal scale of Damodar River Basin over the period of The lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient was applied to check serial dependence in the dataset. After this, non-parametric Mann Kendall and modified Mann Kendall test were used to identify trends and the slope method to estimate magnitude of trend line. Sequential Mann Kendall test was also applied to detect the potential turning point. Results found significant decreasing precipitation trend in annual and monsoon season over the basin except the southeastern part. The maximum decrease was found for annual and monsoon season at the northwestern part while minimum at the northeastern region. The sequential Mann Kendall test identified several non-significant as well as significant turning points for seasonal and annual rainfall at most of the locations.\\'Abstract: \\'The Himalayan zones, with dense forest vegetation, cover a fifth part of India and store a third part of the country reserves of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, the details of altitudinal distribution of these carbon stocks, which are vulnerable to forest management and climate change impacts, are not well known.\\'Abstract: \\'The present work accentuated the expediency of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) applications in groundwater studies, especially in the identification of groundwater potential zones in Ithikkara River Basin (IRB), Kerala, India. The information on geology, geomorphology, lineaments, slope and land use/land cover was gathered from Landsat ETM + data and Survey of India (SOI) toposheets of scale 1:50,000 in addition, GIS platform was used for the integration of various themes. The composite map generated was further classified according to the spatial variation of the groundwater potential. Four categories of groundwater potential zones namely poor, moderate, good and very good were identified and delineated. The hydrogeomorphological units like valley fills and alluvial plain and are potential zones for groundwater exploration and development and valley fills associated with lineaments is highly promising area for groundwater extraction. The spatial variation of the potential indicates that groundwater occurrence is controlled by geology, structures, slope and landforms.\\'Abstract: \\'Urdbean leaf crinkle disease (ULCD) is an economically significant widespread and devastating disease resulting in extreme crinkling, puckering and rugosity of leaves inflicting heavy yield losses annually in major urdbean-producing countries of the world. This disease is caused by urdbean leaf crinkle virus (ULCV). Urdbean (Vigna mungo L. Hepper) is relatively more susceptible than other pulses to leaf crinkle disease. Urdbean is an important and useful crop cultivated in various parts of South-East Asia and well adapted for cultivation under semi-arid and subtropical conditions. Aphids, insects and whiteflies have been reported as vectors of the disease. The virus is also transmitted through sap inoculation, grafting and seed. The loss in seed yield in ULCD-affected urdbean crop ranges from 35 to which is dependent upon type of genotype location and infection time. The diseased material and favourable climatic conditions contribute for the widespread viral disease. Anatomical and biochemical changes take place in the affected diseased plants. Genetic variations have been reported in the germplasm screening which suggest continuous screening of available varieties and new germplasm to search for new traits (new genes) and identify new sources of disease resistance. There are very few reports on breeding programmes for the development and release of varieties tolerant to ULCD. Mostly random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) as well as inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) molecular markers have been utilized for fingerprinting of blackgram, and a few reports are there on sequence-tagged micro-satellite site (STMS) markers. There are so many RNA viruses which have also developed strategies to counteract silencing process by encoding suppressor proteins that create hindrances in the process. But, in the case of ULCV, there is no report available indicating which defence pathway is operating for its resistance in the plants and whether same silencing suppression strategy is also followed by this virus causing leaf crinkle disease in urdbean. The antiviral principles (AVP) present in leaf extracts of several plants are known to inhibit infection by many viruses. Many chemicals have been reported as inhibitors of virus replication in plants. Raising the barrier crops also offers an effective solution to control the spread of virus.\\'Abstract: \\'Due to increasing trend of intensive rice cultivation in a coastal river basin, crop planning and groundwater management areimperative for the sustainable agriculture. For effective management, two models have been developed viz. groundwater balance model and optimum cropping and groundwater management model to determine optimum cropping pattern and groundwater allocation from private and government tubewells according to different soil types (saline and non-saline), type of agriculture(rainfed and irrigated) and seasons (monsoon and winter). A groundwater balance model has been developed considering mass balance approach. The components of the groundwater balance considered are recharge from rainfall, irrigated rice and non-rice fields, base flow from rivers and seepage flow from surface drains. In the second phase, a linear programming optimization model is developed for optimal cropping and groundwater management for maximizing the economic returns. Themodels developed were applied to a portion of coastal river basin in Orissa State, India and optimal cropping pattern forvarious scenarios of river flow and groundwater availability wasobtained.\\'Abstract: \\'Clado- and semogenetic approaches, when used in concert, make it possible to resolve questions concerning the phylogenetic relationships between group representatives, as well as the phylogenesis of those characters. Parental care patterns and other forms of reproductive behavior, along with the reproductive strategy as a whole, can be the subject of semogenetic analysis to no less an extent than morphological structures sensu stricto. One highly specialized form of parental care in fish, including representatives of the suborder of labyrinth fishes and their sister groups, appears to be parental food provisioning. In our view, the evolutionary origin of postembryonic brood provisioning in bony fishes is characterized by three main features: (1) in fish, different forms of postembryonic food provisioning are convergent in their origin; (2) any kind of brood provisioning is realized through exploitation of the already existing character and is maintained by selection due to an enhancement of offspring fitness; (3) the main evolutionary path of the emergence and development of this phenomenon consists in function expansion and replacement. The hypothesis does have heuristic power, since it enables prediction of the presence of the reproductive strategy component in question through the identification of adequate basic adaptations. Although parental care occurs in the majority of anabantoid fishes, there are still several species for which such care is not known. On the cladogram, these species by no means take the basal position but are surrounded by fishes that provide care for their eggs, or even their hatchlings. The parsimony principle leads to the suggestion that parental care is a plesiomorphic character in the suborder Anabantoidei (or in the order Anabantiformes). It seems that the ancestors of present day noncarrying species that take various positions within this phylogenetic group were fishes showing parental care. Their reproductive strategy later changed as a result of r selection. If this hypothesis is correct, the absence of parental care should be considered a case of reproductive strategy degradation. It is quite probable that parental food provisioning was a component of the ancestral reproductive strategies. It is also possible that the reproductive strategy of present-day anabantoids that supposedly do not care for their offspring actually includes some optional forms of parental care.\\'Abstract: \\'This paper looks at the crucial issue of dry-season groundwater-availability in the state of Maharashtra, India. We look at the two key hydro-climatological measurements which are used to implement groundwater policy in the state, viz., water levels in 5000 + observation wells across the state and aggregate rainfall data. We see that there is substantial variation in groundwater levels within and across the years in most wells. We argue that for a large number of these observation well locations, aggregate rainfall data is inadequate to model or to predict groundwater levels. For this, we use a novel random rainfall coefficient model for the purpose of modelling the effect of rainfall in a composite setting where extraction and changing land-use data is unknown. The observed high variance of this coefficient points to significant variations in groundwater levels, which may only be explained by unmeasured anthropogenic factors. Next, we see that the uncertainty in actual groundwater levels along with scarcity are two distinct features of groundwater availability and will elicit different behaviours from the typical user. Finally, we recommend that quantitative groundwater assessment protocols of the state should move to incorporating data from which extraction and land-use may be modelled. We believe this is one of the first studies where large spatio-temporal scale data gathered by state agencies have been analysed for scientific adequacy.\\'Abstract: \\'The performance of 11 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Climate Center (APCC) global climate models (coupled and uncoupled both) in simulating the seasonal summer monsoon rainfall variability over Asia (especially over India and East Asia) has been evaluated in detail using hind-cast data advance) generated from APCC which provides the regional climate information product services based on multi-model ensemble dynamical seasonal prediction systems. The skill of each global climate model over Asia was tested separately in detail for the period of and simulated Asian summer monsoon rainfall (ASMR) has been verified using various statistical measures for Indian and East Asian land masses separately. The analysis found a large variation in spatial ASMR simulated with uncoupled model compared to coupled models (like Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia, National Centers for Environmental Prediction and Japan Meteorological Agency). The simulated ASMR in coupled model was closer to Climate Prediction Centre Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) compared to uncoupled models although the amount of ASMR was underestimated in both models. Analysis also found a high spread in simulated ASMR among the ensemble members (suggesting that the performance is highly dependent on its initial conditions). The correlation analysis between sea surface temperature (SST) and ASMR shows that that the coupled models are strongly associated with ASMR compared to the uncoupled models (suggesting that air-sea interaction is well cared in coupled models). The analysis of rainfall using various statistical measures suggests that the multi-model ensemble (MME) performed better compared to individual model and also separate study indicate that Indian and East Asian land masses are more useful compared to Asia monsoon rainfall as a whole. The results of various statistical measures like skill of multi-model ensemble, large spread among the ensemble members of individual model, strong teleconnection (correlation analysis) with SST, coefficient of variation, inter-annual variability, analysis of Taylor diagram, etc. suggest that there is a need to improve coupled model instead of uncoupled model for the development of a better dynamical seasonal forecast system.\\'Abstract: \\'Mountain ecosystem, on the earth, has plenty of natural resources. In Himachal Pradesh all the rivers are snowfed and therefore rich in water resources. These resources have been supporting enough for the generation of electricity through introducing hydropower projects since the last decade. However, every developmental activity has its own negative impacts on the surrounding environment. Due to the fragile nature of topography and delicacy of ecology of the Himalaya, it results in lot of disturbances because of high degree of human interferences like construction of major hydropower projects. The increased extent of geological hazards, such as landslides, rock fall and soil erosion, have mainly due to alike developmental interventions in the natural ecosystem. So understanding and analysing such impacts of the hydropower projects have mainly been on the environment in various forms but natural hazards have been frequent ones. The present study, therefore, focuses mainly on the Parbati Stage II (800 MW) and the Parbati Stage III (520 MW) hydropower projects; both of which fall within the Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh. Based on the perception survey of the local communities, the existing land use pattern, status of total acquired land of the residents by hydropower projects, frequent natural hazards and resultant loss to the local communities due to upcoming construction of hydropower projects surrounding to the Parbati Stage II and III have been analysed in the paper. Also, the preventive measures to mitigate these adverse impacts have been suggested to strengthen these projects in eco-friendly manner in the mountain context.\\'Abstract: \\'A laboratory method used ion-exchange resins to extract phosphate ions from soils and to measure the rate at, and the extent to which, non-labile phosphate reserves in soils change into the isotopically exchangeable phosphate when the soils are allowed The method was tested on heavy and acid Indian soils, both unmanured and treated with NPK fertilisers.\\'lanuginosus (Gesneriaceae)\\'Abstract: \\' Corallodiscus lanuginosus is distributed across its boundaries, showing its highest morphological diversity in the Hengduan Mountains, Southwest China. We investigated the mechanisms behind the high diversity in this species. We acquired ITS sequence data across the distribution range of the genus, reconstructed dated phylogenies, projected the resulting clades onto geographic maps and linked the results with inferred ploidy levels of the populations. We found strong geographic patterns for the ITS clades but with extensively overlapping ranges, particularly in the Hengduan Mountains area. We deduced an origin of C. lanuginosus in the mid-Oligocene. We used the presence of ITS polymorphisms to infer a high level of hybridization events mainly in areas of clade overlap, where we also inferred repeated tetraploidization events to have taken place. Pre- and post-Quaternary climate oscillation-driven expansions and contractions of distribution ranges have allowed secondary contacts, hybridization and introgression that shaped the current patchy distribution of morphological diversity in the species. Polyploidization as a reinforcing genetic barrier added to the genetic diversity in space and time particularly in the Hengduan Mountains.\\'Abstract: \"Within the first 3 years the Bhaktapur Development Project has proved to work efficiently in spite of the difficulties and constraints being involved in the initial phase of such a complex undertaking.

Sixteen individuals were observed for a total of 2261 hours. Home ranges were measured for eight adult individuals and eight juvenile and subadult individuals. Males had significantly larger home ranges than the females, and home range size increased post-weaning.

The CSM reproduces the seasonal cycle as well as basic observed patterns of key climatic parameters reasonably well in spite of some limitations in simulation of the monsoon rainfall. However, while the seasonality in rainfall over the region is simulated well, the simulated area-averaged monsoon rainfall is underestimated to only about 60% of the observed rainfall. The centers of maxima in simulated monsoon rainfall are slightly displaced southward as compared to the climatological patterns. The cross-equatorial flow in simulated surface wind patterns during summer is also stronger than observed with an easterly bias. The transient experiment with a 1% per year compound increase in CO2 with CSM suggests an annual mean area-averaged surface warming of about over the region at the time of CO2 doubling. This warming is more pronounced in winter than during the monsoon season. A net increase in area-averaged monsoon rainfall of about largely due to increased moisture convergence and associated convective activity over the land, is obtained. The enhanced intraseasonal variability in the monsoon rainfall in a warmer atmosphere is confined to the early part of the monsoon season which the summer monsoon activity over India could also contribute to more intense rainfall spells over the land regions of the Indian subcontinent, thus increasing the probability of extreme rainfall events in a warmer atmosphere.\\'legumes and non-legumes\\'Abstract: \\'Litter decomposition and nitrogen mineralization were investigated in subtropical plantation forests in southern China. The CO2 release from incubated litter and the forest floor of Acacia mangium, Acacia auriculaeformis, Eucalyptus citriodora, Pinus elliotii and Schima superba stands were used to estimate relative rates of litter decomposition. Decomposition was not positively correlated with litter nitrogen. E. citridora litter decomposed most rapidly and A. mangium litter most slowly, both with and without the addition of exotic nitrogen. Aerobic incubation and intact soil core incubation at 30 over a period of 30 days were used to assess nitrogen mineralization of six forest soils. Although there were differences in results obtained using the two methods, patterns between legume and non-legume species were the same regardless of method. All soils had pH values below 4.5, but this did not prevent nitrification. The dominant form of mineral nitrogen was nitrate for legume species and ammonium for non-legume species. The nitrogen mineralization potential was highest for soils in which legumes were growing.\\'Abstract: \\'Soil depth generally varies in peak-cluster depression regions in rather complex ways. Because conventional soil survey methods in these regions require a considerable amount of time, effort, and consequently relatively large budget, new methods are required in karst regions.\\'Abstract: \\'The recovery of applied nitrogen by rice is low due to several loss processes operating in the ricefields. Split application of fertilizer suggested for increasing nitrogen-use efficiency is often not practical in rainfed lowland rice due to adverse situations. Hence, the entire required amount of N has to be applied in one single application when the water regime is favorable. A single broadcast application, however, increases N loss. Deep placement of urea supergranules (USG) has been proven to improve N fertilizer efficiency. The placement technology is best suited to conditions where the predominant N loss mechanism is ammonia volatilization rather than leaching or denitrification. Deep placement of USG thus has greater benefit over surface split application on soils with moderate to heavy texture, low permeability and percolation rate, and high cation exchange capacity and pH. Environments and management factors conducive to high ammonia volatilization potential would benefit most from deep-placement technology. Improved N recovery and efficiency of USG has been well-documented for lowland rice, but its market availability and methods to achieve placement pose problems. The technology has very limited adoption because USG is not commercially available or manufactured in most countries, and labor requirement is high with hand placement. Manual application creates more difficulties in handling the granules, besides taking more hours per hectare, than 2 split broadcast applications of prilled urea. Applicators developed so far have not worked satisfactorily under standing water conditions and in direct-seeded rice conditions due to hardness of the soil. Hence, it is necessary to develop a suitable applicator to overcome these difficulties. Alternatively, for direct-seeded rice, N-fertilizers can be subsoil-banded near seedrows. The placement technology, if adopted by the farmers of the potential lowland areas in eastern India, is expected to give an additional production of 5.6 million tons of rice.\\'Abstract: \\'The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater and its suitability for drinking water supply in Kangayam taluk, Tirupur district, Tamil Nadu, India. To achieve this objective, seventy-eight groundwater samples were collected from the wells spread over the study area during December 2016. The collected groundwater samples were tested in the laboratory for various hydrogeochemical parameters such as hydrogen ion concentration (pH), electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, carbonate, nitrate, sulphate and fluoride. The analytical results were compared with WHO drinking water standards to assess the suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes. To understand the spatial variation of hydrogeochemical parameters over the study area, choropleth (zonation) maps were prepared using geographical information system (GIS). Overall groundwater quality zones were demarcated by overlaying and integrating all the spatial plots using GIS. Three groundwater quality zones such as (1) most desirable, (2) maximum allowable and (3) not permissible were demarcated based on the limits prescribed by the WHO for drinking purposes. This study indicates that 49% of the study area does not possess potable groundwater. About 21% of the area represents category, and the remaining 30% area represents category for drinking purposes. The trilinear diagram indicates that groundwater of this region is Mixed CaMgCl type. As the groundwater quality is poor nearly 49% of the total area, it is necessary to go for treatment before drinking water supply.

Scientists from 17 countries have participated. This paper is one of a series that presents the results of that work. It provides a general review of GIS landslide mapping techniques and basic concepts of landslide mapping. Three groups of maps are considered: maps of spatial incidence of landslides, maps of incidence and forecasting of landslides and maps of assessment of the consequences of landslides. With the current era of powerful microcomputers and widespread use of GIS packages, large numbers of papers on the subject are becoming available, frequently founded on different basic concepts. In order to achieve a better understanding and comparison, the concepts proposed by Varnes (Landslide hazard zonation: a review of principles and practice, 1984) and Fell (Some landslide risk zoning schemes in use in Eastern Australua and their application 1992; Landslide risk assessment and acceptable risk. Can Geotech J 1994) are taken as references. It is hoped this will also add to the international usefulness of these maps as tools for landslide prevention and mitigation. Six hundred and sixty one papers and books related to the topic are included in the references, many of which are reviewed in the text.\\'Abstract: \\'Soils play an important role in the global carbon cycle, and can be major source or sink of CO2 depending upon land use, vegetation type and soil management practices. Natural and human impact on soil carbon concentration and storage is poorly understood in native north Australian savanna, yet this represents the largest carbon store in the ecosystem. To gain understanding of possible management impacts on this carbon pool, soil organic carbon (SOC) of the top 1m of red earth sands and sandy loams common in the region was sampled at 5 sites with different vegetation cover and site history (fire regime and tree removal). SOC was high when compared to other published values for savannas and was more comparable with dry-deciduous tropical forests. Sites sampled in this study represent high rainfall savannas of northern Australia (> annual rainfall) that feature frequent burning (2 in or more frequent) and a cycle of annual re-growth of tall C4 grasses that dominate the savanna understorey. These factors may be responsible for the higher than expected SOC levels of the surface soils, despite high respiration rates. Medium term fire exclusion at one of the sampled sites (Wildlife Park) dramatically reduced the grassy biomass of the understorey. This site had lower SOC levels when compared to the grass dominated and frequently burnt sites, which may be due to a reduction in detrital input to surface soil carbon pools. Exclusion of trees also had a significant impact on both the total amount and distribution of soil organic carbon, with tree removal reducing observed SOC at depth Soil carbon content was higher in the wet season than that in the dry season, but this difference was not statistically significant. Our results indicated that annual cycle of grass growth and wildfire resulted in small carbon accumulation in the upper region of the soil, and removal of woody plants resulted in significant carbon losses to recalcitrant, deep soil horizons greater than depth.\\'Abstract: \\'At an elephant camp in central Myanmar (Burma), we interviewed mahouts and veterinarians to describe the diet of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in a mixed-deciduous forest. Elephants showed a broad dietary breadth (103 plant species from 42 families); consumed mostly browse (94% of plant species); and were very selective about plant parts [e.g., many trees were eaten exclusively for their bark (22%) or fruits (14%)]. The fruits from 29 plant species were recorded to be eaten by elephants. Several of these were found as fruit remains, seeds, or seedlings in elephant dung, suggesting a role of Asian elephants in seed dispersal. Work elephants and their mahouts prove to be a rich source of information to understand wild elephant ecology.\\'expression profiles\\'Abstract: \\'A rapid in vitro propagation protocol for large-scale cultivation of Lagerstroemia speciosa L., an important medicinal and ornamental tree was established using nodal explants in Schenk and Hildebrandt (SH) medium optimized with various concentration and combinations of auxins and cytokinins. The study revealed, for the first time, accumulation of corosolic acid (CRA), an anti-diabetic and anti-obese pentacyclic triterpene in the in vitro plantlets. Multiple shoot induction was maximum in SH medium supplemented with Benzyl Amino Purine (BAP) and shoot initials, when transferred to SH medium supplemented with BAP, resulted in shoot multiplication and elongation. Rooted plantlets, after of hardening in mist-house and of rearing under shade-net, transferred to forest segments showed successful establishment In a short duration of ~2,450 hardened plantlets were obtained from a single nodal explant. The ISSR banding profiles of the regenerants and the mother plant were highly monomorphic and similarity matrix confirmed genetic fidelity of the clones. Chemical analysis using HPLC showed that CRA content is more in mature DW) than young leaves DW) of the in vitro derived plantlets. The differential synthesis of CRA in micropropagated and mother plant was studied using gene expression profiles. The expression of upstream rate limiting genes in terpenoid biosynthesis was relatively high in young leaves while downstream Cytochrome P450 hydroxylase (CYP450H), catalyzing the final step(s) in CRA synthesis, was more in mature leaf, suggesting a strong correlation between observed CRA variation and gene expression. The study signifies the role of in vitro methodology for true-to-type regeneration and its possible utility for biosynthesis of CRA, throughout the year.\\'Abstract: \\'60% of the ecosystems are not used in a sustainable way. Modern agriculture is blamed for declining soil carbon and biodiversity. Climate change, habitat fragmentation and other obstacles impede the movement of many animal species, and distribution changes are projected to continue. Therefore, we need alternative management strategies. The colony organisation of social insects, especially of ants, is seen as a model to design an improved agricultural management, because ants are very experienced agriculturists. Ants represent half of the global insect biomass. Their individuals work like a super organism. This article focuses on harvester and leaf cutter ants by considering Lasius species. It reviews the organisation structure of social ant communities. Harvester and leaf cutter ants represent a high percentage of the worldwide ant societies. They collect plant saps with carbon nitrogen (C/N) ratios of about 40 for their own nourishment and leaf fragments with C/N ratios of about 100 for fungi gardens and brood nourishment. They sustain huge numbers of individuals with their low N-based organic imports and their colony commensalisms enable them to convert these polymers into lower molecular, partly volatile compounds, adenosinetriphosphate (ATP), and heat. Digging improves water infiltration, drainage and soil aeration. Ants maintain fungi as a food source for the scleroproteinous brood, carry out food preservation, infection control and waste management, and construct with endurance new nests and rebuild them after damage. All these activities move the nest sites far away from the thermodynamic equilibrium. Physical, chemical and biological gradients emerge and the growing populations, together with nest-penetrating mycorrhized plant roots, absorb the released nutrients and form biomass by lowering energy flows into potentially strong consumer-resource interactions or runaway consumptions. The plant material import of leaf cutter ants, rich in carbon but low in proteins, amounts to kg dry weight per year. It keeps the electron donor/acceptor ratio in favour of the electron donor so that denitrifiers can reduce nitrate predominantly to N2. Ants living in highly N-polluted areas bind the pollutant in the cuticle. In their low N-input environments harvester, leaf cutter and honeydew-sucking ants furnish the N demand of adult ants with the help of N2-fixing bacteria. The low N-input management of harvester, leaf cutter and honeydew-sucking ants is therefore a resourceful concept for approaching a highly productive agriculture by avoiding soil carbon decline and N2O emissions increase.\\'Abstract: \\'Wild edibles continue to be a significant contributor to the global food basket in much of the developing world. A consensus has now been formed that information on wild edibles is an important part of ethnobotanical knowledge and hence elucidating region-specific patterns of habitat management and consumption assists policy making with regard to natural conservation, human nutrition, and human health. Using an original data set from Gujarat, India, the present research aims to document the collective knowledge of wild edibles possessed by the local Vasava tribe, as well as the habitat usage and consumption trends of these species.\\'Abstract: \\'A brief characteristic of three genetic groups of large and superlarge (lateritic, sedimentary, and karstic) bauxite deposits is presented. Their structure, composition, formation conditions, and localization patterns in the Phanerozoic history are unraveled. Climatic, tectonic, geomorphological, hydrogeological, and other major factors favorable for bauxite formation are scrutinized. It is shown that only the combination of these factors produces large deposits that can make up productive bauxite ore districts and provinces.\\'Abstract: \\'Lake Alemaya in the Ethiopian Highlands has historically provided the surrounding area with water for domestic use, irrigation, and livestock and has served as a local fishery tank. Increasing irrigation and domestic water use, change in the local climate and changes in the surrounding land cover are believed to be the causes of Lake demise. Expansion of major irrigated crops in particular chat (Catha Edulis), potato and vegetables and non-judicious use of irrigation water in the Lake Alemaya watershed led to presumption that irrigation is partly responsible for the withdrawal of large quantity of water from the lake. Thus, water balance study of Lake Alemaya was carried out under presumed scenarios in order to study the possible trends and fluctuations of the lake water level in response to proposed scenarios. Further, it is essential to study the irrigation performance for developing optimal irrigation schedules in the study area to make the best use of available water for long term sustainability of the water resources of Lake Alemaya. It was identified that expansion of the irrigated area in general and chat cultivation in particular in the study area have been the key to sustainable management of lake water, hence its expansion during the past was studied through interpretation of satellite data. Subsequently, performance evaluation of the small-scale irrigation practices for major irrigated crops was carried out. Optimal irrigation schedules for different crop seasons were also developed for these irrigated crops using CROPWAT software. It was found that chat area increased from in 1996 to nearly in 2002. Further, it was observed that 43% surface area of the lake has reduced within a span of Overall, maximum irrigation intensity of chat, potato and vegetables is observed during the first irrigation season of the crop calendar. Particularly, in case of chat, irrigation performance indicators such as Relative Water Supply (RWS), Relative Irrigation Supply (RIS), Depleted Fraction (DF) and Overall Consumed Ratio (OCR) values indicated poor performance of irrigation practices. From the analysis, it was found that the application of a fixed irrigation depth and fixed irrigation interval combinations of or are recommended for chat in the study area. Optimal irrigation schedules were decided on the basis of combination of irrigation interval and depth that results in low loss of irrigation water with reasonable yield reduction. Thus, determination of appropriate water management strategy can ensure proper utilization of the available water resources and improve the water application efficiency of the small-scale irrigation practices around Lake Alemaya, Ethiopia.\\'Abstract: \\'Watershed characterization and prioritization is carried out before taking up the task of management. Morphometric analysis plays significant role in prioritization of watersheds for proper use and various economic activities like animal husbandry. In the present study, morphometric investigations are used to ascertain plant growth potential of watershed for environmental management. Analysis was carried out in four sub-watersheds of information system (GIS) technique for determining plant growth potential. The analysis includes linear aspects, aerial aspects and relief aspects. Exhaustive data requirements and individual biasness for assigning weights to various morphometric parameters affect the prioritization process. Thus, Weighted Sum Analysis (WSA) method is used in the present study for identifying for potential plant growth. The maximum elevation in Shivganga watershed is in sub-watershed which increases stream flow velocity, erosion, minimized length of overland flow and quick water flow into streams contributing to hydrograph rise. It has been observed that sub-watershed 3 and 4 with low average slope show significant plant growth and contribute less runoff, relatively less land erosion and low peaks in hydrograph. The SW3 has highest potential for plant growth as it matches with the lowest weighted sum analysis. Thus, SW1 is given rank 1 with least compound factor value 1.317. The result illustrated that 13.64 to 45.40% of total area, falls in the good potential growth zone. The results of the work may be useful for watershed administrators and managers while planning conservation measures in the area.\\'Abstract: \\'Tropical and subtropical hilly vegetation in Himalayan regions are well suited for the taxonomical research because of the diverse habitat available in close proximity and the regions promote high species richness and endemism due to variation in slopes, soils, rocks, microclimate, exposure, latitude and altitude. Pteridophytes have evolved to fill the ecological niche between the angiosperms and the gymnosperms. During the course of recent study towards the pteridophytes of Nokrek Biosphere Reserve in eastern Himalaya, a few new taxa are described and geographical distribution extension of several previously reported species have also come to light. Studies based mainly on collections made during the last years have resulted in the revised description of the 19 species of lycophyta and ferns viz. Asplenium gueinzianum, Argostemma perakense, Asplenium sinense, Cyclosorus crinipes, Diplazium pseudosetigerum, Hymenasplenium cheilosorum, Lemmaphyllum microphyllum, , Lemmaphyllum rostratum, Loxogramme chinensis, Lygodium microphyllum, Microlepia hancei, Microlepia rhomboidia, Neocheiropteris zippelii, Pleopeltis macrosphaera, Pseudocyclosorus falcilobus, Pteris cadieri var. hainanensis, Pyrrosia lanceolata, Pyrrosia longifolia and Tectaria paradoxa from the Meghalaya state recorded for the first time. Full species citations, taxonomic notes, phenology time, chromosome counts, ecology, specimen studied, previously known distributions and citation records are given for all taxa. Recent collections show the richness of the flora of Meghalaya and permit more accurate taxonomic and phytogeographic comparisons with lycophyta and fern flora from adjacent areas.\\'Abstract: \\'India has reasons to be concerned about climate change. Over people depend on climate-sensitive sectors, such as rain-fed agriculture and forestry, for livelihood and over 973 million people are exposed to vector borne malarial parasites. Projection of climatic factors indicates a wider exposure to malaria for the Indian population in the future. If precautionary measures are not taken and development processes are not managed properly some developmental activities, such as hydro-electric dams and irrigation canal systems, may also exacerbate breeding grounds for malaria. This article integrates climate change and developmental variables in articulating a framework for integrated impact assessment and adaptation responses, with malaria incidence in India as a case study. The climate change variables include temperature, rainfall, humidity, extreme events, and other secondary variables. Development variables are income levels, institutional mechanisms to implement preventive measures, infrastructure development that could promote malarial breeding grounds, and other policies. The case study indicates that sustainable development variables may sometimes reduce the adverse impacts on the system due to climate change alone, while it may sometimes also exacerbate these impacts if the development variables are not managed well and therefore they produce a negative impact on the system. The study concludes that well crafted and well managed developmental policies could result in enhanced resilience of communities and systems, and lower health impacts due to climate change.\\'Abstract: \\'We examined the effects of treefall gap size and soil properties on microbial biomass dynamics in an undisturbed mature-phase humid subtropical broadleaved forest in north-east India. Canopy gaps had low soil moisture and low microbial biomass suggesting that belowground dynamics accompanied changes in light resources after canopy opening. High rainfall in the region causes excessive erosion/leaching of top soil and eventually soil fertility declines in treefall gaps compared to understorey. Soil microbial population was less during periods when temperature and moisture conditions are low, while it peaked during rainy season when the litter decomposition rate is at its peak on the forest floor. Greater demand for nutrients by plants during rainy season (the peak vegetative growth period) limited the availability of nutrients to soil microbes and, therefore, low microbial C, N and P. Weak correlations were also obtained for the relationships between microbial C, N and P and soil properties. Gap size did influence the microbial nutrients and their contribution to soil organic carbon, total Kjeldhal nitrogen and available-P. Contribution of microbial C to soil organic carbon, microbial N to total nitrogen were similar in both treefall gaps and understorey plots, while the contribution of microbial P to soil available-P was lower in gap compared to the understorey. These results indicate that any fluctuation in microbial biomass related nutrient cycling processes in conjunction with the associated microclimate variation may affect the pattern of regeneration of tree seedlings in the gaps and hence be related with their size.\\'Abstract: \\'The paper deals with the hydrochemical characterization and water quality assessment of springs emerging from the Archaean crystalline basements at the foothills of Western Ghat mountains in the highlands and Neogene sedimentary formations in the coastal lowlands of Kerala in south west India. A total of 19 springs from two important river basins of southern Kerala such as Ithikkara and Kallada river basins were studied for 18 physico-chemical (temperature, pH, electrical total dissolved dissolved total hardness (TH), Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, CO3 HCO3 SO4 , NO3 Fe2+, and ) as well as bacteriological parameters. The discharge computations show that free-falling type of springs in the area discharge about 256.23 million liters of water a year. A comparative study between the spring water samples of highland and lowland regions reveal that the quality of spring water, except pH and bacteriological contents, satisfies the standards set by the Bureau of Indian Standards and World Health Organization for drinking water. Spring water samples collected from the lowlands register high value of Na+ and compared with the highlands. Bicarbonate, Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ values are high in highland than lowland springs. The present study reveals that the spring water sources in the region can be developed as an alternate source for drinking water, provided pH correction and proper disinfection are done prior to its end use.\\'behaviour of the pest as possible causes\\'Abstract: \\'Hyposidra talaca (Walk.) is a major pest of tea (Camellia sinensis L.) in Northeastern (NE) India. The present study examined (1) the likely causes of expansion of H. talaca to tea from its ancestral home of sal forests, and (2) the anti-predatory mechanisms that helped it to build up in tea plantations. Studies were made on the role of the regulating agents of the eggs and caterpillars of the pest and responses of caterpillars to different predator-like stimuli (predatory wasps, ants and birds) and mechanical vibrations. Eggs collected from the fields were reared in the laboratory to study egg parasitization and monitored in the field to study the role of natural predators. Prolonged drought and inconsistent rainfall influenced the range expansion of H. talaca. In tea plantations, female moths preferred to conceal the eggs in the scaly bark of shade trees. Excluding woodpeckers, H. talaca eggs were scarcely attacked by other natural enemies. The caterpillars dropped off the plant in response to potential predators and assumed a deimatic or shape, and remained motionless when stimulated by mechanical vibration. This study suggests that the lack of specialized natural enemies helped H. talaca to build up in the tea plantations of NE India in a short period of time.\\'Abstract: \\'Dynamics of heavy metals such as Fe, Mn, Zn, Cr, Cu, Co, Ni, Pb, and Cd in surface water of Mahanadi River estuarine systems were studied taking 31 different stations and three different seasons. This study demonstrates that the elemental concentrations are extremely variable and most of them are higher than the World river average. Among the heavy metals, iron is present at highest concentration while cadmium is at the least. The spatial pattern of heavy metals suggests that their anthropogenic sources are possibly from two major fertilizer plants and municipal sewage from three major towns as well as agricultural runoff. The temporal variations for metals like Fe, Cu, and Pb exhibit higher values during the monsoon season, which are related to agricultural runoff. Concentrations of Ni, Pb, and Cd exceed the maximum permissible limits of surface water quality in some polluted stations and pose health risks. Dissolved heavy metals like Fe, Mn, Cr, Ni, and Pb exhibit a non-conservative behavior during estuarine mixing, while Zn, Cu, and Co distribution is conservative. Distribution of cadmium in the estuarine region indicates some mobilization which may be due to desorption. The enrichment ratio data suggest that various industrial wastes and municipal wastes contribute most of the dissolved metals in the Mahanadi River. The Mahanadi River transports 18.216 of total heavy metals into the Bay of Bengal and the calculated rate of erosion in the basin isAbstract: \\'Genetic uniformity is one of the most important prerequisites for successful micropropagation of crop species. Genetic fidelity of in vitro raised 40 plants of Ocimum basilicum L. derived from nodal explants was assessed by 56 RAPD and 17 ISSR markers, for their genetic stability. Out of 56 RAPD and 17 ISSR primers screened, only 31 RAPD and 11 ISSR primers produced clear, reproducible, and scorable bands. The 31 RAPD primers produced 92 distinct and scorable loci, with an average of 2.96 loci per primer. The number of scorable loci for ISSR primers varied from three (ISSR-BG09 and ISSR-BG11) to eight (ISSR-BG01), with an average of 4.81 loci per primer. The number of loci generated per primer was greater in ISSR than RAPD. The markers designed from AG motif amplified more number of loci. The markers anchored at ends produced a higher number of consistent bands than unanchored markers. All banding profiles from micropropagated plants were monomorphic and similar to those of the mother plant. A similarity matrix based on coefficient revealed that the pair-wise value between the mother and the in vitro-raised plantlets was 1, indicating 100% similarity. This confirmed the true-to-type nature of the in vitro-raised clones.\\'Abstract: \\'The current anthropogenic activities and climate change are increasingly becoming a growing global concern for dry tropical forests. Worldwide, these ecologically important forests have degraded considerably since the past few decades due to such factors. These factors have harmful consequences on the vegetation structure and diversity especially tree seedlings, which may further aggravate climate change. Generally, the vegetation recovery is very slow and unpredictable in the dry tropics due to complex interaction among tree seedling, site (particularly, soil) and climatic conditions. We inculcated that a better understanding of the behavior of individuals of different tree species at seedling stage in dry forests is of immense importance. It is increasingly being recognized for explaining and managing the future composition of plant communities under changing environmental conditions. In this regard, the multi-factorial interaction studies under various combinations are needed in dry tropical ecosystems to understand the: (1) impact of relative variability in resources and disturbances on the responses of tree seedlings of native species and (2) how the later relates to distinct functional and life history traits of the individual tree species. Most importantly, such studies would improve our limited understanding of how variation (natural and man-made) in nutrient availability, under the influence of other local environmental factors (such as water, light, grass competition, herbivory, fire, allelopathy and enhanced CO2 conditions), would affect the dynamics of dry tropical forest community. It may help in the proper management of these forests. Moreover, it may prove helpful in the current climate change scenario, as change in forest community dynamics may have consequences on soil C sequestration and CO2 efflux at global scale.\\'Abstract: \\'Agricultural drought has been a recurrent phenomenon in many parts of India. Remote sensing plays a vital role in real time monitoring of the agricultural drought conditions over large area, there by effectively supplementing the ground mechanism. Conventional drought monitoring is based on subjective data. The satellite based monitoring such as National Agricultural Drought Assessment and Monitoring System (NADAMS) is based on the crop condition, which is an integrated effect of soil, effective rainfall, weather, etc. Drought causes changes in the external appearance of vegetation, which can clearly be identified (by their changed spectral response) and judged using satellite sensors through the use of vegetation indices. These indices are functions of rate of growth of the plants and are sensitive to the changes of moisture stress in vegetation. The satellite based drought assessment methodology was developed based on relationship obtained between previous Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) profiles with corresponding agricultural performance available at district/block level. Palar basin, one of the major river basins in Tamil Nadu state was selected as the study area. The basin covers 3 districts, which contain 44 blocks. Wide Image Field Sensor (WiFS) of 188m spatial resolution from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) data was used for the analysis. Satellite based vegetation index NDVI, was generated for Samba and Navarai seasons in the years 1998 and 1999. An attempt has been made to estimate the area under paddy. It was also observed that, there was reduction in the crop area as well as vigour in the vegetation in both Samba and Navarai seasons in 1999 when compared with 1998. Drought severity maps were prepared in GIS environment giving blockwise agricultural water deficiency status.\\'Abstract: \\' Polypleurum stylosum var. laciniata of the family Podostemaceae, is an endemic aquatic angiosperm, which grows on rocks in fast flowing rivers and streams in Kerala (India). The plant body is thalloid and it lacks the conventional differentiation into root and shoot and is attached to the rocks with the help of rhizoids. Vegetative growth occurs in submerged conditions and lowering of water table triggers flowering. Flower buds appear along the thallus margin enclosed by a spathella and sustained by two or three pairs of bracts. The ovary lacks a distinct style and the stigma is characteristically bifid. There are two stamens with their filaments fused, which keep on elongating and mingle with the stigma at maturity. High and ratio indicate the high probability of plant establishment. Nearly seeds are produced in a fruit. The embryo lacks plumule and radicle. In tissue culture, the seeds germinate and produce a green radical which sticks to the hard substratum by means of the epidermal outgrowths. The main thalloid plant body originates from the hypocotyl region as a bulge and grows into a prostrate branchedAbstract: \\'Water scarcity was caused by many factors such as increase in demand of water, decrease in water availability and poor water quality. Bharathapuzha river basin in Kerala was taken for the study as it faces acute water stress during summer months. The water stress was calculated using two indicators: the water stress indicator (WSI) and blue water scarcity indicator based on blue water footprint (BWSI). In water stress indicator based on water footprint, three sectors: domestic, industrial and agriculture were considered. Water stress was calculated for 3 decades and Using WSI absolute scarcity was increased from zero to and water scarcity from 874 to in the decades. However, BWSI showed severe water scarcity in of area in all decades. This region falls on eastern side of the river basin. Comparing the results of the two indicators shows that two subbasins face severe water stress by using both the indicators. This study will help the planner to design proper water conservation measures to alleviate the water scarcity.\\'Abstract: \\'The deterioration of groundwater quality in Coimbatore district is principally attributed to the geological formations, application of agrochemicals and discharge of untreated industrial effluents. Groundwater samples were collected and analysed to obtain the hydrochemical characteristics for delineating the groundwater recharge and discharge zones. Alkaline water is present in the district during all seasons. Groundwater facies were evaluated and the majority of them were CaHCO3 and types. Generally, HCO3 was used to identify the recharge area and Cl the discharge area. Dominance of HCO3 in both water types helps in identifying the recharge zones. The TDS and major ions in conjunction with HCO3/Cl, SO4/HCO3, and Cl/T.anions were used in the delineation of areas. Results of geochemical modelling using PHREEQC were in agreement with the analysis of ionic ratios. Carbonate minerals are saturated in the recharge zone and become undersaturated as the flow progresses. HCO3 to Cl types for the recharge to discharge zones were confirmed by the aqueous speciation modelling. Gradual increase of NO3 along the flow path also supported the increasing anthropogenic influences towards the discharge zone. The spatial distribution diagrams drawn for each of these ratios suggested that a major part of the study area is covered by recharge zones. Mettupalayam and Pollachi taluks were found to be discharge zones. The results of the study showed that the water quality in the discharge zones is largely controlled by anthropogenic activities. The study gains importance since part of the water supply to the Coimbatore corporation area is from a source in the neighbouring state and the major surface water source of this area comes under an interstate water dispute.\\'Abstract: \\'Integrating targeted metabolic profiling with genetic diversity estimates is vital for selecting genetic stocks for breeding as well as mapping a biochemical trait. In Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC., copious amount of L-Dopa in seeds is viewed both as a boon and bane. Our objective of this work was to assess in conjunction both L-Dopa and genomic diversity in a selected set of germplasm to elucidate their relationship and identify parents for L-Dopa breeding/mapping. The findings revealed good genetic as well as metabolic (L-Dopa) diversity among the studied accessions. However, we could not establish direct relationship between these two as the marker data measured using AFLP and ISSR were not correlated with the seed L-Dopa contents. Based on the consensus information from both the data sets, seven parental combinations have been suggested. These findings are expected to pave way for genetic improvement as well as genetic mapping of L-Dopa trait besides integration of molecular markers in M. pruriens breeding programs.\\'Abstract: \\' Coscinium fenestratum seeds with initial moisture content showed germination over a period of incubation.

When fresh seeds were shade dried under laboratory conditions RH) for two days, moisture content was reduced to along with seed germination in a week. It was also observed that fresh seeds in polycarbonate bottles kept under laboratory conditions showed germination after of storage. Germination of C. fenestratum seeds can be controlled by phytohormones like GA3, IAA or ABA. When tested, GA3 and IAA excelled over ABA, in seeds with moisture content as well as in stored seeds.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Bamboo is among the important plants that help shape the socio-economic fabric of rural India.

Established in 2005, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is broadly considered to operationalize this to At the same time, a public discourse persists that views MGNREGA as a substitute for internal labour migration. Drawing on the results from 300 household surveys in three panchayats in the Krishnagiri district of Tamil Nadu, we test the validity of this discourse in this setting. We find that households that rely exclusively on MGNREGA have different demographic and socioeconomic characteristics compared to households that rely exclusively on remittances from internal labour migration. Furthermore, 20 per cent of households surveyed use both MGNREGA and internal labour migration as complementary livelihood strategies. We argue that there need for better understanding and recognition of the complementary potential of MGNREGA and internal labour migration.\\'Abstract: \\'Microscopic-coprological examination of Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus L., 1798) dung piles in South Wayanad Forest Division from March to August, 2017 revealed 74.5% prevalence of parasites in elephants. Ancylostoma sp. Anoplocephala sp., Strongyle type egg and Strongyloides sp. were the major parasites recorded. Strongyloides sp. and Strongyle type egg were observed more frequently (58.1%). Ancylostoma sp. and Anoplocephala sp. were constituted 1.8% each; mixed parasitic species infections were recorded. The frequency distribution of parasitic load in elephants showed skewed distribution of propagules. Centrifugal sedimentation and floatation methods of fecal examination of outer and inner regions of dung did not show significant difference in number of propagules. The highest number of parasitic propagules was recorded in floatation method. The number of propagules varied among dung samples of different herds collected from different localities. There were no relation between the parasitic load and age of elephants. The mean density of parasite eggs was higher in solitary animals epg) than herd elephants epg). Though parasitic load was higher in solitary males, based on the occurrence of parasites using logistic regression it was found that females had 1.83 times higher occurrence for parasitic infection than males. Both length and width of parasite egg size classes were used to classify into different taxonomic groups using discriminate function analysis. Three distinct size clusters were identified. Nematode and Cestode eggs were classified correctly with 95.7% accuracy. Since, the egg size was similar in nematode group separation into genus was difficult. Further, inclusion of stages of development of egg and larvae enable better separation.\\'spatial multi-criteria\\'Abstract: \\'Rainfall induced landslides are a common threat to the communities living on dangerous hill-slopes in Chittagong Metropolitan Area, Bangladesh. Extreme population pressure, indiscriminate hill cutting, increased precipitation events due to global warming and associated unplanned urbanization in the hills are exaggerating landslide events. The aim of this article is to prepare a scientifically accurate landslide susceptibility map by combining landslide initiation and runout maps. Land cover, slope, soil permeability, surface geology, precipitation, aspect, and distance to hill cut, road cut, drainage and stream network factor maps were selected by conditional independence test. The locations of 56 landslides were collected by field surveying. A weight of evidence (WoE) method was applied to calculate the positive (presence of landslides) and negative (absence of landslides) factor weights. A combination of analytical hierarchical process (AHP) and fuzzy membership standardization (weighs from 0 to 1) was applied for performing a spatial multi-criteria evaluation. Expert opinion guided the decision rule for AHP. The Flow-R tool that allows modeling landslide runout from the initiation sources was applied. The flow direction was calculated using the modified algorithm. The AHP landslide initiation and runout susceptibility maps were used to prepare a combined landslide susceptibility map. The relative operating characteristic curve was used for model validation purpose. The accuracy of WoE, AHP, and combined susceptibility map was calculated 96%, 97%, and 98%, respectively.\\'Abstract: \\' Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (Dennst.) Nicolson is a tuberous herb occurring in the wild and cultivated state. Vegetative morphological characters were studied at full foliage stage in 17 accessions of A. paeoniifolius which include two cultivars, 15 wild accessions and a related species, A. dubius Blume. The first principal component (PC) accounted for 42.32% of phenotypic variance followed by second for another 18.38%. Major traits that accounted for more variability in both PC1 and PC2 include offset shape, cormel weight per corm, corm fresh weight, petiole surface pattern and canopy spread. The unweighted pair- group method with mathematical averaging (UPGMA) clustering method revealed three principal clusters which separated all the accessions between Euclidean distances of Both cluster analysis and principal co-ordinate analysis revealed T10, a morphotype of A. paeoniifolius var. campanulatus (Decne.) Sivad. cultivated in Tamil Nadu and P19 accession of A. paeoniifolius var. paeoniifolius from Karnataka as morphologically distinct, which needs further validation on the basis of floral characters or molecular markers and G3 from Gujarat as an immediate ancestor of cultivated elephant foot yam. The genotypic (GCV) and phenotypic (PCV) coefficients of variation, broad sense heritability (h2B) and genetic advance (GA) as a percent of the mean assessed for 18 accessions revealed high heritability estimates. A highly significant correlation coefficient between circumference of petiole base and corm diameter, corm height, corm weight, east west spread and north south spread suggests that circumference of petiole and canopy spread are indicators to corm weight and size.\\'Abstract: \\'Remote sensing data and Geographical Information System (GIS) has been integrated with the weighted index overlay (WIO) method and E 30 model for the identification and delineation of soil erosion susceptibility zones and the assessment of rate of soil erosion in the mountainous sub-watershed of River Manimala in Kerala (India). Soil erosion is identified as the one of the most serious environmental problems in the human altered mountainous environment. The reliability of estimated soil erosion susceptibility and soil loss is based on how accurately the different factors were estimated or prepared. In the present analysis, factors that are considered to be influence the soil erosion are: land use/land cover, NDVI, landform, drainage density, drainage frequency, lineament frequency, slope, and relative relief. By the WIO analysis, the area is divided into zones representing low (33.30%), moderate (33.70%), and high (33%) erosion proneness. The annual soil erosion rate of the area under investigation was calculated by carefully determining its various parameters and erosion for each of the pixels were estimated individually. The spatial pattern thus created for the area indicates that the average annual rate of soil erosion in the area was ranging from to The high soil erosion probability and maximum erosion rate was observed in areas with high terrain alteration, high relief and slopes with the intensity and duration of heavy precipitation during the monsoons.\\'Abstract: \\'We studied the effect of triacontanol (TRIA) on shoot multiplication and rooting of in vitro derived shoot tips of Capsicum frutescens and Decalepis hamiltonii W & A. In both shoot multiplication and rooting phases, TRIA was administered at 2-20 TRIA resulted in highest promotion of axillary shoot proliferation at 2 in Capsicum frutescens and 20 in Decalepis hamiltonii while rooting was maximum at 5 and 10 for Capsicum frutescens and Decalepis hamiltonii respectively. TRIA enhanced shoot growth and chlorophyll content of leaves and also influenced root induction and supported growth of the roots. This work reveals that TRIA can be used as an effective growth regulator in the micropropagation of Capsicum frutescens and Decalepis hamiltonii, an endangered shrub of Deccan peninsular India.\\'Abstract: \\'The efficiency of GIS, RS and multi-criteria tools in isolating potential groundwater (GW) zones in the Kuttiyadi River basin (KRB), Kerala, has been robustly demonstrated by analysis of relevant data. To infer geohydrological makeup and consequent behavior of the KRB in respect of GW potential, firstly, various thematic layers viz. geomorphology, geology, slope, soil, lineament density and drainage density, were created. Secondly, thematic layers and their features were assigned suitable weights on the scale according to their relative significance for the presence and potential of GW. The assigned weights of the layers and their features were normalized using analytic network process method, and then the selected thematic maps were integrated in GIS using weighted overlay method to create the final groundwater prospect zone map. From the outcomes, the groundwater prospect zones of the KRB basin was found to be very good good moderate poor which constitute 24, 15, 26 and 35% of the study area, respectively. The GW prospect zone map was finally validated using geohydrology of area and GW level data from 43 phreatic wells in the study area. This study showed that groundwater prospect zone demarcation along with multi-criteria decision making is a powerful tool for proper utilization, planning and management of the precious groundwater resource.\\'Abstract: \\'Ticks are the important ectoparasites that occur on snakes and transmit rickettsiosis, anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis. A total of 62 snakes (Reticulated python, Indian Rock Python, Rat snakes and Spectacled cobra) were examined for tick infestation at Chennai Snake Park Trust (Guindy), Arignar Anna Zoological Park (Vandalur) and Rescue centre (Velachery) in Tamil Nadu from September, 2015 to June, 2016. Ticks from infested snakes were collected and were identified as Amblyomma gervaisi (previously known as Aponomma gervaisi). Overall occurrence of tick infestation on snakes was 66.13%. Highest prevalence of tick infestation was observed more on Reticulated Python (Python reticulatus, 90.91%) followed by Indian Rock Python (Python molurus, 88.89%), Spectacled cobra (Naja naja, 33.33%) and Rat snake (Ptyas mucosa, 21.05%). Highest prevalence of ticks were observed on snakes reared at Chennai Snake Park Trust, Guindy (83.33%), followed by Arignar Anna Zoological Park, Vandalur (60.00%) and low level prevalence of 37.50% on snakes at Rescue centre, Velachery. Among the system of management, the prevalence of ticks were more on captive snakes (70.37%) than the free ranging snakes (37.5%). The presences of ticks were more on the first quarter when compared to other three quarters and were highly significantAbstract: \\'We examined the carbon stock and rate of carbon sequestration in a tropical deciduous forest dominated by Dipterocarpus tuberculatus in Manipur, North East India. Estimation of aboveground biomass was determined by harvest method and multiplied with density of tree species. The aboveground biomass was between and the carbon stock ranged from 9.13 to across forest stands. Aboveground biomass and carbon stock increased with the increase in tree girth. The rate of carbon sequestration varied from 1.4722 to among the dominant tree species in forest stands in tropical deciduous forest area. The rate of carbon sequestration depends on species composition, the density of large trees in different girth classes, and anthropogenic disturbances in the present forest ecosystem. Further work is required to identify tree species having the highest potential to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere, which could lead to recommendations for tree plantations in a degraded ecosystem.\\'Abstract: \\'The influence of anthropogenic loading on the distribution of soft bottom benthic organisms of a tropical estuary (Cochin backwaters) was examined. The industrial activities were found to be high in the northern and central part of the estuary, where dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus (DIP > have caused high abundance of chlorophyll a (up to and accumulation of organic carbon in sediments (up to 5%). Principal component analysis distinguished three zones in the estuary. The central zone (Z1) was characterized by organic enrichment, low species diversity, and increased number of pollution tolerant species. Long-term deterioration of the estuary is indicated by an increase in the nutrients and chlorophyll a levels by sixfold during the last few decades. Flow restrictions in the lower estuary have lead to a fourfold increase in sediment organic carbon over the period of three decades. The reduced benthic diversity followed by an invasion of opportunistic polychaetes (Capitella capitata), are indicative of a stress in the estuary.\\'Abstract: \\'We mapped the forest cover of Khadimnagar National Park (KNP) of Sylhet Forest Division and estimated forest change over a period of 22 years using Landsat TM images and other GIS data. Supervised classification and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image classification approaches were applied to the images to produce three cover classes, viz. dense forest, medium dense forest, and bare land. The change map was produced by differencing classified imageries of 1988 and 2010 as before image and after image, respectively, in ERDAS IMAGINE. Error matrix and kappa statistics were used to assess the accuracy of the produced maps. Overall map accuracies resulting from supervised classification of 1988 and 2010 imageries were 84.6% (Kappa 0.75) and 87.5% (Kappa 0.80), respectively. Forest cover statistics resulting from supervised classification showed that dense forest and bare land declined from 526 ha (67%) to 417 ha (59%) and 105 ha (13%) to 8 ha (1%), respectively, whereas medium dense forest increased from 155 ha (20%) to 317 ha (40%). Forest cover change statistics derived from NDVI classification showed that dense forest declined from 525 ha (67%) to 421 ha (54%) while medium dense forest increased from 253 ha (32%) to 356 ha (45%). Both supervised and NDVI classification approaches showed similar trends of forest change, i.e. decrease of dense forest and increase of medium dense forest, which indicates dense forest has been converted to medium dense forest. Area of bare land was unchanged. Illicit felling, encroachment, and settlement near forests caused the dense forest decline while short and long rotation plantations raised in various years caused the increase in area of medium dense forest. Protective measures should be undertaken to check further degradation of forest at KNP.\\'HPLC\\'Abstract: \\'An in vitro protocol has been established for clonal propagation of Nothapodytes nimmoniana which is an important source of Camptothecin (CPT). Elite source was identified based on the chemical potency to accumulate the optimum level of CPT. Different types and concentrations of plant growth regulators were used to study their effect on inducing multiple shoots from the explants regenerated from embryos of N. nimmoniana. Of these, a combination of N6-benzyladenine and Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) proved optimum for differentiating multiple shoots in of the cultures with an average of 10.24 shoots per explant obtained within of inoculation. Nearly, of the excised in vitro shoots rooted on half strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing activated charcoal, supplemented with 1-naphthaleneacetic acid and IBA at each. The micropropagated plants were evaluated for their genetic fidelity by employing inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers. Ten individuals, randomly chosen from a population of 145 regenerants, were compared with the donor plant. The regenerated plants were also evaluated for their chemical potency using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of CPT content. The true-to-type nature of the micropropagated plants was confirmed based on their monomorphic banding profiles with that of the mother plants using ISSR markers. Besides, HPLC evaluation of the CPT content confirmed the existence of chemical uniformity among the regenerated plants and the elite mother plant.\\'Abstract: \\'Trace metal concentrations in the muscle of the bivalve Villorita cyprinoides from the Cochin backwaters (southwest coast of India) were investigated during the monsoon, post-monsoon and pre-monsoon periods. The seasonal average ranges of metals dry weight) in the bivalve were as follows: Fe Co Ni Cu Zn Cd and Pb The marginally elevated metal concentrations in bivalve muscles are probably related to high influx of metals as a result of pollution from the industries and agricultural fields with consequent increased bioavailability of metals to the bivalve. Evaluation of the risks to human health associated with consumption of the bivalves suggested that there is no health risk for moderate shellfish consumers. A regular and continuous biomonitoring program is recommended to establish V. cyprinoides as a bioindicator for assessing the effects of trace metal pollution and to identify future changes to conserve the of this fragile ecosystem.\\'Abstract: \\'Digital elevation model (DEM) derived conventionally from topographic maps and space borne satellites will provide various evidences about the change in earth features. It is one of the most fundamental data source of topographical relief information and delineate watershed boundaries which is being widely applied in numerous hydrological studies. A significant amount of work has been done to address the limitation and uncertainties of DEM. This review article aimed to bring all-inclusive considerations of DEM, i.e., derivative DEM sensors, types, accessibility, cost, horizontal & vertical accuracy and cell resolution. Based on evaluation this study would offer a good assistance to the research community and users for the implication of DEM services in appropriate hydrological models to avoid the ambiguities of modeling.\\'Abstract: \\'A participatory survey was carried out in five different agroecosystems of Bangladesh to obtain information on the genetic diversity, consumers preferences for fruit quality and to assess the data to select potentially superior genotypes of jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.). A wide variation in morpho-agronomic characters was identified from information and also from laboratory analyses. Multivariate analysis of the data produced four discrete groups, represented by trees from different agroecological zones and soil types. Characteristics such as weight; length; diameter; girth of fruits; number of bulbs per fruit; percentage of pulp; percentage of rachis (core); and percentage of rind (peel) were found to be poorly correlated with environmental factors indicating that these characters may be genetically controlled. Other characters, such as seed weight, bulb weight, and brix (%) were found to be affected by environmental and genetic factors. Isozyme analysis of 50 accessions confirmed results obtained from field studies of morpho-agronomic characters. Ten potentially superior types were selected on the basis of yield, fruiting season, flesh colour, texture, sweetness, and preference for recommendation to producers.\\'Abstract: \\'Numerous examples exist worldwide of partial or complete alteration to the natural flow regime of river systems as a consequence of large scale water abstraction from upstream reaches. The effects may not be conspicuous in the case of very large rivers, but the ecosystems of smaller rivers or streams may be completely destroyed over a period of time. While restoration of the natural flow regime may not be possible, at present there is increased effort to implement restoration by regulating environmental flow. This study investigates the development of an environmental flow management model at an icon site in the small river basin of Bharathapuzha, west India. To determine optimal environmental flow regimes, a historic flow model based on data assimilated since 1978 indicated a satisfactory minimum flow depth for river ecosystem sustenance is a value also obtained from the hydraulic model; however, as three of the reservoirs were already operational at this time a flow depth of is considered a more viable estimate. Analysis of daily stream flow in indicated adequate flow regimes during the monsoons in but that sections of the river dried out in with alarming water quality conditions near the river mouth. Furthermore, the preferred minimum flow regime expressed by stakeholders of the region is a water depth of which exceeds of the flood discharge in July. Water could potentially be conserved for environmental flow purposes by (1) the de-siltation of existing reservoirs or (2) reducing water spillage in the transfer between river basins. Ultimately environmental flow management of the region requires the establishment of a co-ordinated management body and the regular assimilation of water flow information from which science based decisions are made, to ensure both economic and environmental concerns are adequately addressed.\\'Abstract: \\'Roots and rhizosphere soils of Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn. ex Benth., A. mangium Wild., Artocarpus heterophyllus Lamk. C., Dalbergia sissoo Roxb. ex A. P. D., Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnn., Hevea brasiliensis (Wild. ex Juss) Muell. Arg., Swietenia macrophylla King. and Tectona grandis L. were collected from different locations of Madhupur forest area to study the biodiversity of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) fungal colonization and spore population. All the plants showed AM colonization. Out of eight selected plants, mycelial colonization was lowest in the roots of A. heterophyllus (22%) and the highest was in the roots of H. brasiliensis (78%). Mycelial intensity was observed poor and moderate in all plants species and abundant was in most of the plant species. Vesicular colonization was observed in five plant species. The lowest was recorded in E. camaldulensis (4%) and the highest was in H. brasiliensis (21%). Poor moderate and abundant type of vesicular intensity were observed. Arbuscular colonization was observed in three plants. The highest was in A. mangium (72%) and the lowest was in S. macrophylla (17%). Arbuscular intensity was recorded as poor moderate and abundant The highest AM fungal spore population was in A. auriculiformis (714) and the lowest was in D. sissoo (102). Five AM fungal genera were recorded. Glomus was found to be dominant. A few spores remained unidentified. Significant correlation was observed between percent colonization and spore population. The results of the present study indicate the occurrence of AM fungi and the mycotrophism of the plants of Madhupur forest area and the applicability of AM technology in the forest management of Madhupur forest.\\'Abstract: \\' Ophiorrhiza mungos is a herbaceous medicinal plant which contains a quinoline alkaloid, camptothecin (CPT), an anticancer compound. A high-yielding cell line, O. mungos cell line-3 (OMC3) was selected from cell suspension cultures of O. mungos using cell aggregate cloning method and established cell suspension culture. OMC3 cell suspension produced significantly high biomass fresh weight (FW)) and CPT yield dry weight (DW)) compared with the original cell suspension. Inoculum size of OMC3 cell suspension culture was optimised as Media optimisation has shown that (w/v) sucrose and an increased ammonium/nitrate concentration of favoured CPT production, whereas (w/v) sucrose, an ammonium/nitrate concentration of and of phosphate favoured biomass accumulation. Jasmonic acid, chitin and salicylic acid was used to elicit CPT production in the original cell suspension culture and achieved significantly high CPT production with jasmonic acid (JA) elicitation. Further, OMC3 cell suspension culture was elicited with JA and obtained DW CPT and FW FW). The combination of cell line selection and elicitation has produced 18.66-fold increases in CPT production together with significantly high biomass yield. The study is helpful in the scale-up studies of O. mungos cell suspension culture in suitable bioreactor systems for the production of CPT.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'We investigated the effect of forest thinning on soil nitrogen mineralization, nitrification and transformation in a Cryptomeria japonica plantation at high elevation to provide basic data for forest management. We chose four study plots for control, light, medium and heavy thinning treatment, and three sub-plots for buried bag studies at similar elevations in each treatment plot to measure the net N mineralization and nitrification rates in situ. The contents of soil inorganic N (ammonium and nitrate) were similar between treatments, but all varied with season, reaching maxima in September 2003 and 2004. The seasonal maximum net Nmin rates after four treatments were 0.182, 0.246, 0.303 and 0.560 in 2003, and 0.242, 0.258, 0.411 and 0.671 2004, respectively. These estimates are approximate with the lower annual rates of N mineralization for this region. Forest thinning can enhance net N mineralization and microbial biomass carbon. The percentage of annual rates of Nmin for different levels of forest thinning compared with the control plot were 13.4%, 59.8% and 154.2% in 2003, and 0.1%, 58.8% and 157.7% in 2004 for light, medium, and heavy thinning, respectively. These differences were related to soil moisture, temperature, precipitation, and soil and vegetation types. Well-planned multi-site comparisons, both located within Taiwan and the East-Asia region, could greatly improve our knowledge of regional patterns in nitrogen cycling.\\'Abstract: \\'Forty four superior jackfruit genotypes were collected from three districts of West Bengal, India based on jackfruit descriptor (2000). These genotypes were analyzed based on 19 important quantitative and 7 qualitative characters. From the analysis of genetic parameters, it could be concluded that characters like weight of fresh flakes without seed, weight of fresh flakes with seed, stalk length, fruit yield per tree, rachis diameter, rachis length, fruit length, shelf life, number of flakes per kg of fruit, flake width, number of seeds per kg of fruit, vitamin C, TSS/acid ratio and sugar/acid ratio could be used as selection criteria for development of effective and productive plant types in jackfruit. Further, these 44 genotypes were grouped into ten clusters for quantitative characters and eight for qualitative characters.\\'Abstract: \\'Object recognition is a challenging task in image processing and computer vision. In this paper, segmentation, feature extraction and classification methods are done for elephant recognition. Thresholding based segmentation technique is used for image segmentation and k-NN classifier is used for object recognition based on the shape features of the segmented image. Infrared elephant images are considered for experimentation. The database created by us for this type of object recognition includes elephant, bear, horse, pig, tiger, and cow and lion images. The recognition rate is calculated for performance evaluation. However, implementing such algorithms on software consumes more time as image sizes and bit depths grow larger. Hence this paper aims at hardware implementation of elephant recognition to reduce the computational time. The proposed hardware is prototyped inVirtex-4 xc4vlx25 FPGA using Xilinx System Generator (XSG) tool. The hardware/software co-simulation feature allows the input and output to be displayed on Matlab window while the processing is done through FPGA. The results indicate that when the category is elephant and if the recognition status is recognition rate is 100%. If the category is not an elephant and if the recognition status is recognition rate is still 100% also indicates, the approach is successful in elephant recognition and the computation of segmentation algorithm and shape feature extraction (area, centroid, equivdiameter) in hardware reduces the computational time of elephant recognition by 89.65% as compared to software computation.\\'Abstract: \\'The middle Andaman Island populations of Momordica cochinchinensis are quite distinct from true M. cochinchinensis in some floral characters. Such deviating specimens are described here as a new subspecies. A full technical description, a morphological comparison between the two subspecies, ecology, phenology, confirmation of genomic distinctiveness through DNA barcoding of matK and rbcL chloroplast loci and viability under cultivation are discussed. An epitype is also designated for Momordica cochinchinensis subsp. cochinchinensis.\\'Abstract: \\'An efficient micropropagation protocol based on multiple shoot induction and callus regeneration has been standardized in Sarcostemma brevistigma, a rare medicinal plant. The nodal cuttings were cultured on MS medium supplemented with BA or Kn alone or in combination with NAA Maximum multiple shoot induction was observed on MS medium supplemented with BA. On this medium, 100% cultures responded with an average number of 11.3 shoots per explant. However, the average shoot length was limited to only on this medium. The addition of NAA along with BA gave rise to an average number of 10.9 shoots with an average shoot length of Luxuriantly growing callus was obtained on MS medium supplemented with BA and 2,4-D The callus was subcultured on MS medium supplemented with BA or Kn alone or in combination with NAA for shoot organogenesis. Optimum callus regeneration was obtained on MS medium supplemented with BA and NAA. On this medium, 100% cultures responded with an average number of 13.4 shoots per culture. The shoots obtained via multiple shoot induction and organogenesis were rooted on half-strength MS medium supplemented with NAA or IBA IBA was better than NAA in terms of both the percentage of cultures that responded and the average number of roots per explant. The rooted shoots were successfully transplanted to soil with 86% success. This standardized protocol will help to conserve this rare medicinal plant.\\'Abstract: \\'Wayanad, one of the high range districts of the southernmost state of Kerala is a biodiversity hotspot region with rich endemic flora and fauna. It is well known for a wide variety of crops including specially scented rice, spices, ornamental plants, medicinal plants, subtropical fruits and vegetables. The district has been the home for majority of tribal population in Kerala. These tribal groups consume a large variety of wild leaves endemic to the area as a regular food supplement. Widely consumed leaves include those of Alternanthera sessilis, Talinum portulacifolium, Boerhaavia diffusa, Cassia tora, Colocasia esculenta, Achyranthes bidentata, Achyranranthus aspera, Alternanthera dentata, Amaranthus spinosus, Amaranthus viridis, Cyathula prostrata and Solanum nigrum. A comparison of the nutrient content of these non-domesticated leaves with amaranth (Amaranthus tricolor), the most commonly used leafy vegetable of Kerala has been attempted. Among all the WLVs studied, C. tora L. exhibited higher protein, fiber and vitamin C content than amaranth with significantly low nitrate and oxalate content. Different macro minerals like calcium, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and micro minerals like copper, zinc, iron and manganese were also found to be higher in most of these wild leafy vegetables as compared to those of amaranth. Since the wild leaves consumed by the tribal communities are rich in various nutrients especially the micro nutrients, attempts should be taken to conserve and promote these wild leaves for their sustainable utilization and to achieve nutritional security.\\'Abstract: \\'Leaching potential of pesticides, apart from climatological factors, depends on soil physical properties, interaction and chemical nature of the molecule. Recent investigations have revealed the presence of various organophosphate pesticides in various agroecosystems. The present study investigated the soil transport mechanism of commonly used organophosphate pesticides in acidic sandy clay loam soils of Kerala State, India. Packed soil column experiment was undertaken under laboratory condition for Unsaturated flow was carried out using distilled CaCl2 solution after applying chlorpyriphos and quinalphos at the rate of 0.04% and 0.025% respectively. The study revealed the retention of residues of chlorpyriphos and quinalphos in the top 5-cm layer. Irrespective of the applied concentration of chlorpyriphos and quinalphos, the relative concentration of the pesticides in soil was similar. About 56% of the applied chemicals were dissipated in of unsaturated flow. A new dissipation compound iron, tricarbonyl [N-(phenyl-2-pyridinylmethyene) benzenamine-N, was detected in GCMS analysis of soil extract from distilled water percolated soil. The dissipation of chlorpyriphos and quinalphos was faster in CaCl2-treated soil column. Among the pesticides analysed, the residue of quinalphos was detected in leachate.\\'plant\\'Abstract: \\'Embelia ribes, an important vulnerable medicinal liana, was regenerated through organogenesis and embryogenesis using leaf explants. Leaf explants produced organogenic calluses on MS medium supplemented with 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) and 6-benzylaminopurine. Shoot regeneration was obtained from organogenic calluses on MS medium containing different concentrations of thidiazuron (TDZ) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). The frequency of shoot bud organogenesis was highest (23.9 shoots/explant) in MS medium containing TDZ and IAA. The best result for induction of embryogenic callus was noticed in the combination of TDZ and 2,4-D. This callus, maintained in the same medium, showed the highest differentiation of embryos (56.5%) after of culture. Embryos were transferred to MS medium supplemented with different concentrations of TDZ, and this facilitated conversion of embryos into plants. After of subculture, MS medium with TDZ favored the highest percentage (52.2%) embryo conversion. As per the present protocol, 52.2% of the embryos underwent conversion, and a mean number of 29.5 shoots per culture was obtained. Shoots developed from both types of calluses were rooted on half-strength MS basal medium supplemented with indole-3-butyric acid. HPLC-UV assay demonstrated the highest embelin content (5.33% w/w) in the embryogenic callus cultures. Embelin was isolated from embryogenic callus and was identified using IR and 1H NMR studies.\\'Abstract: \\'Sapwood density and bark thickness of Calophyllum inophyllum L. (a multipurpose durable timber species) were studied in various locations in Northern Australia and in Sri Lanka. Measurements were taken non-destructively by using core sampling and bark gauge. From each provenance, mature trees having girth at breast height over bark (GBHOB) at cm were selected on the basis of the population size. Significant (p<0.05) hemispheric and provenance variations in bark thickness were found. Variations in the bark thickness are influenced by environmental variables. Variations in sapwood density were less pronounced compared to that of bark thickness. Variations in sapwood density are likely to be governed by genotypic variations.\\'Abstract: \\'To analyze the relationship between the management of three forest stand plantations and soil quality in the Dimapur district of the Northeastern Himalayan region, India, three forest soil profiles, covered by different species stands, at three depths were tested for 13 physical and chemical variables. Only four of these variables (electric conductivity, bulk density exchangeable Mg and available P) were included in a minimum data set, after using a varimax rotation algorithm in a principal component analysis, and subsequently used to calculate a soil quality index (SQI). Results showed higher SQIs in the surface layers depth) than in the deeper ones. Average weighed SQI varied significantly through the three considered forest sites, with the lowest value at site FS3. These findings reveal that the approach used here is suitable for preliminary screening of the impact of a forestry species on soil, to aid in species selection and improve soil health for afforestation and reforestation projects.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'Drainage morphometry provides quantitative description of the drainage system which is an important aspect of the characterisation of watersheds. Chalakudi River is one of the important rivers of the South India which has attracted attention of many environmental scientists recently because of the proposed Athirapally Hydel Project across the river. SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission) data were used for preparing DEM (Digital Elevation Model), Aspect Map and Slope Map. Geographical Information System (GIS) was used for the evaluation of linear, areal and relief aspects of morphometric parameters. The study reveals that the terrain exhibits dentritic and trellis pattern of drainage. The Chalakudi River Basin has a total area of and is designated as seventh-order basin. The drainage density of the basin is estimated as 2.54 and the lower-order streams mostly dominate the basin. The high basin relief indicates high runoff and sediment transport. The elongation ratio of the Chalakudi Basin is estimated as 0.48 and indicates that the shape of the basin is elongated. The development of stream segments in the basin area is more or less effected by rainfall. Relief ratio indicates that the discharge capability of watershed is very high and the groundwater potential is meagre. The low value of drainage density in spite of mountainous relief indicates that the area is covered by dense vegetation and resistant rocks permeated by fractures and joints. These studies are helpful in watershed development planning and wise utilization of natural resources.\\'Abstract: \\'Surface water quality assessment is a basic and critical tool for informing sustainable management of water resources. The aim of this study is to evaluate the reservoir and river water quality of the Cauvery River in the vicinity of the Krishna Raja Sagar Dam, Karnataka, India. The results will assist water management in the study area for varied future demands including, irrigation, industries, and river conservation. Ecologically important parameters such as dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, and physico-chemical parameters were analyzed. The results were compared with standard permissible limits. The differences in various parameters were statistically significant when comparing the upstream and downstream stretches of the river, particularly in summer. To identify a good technique for water quality assessment, all of the water quality parameters have been calculated by correlating various parameters and comparing them over two critical dry seasons. The dendrogram of the water-quality parameters clearly indicate that river water is safe for drinking, fishing, irrigation, and industrial purposes.\\'Abstract: \\'Spatial pattern of geomorphometric parameters of two sub-watersheds in the Attapady valley, Kerala, is evaluated using the Geographical Information System. Both the aspatial and spatial morphometric and hypsometric measurements of the sub-watershed are compared. The analysis of geomorphometric parameters coupled with DEM and GIS suggests that the two sub-watersheds are structurally complex with high relief and the denuded hills are undergoing severe soil erosion. Terrain analysis enables evaluation of landform changes in the two sub-watersheds which indicate differences in the denudational history of adjoining watersheds. It is demonstrated that the domainal variations in the lithology and structural complexity are reflected in differences in the denudational history which in turn is manifested in the geomorphic parameters. The study also helps in developing functional relationships between geomorphometric parameters and hydrological variables.\\'Abstract: \\'Hydrologic response of a catchment with the most common expression through runoff coefficient reflects a complex response of interaction between the rainfall and catchment physical properties. In this study, an attempt has been made through the mean polygon method to explore the impact of land use change on the mean monthly runoff coefficient estimated from of the hydrology and land use records of a tropical catchment located in the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Specifically, the land use and flow records are divided into three intervals: and The mean monthly polygon plotted is rendered to the three time intervals. The results have shown that contrasting shapes were computed which demonstrate the significant variability in the response characteristics under the linkage of land use changes. Ample information describing the hydrological responses of the study area has been attained through the quantitative approaches. The study has concluded that the polygon method can be used as a simple alternative method for assessing the impact of land use changes on the hydrological response.\\'Abstract: \\'The species of Ganoderma recorded from India as causing diseases of perennial crops are listed, and their host range and taxonomy discussed. Four new hosts of G. lucidum are also reported. A decline in productivity and the death of trees are the main economic impacts due to Ganoderma diseases, and the fungus is identified as a serious pathogen of cash crops, forest plantations and trees in natural forests in the country. Ganoderma diseases have been recorded on 144 hosts in India, the major pathogens being lucidum and G. applanatum. G. lucidum has been recorded on 91 hosts, and appears to cause the most widespread diseases. Identification has largely been made from morphological and cultural characters, and the names currently in use should therefore be treated with caution. Cultural methods of disease control are largely inefficient in minimising inoculum pressure and in reducing the disease incidence. Chemical methods in combination with soil amendments form short-term solutions for managing the disease and improving productivity. The immediate priorities for developing an efficient management system for Ganoderma diseases in India are: (1) a thorough understanding of the etiology and epidemiology of the diseases on different hosts, (2) clarifying current ambiguity in species names, (3) assessing the inter-relationships between populations of Ganoderma on different hosts and (4) developing tools for early detection of diseases in important crops.\\'Abstract: \\'A detailed study has been performed on the antioxidant activity of the acetone and methanol extracts of the stem bark of the plant, Shorea roxburghii. The total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of the extracts were determined by DPPH, radical scavenging, ferric ion reducing power, hydroxyl radical, ABTS. radical scavenging and hydrogen peroxide scavenging activities. Reducing efficiency of the S. roxburghii towards silver nanoparticles has been evaluated using surface plasmon resonance and transmission electron microscope. Spherical shapes of particles with nm have been reported. Formation of silver nanoparticles ascertains the role of the water soluble phenolic compounds present in S. roxburghii. Both acetone and methanol extracts of S. roxburghii stem bark was found to be a potent antioxidant. This work provides a scientific support for the high antioxidant activity of this plant and thus it may find potential applications in the treatment of the diseases caused by free radical. The extract of this plant could be used as a green reducing agent for the synthesis of Ag nanoparticles.\\'Abstract: \\'This study assessed land cover (LC) changes in and its environs by using multitemporal Landsat and ASTER imagery, respectively belong to 1989, 2000 and 2004. A priori defined nine land cover classes in the classification scheme were urban and built-up, forest, sparsely vegetated areas, grassland, vegetated stream beds, unvegetated stream beds, bare areas, crop fields, and water bodies. Individual classifications were employed using the combination of both unsupervised and supervised classification methods. Iterative Self Organizing Data Analysis (ISODATA) was used to reduce spectral variation in the scenes arising from complex pattern of crop fields. Maximum Likelihood classifier was used in the LC classification of the individual images. Image pairs of consecutive dates were compared by overlaying the thematic LC maps and cross-tabulating the LC statistics. Urbanization and expansion of agriculture were the major reasons for the dramatic LC conversions. The amount of conversion from crop fields to water occurred as large as accounting for 73% of the total land-to-water conversion. Conversions to agriculture have mainly been occurred from grasslands and sparsely vegetated areas as large as 1,314.95 and respectively. Urban coverage doubled in this period as a result of of increase. Urban area increased in the second period from 2,920 to Conversions to agriculture occurred at high amounts. A total of area changed from sparsely vegetated areas to crop fields. A landscape-level environmental monitoring scheme based on satellite remote sensing was proposed for effective environmental resource management.\\'Abstract: \\'Community Climate System Model (CCSM3), a coupled model developed by National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) containing atmosphere, ocean, sea-ice and land processes, simulation have been analysed for suitability in the Indian Monsoon region. A long control run of CCSM3 with constant forcing at every year has been done and the model climatology has been generated using of simulation. Atmospheric component of the model has been able to capture the large scale phenomena, however, regional monsoon variability not fully captured by the model simulation. A suitable modification in the flux coupler and the convective parameterization process in regional scale certainly improve the atmospheric part of the climate system. Another major component of the climate model is the representation of Land Surface Processes (LSP). A successful inclusion of LSP in climate model must address the issues related to the regional scale variation of the properties of LSP. A proper understanding of land surface processes is very crucial for climate simulations using numerical models. To understand the LSP-monsoon coupling, the offline Community Land Model (CLM), taken from CCSM3 land component, simulation forced with three hourly atmospheric boundary conditions have also been analyzed and compared with the CLM version of coupled CCSM mode. The distribution of surface heat flux in CCSM coupled mode shows some discrepancies compared to the offline CLM. Both the simulation results are compared with existing climatological features and assessment to improve CCSM3 for the regional climate change studies is made.\\'Abstract: \\'During a 5-yr study of lion-tailed macaques in their natural habitat, we found that: 1) most births occurred from January to April (70%) and from September to December (19%), showing a bimodal pattern with a major and a minor birth peak; 2) the period of peaks remained the same over 5 yr; and 3) a similar pattern of birth peaks occurred both in groups in large forest complexes that had overlapping home ranges with other groups and in single groups that were isolated in forest fragments in the same region but with similar ecological conditions. The results suggest more of a birth seasonality than mere breeding synchronization in the wild lion-tailed macaques. We also analyzed data on births in captivity in European Zoos for 10 yr. We observed no seasonality or peaks in births, and the pattern was the same over the years. Data on rainfall suggest that resource availability in the wild habitat may not be uniform throughout the year; hence, ecological factors may play an important role in determination of birth patterns in the natural habitats of lion-tailed macaques.\\'Abstract: \\'Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker was used to assess diversity in germplasm collection of Mucuna species which has gained tremendous attention in the recent past due to its promising nutritional, agronomic and medicinal attributes. Twenty five accessions comprising five species, collected from seven states of India were evaluated with twelve AFLP primer combinations that generated a total of 1,612 fragments with an average of 134 fragments per primer combination. The values of polymorphic information content (PIC), marker index (MI) and the resolving power (Rp) demonstrated the utility of the primer combinations used in the present study for discriminating the Mucuna accessions. UPGMA and Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of the genotypic data revealed clustering of accessions as per phenetic and genetic relationships. The similarity coefficient values suggested good variability among the M. pruriens accessions indicating their utility in breeding programs. Molecular diversity presented in this study combined with the datasets on other morphological/agronomic traits will be highly useful for selecting appropriate accessions for plant improvement through conventional as well as molecular breeding approaches and for evolving suitable conservation strategies.\\'Abstract: \\'Ophiorrhiza pectinata Arn. is an important medicinal plant reported to contain camptothecin which is used for the treatment of different types of cancers. The present study describes an efficient plant regeneration system through somatic embryogenesis. Embryogenic callus tissues raised from aseptic leaf explants were used for inducing somatic embryos under incubation of callus tissues at varying periods from 10 to It was noticed that callus tissues incubated between 30 and in 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid were responded positively in half-strength Murashige and Skoog liquid media supplemented with indole-3-acetic acid and started differentiation of globular structures in Maximum differentiation of embryos was obtained in callus tissues incubated for Clumps of embryos at different stages got differentiated into plantlets in MS media supplemented with 6-benzyl aminopurine and indole-3-acetic acid and produced an average of plants from 1.0 to callus tissues. The regenerated plantlets were successfully deflasked, hardened and established in paper cups filled with coarse sand and recorded more than 90% establishment under shade net house (50% shade) condition with adequate watering. The method of plant regeneration system developed would be useful for raising large number of plants and production of bioactive compounds.\\'Abstract: \\'A scarcity of cultivation land calls for more intensive and productive land use in the East Usambara Mountains in NE Tanzania. Spice crops could generate cash in higher parts of the mountains, but the present cultivation methods are depleting the valuable forest resources. The trial was established at the end of 2000 to find out how the two popular cash crops, cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum (L.) Maton.) and black pepper (Piper nigrum L.), normally grown under the natural forest, will produce in intensive agroforestry system with two multipurpose farm trees, Grevillea robusta A.Cunn. and nitrogen fixing Gliricidia sepium Jacq. Results from showed that cardamom produced better with grevillea than in natural forest; 5.5 times more in the fourth year than the average in the area. The Land Equivalent Ratios for black pepper and cardamom showed that pepper intercropped with grevillea produced 3.9 times more than in monoculture whereas cardamom intercropped with grevillea and pepper produced 2.3 times more than in monoculture. Gliricidia improved the nitrogen and organic matter content of the soil over the levels found in natural forest. Soil acidity was, however, preventing the plants from using the available mineral nutrients more effectively.\\'Abstract: \\'The paper presents the nature of variations of clouds and total ozone over Hyderabad India. The low-level cloud over Hyderabad has been noticed to occur for many days and nights, particularly in the months from June to September. The low level cloud occurrences were minimum in winter months. The effect of cloud occurrence on ozone concentration has been critically analyzed and explained. It has been observed that the concentration of ozone increased with the increase of cloud occurrence. The related possible chemical explanation for ozone production processes has been offered.\\'Abstract: \\'Knowledge on seasonal variation of morpho-sedimentary processes of tropical beaches is essential to evaluate inter annual variations to devising best protection strategy for the coastal zone. A study was taken up to understand the seasonal changes of physical processes at the headland bound and compared with exposed beaches. The spatio-temporal morpho-sedimentary dynamics were carried out through beach profiles, sediment samples, and simulated wave climates across two complete annual cycle. The beach profile survey was carried out using RTK-GPS, wherein the GRADISTAT was used for analysing sediment samples. The seasonal wave climates were studied with the SWAN model coupled with WAVEWATCH III. Observation shows, the sediment environment at headland bound beach is strongly dominated by fine sand throughout the year, whereas the exposed beach is illustrated from fine to medium sand across seasonal scale. The seasonal change in beach morphology occurs considerably in the exposed beach than that compared to headland bound. Successively, the occurrence of shoreline retreat is shown maximum up to in at the exposed beach during the monsoon. Both the locations showed strong seasonal variation in the wave energy as well as direction, whereas the nearshore wave energy at exposed beach is comparatively high with an average of 8342 J/m2 than the headland bound due to less deviation in the wave propagation. The analysis of seasonal wave pattern together with beach morpho-sedimentary processes exhibit the influence of wave conditions at the exposed beach when compared with headland bound beach and so the study implies for offset morphological changes and tailored management to protect the beaches from natural coastal hazards.\\'Abstract: \\'A novel protocol has been developed for inducing somatic embryogenesis from leaf cultures of Decalepis hamiltonii. Callus was obtained from leaf sections in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with acid (NAA)+N6-benzyladenine (BA) or 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)+BA. Nodular embryogenic callus developed from the cut end of explants on media containing 2,4-D and BA, whereas compact callus developed on media containing NAA and BA. Upon subsequent transfer of explants with primary callus onto MS media containing zeatin and/or gibberellic acid (GA3) and BA, treatment with zeatin and BA (10.65 resulted in the induction of the highest number of somatic embryos directly from nodular tissue. The maturation of embryos took place along with the induction on the same medium. Embryogenic calluses with somatic embryos were subcultured onto MS basal medium supplemented with zeatin+10.65 BA. After 4wk, more extensive differentiation of somatic embryos was observed. The mature embryos developed into complete plantlets on growth regulator-free MS medium. A distinct feature of this study is the induction of somatic embryogenesis from leaf explants of Decalepis hamiltonii, which has not been reported previously. By using this protocol, complete plantlets could be regenerated through indirect somatic embryogenesis or organogenesis from leaf explants in wk.\\'Abstract: \\'The nuclides, 228Ra and 226Ra, distributed into the soluble, suspended and sediment fractions in the river have differential inputs, both fluvial and technological. The high background contribution, enhancement due to industrial activities, and changes at the backwaters are highlighted. The solubilization-precipitation cycle at the backwater is discussed in relation to the seasonal inputs of fresh and saline waters, respectively, into the estuary. Sediment shift and subsequent solubilization of Ra from sediments during monsoon are the major geological phenomena responsible for its transport from the river to the coastal marine environment.\\'Abstract: \\'This study involves generation and logical integration of non-spatial and spatial data in a geographical information system framework to address the gap in national level soil organic carbon estimates. Remote sensing derived inputs and other spatial layers are corrected and integrated using same geographical standards. A relational data base of soil organic carbon density of Indian forest was prepared with attribute information. Hierarchical approach was followed to stratify and verify each sample from the data base using the corrected input layers in GIS and the resulting spatially distributed data is called Indian forest soil organic carbon database. The estimated mean soil organic carbon density for Indian forest is and varied from in Tropical thorn forest to in Himalayan moist temperate forest in the upper of soil depth. Due to large variations in the surface layers the estimated standard error ranged from to for the upper layer which is generally higher than the bottom soil layers. The level of detail in the data base helps to establish base line information for global, national and regional level studies.\\'Abstract: \\'Palaeoclimate and palaeoecological study was carried out using palynological and thecamoebian evidences buried in m vertically exposed sediment section (12 km inland from the present shoreline) of Late Holocene age along the banks of Gautami-Godavari River and from three shallow cores from its Nilarevu tributary, Andhra Pradesh. Inferred climatic periods include (1) a basal cold/arid period yrs BP) with dominance of Botryococcus and other fresh water algal remains coupled with abundance of 25 species of thecamoebians indicating shallow and lentic ecosystem during most of the period and (2) a relatively warm/wet conditions (since yrs BP) reveal lotic fresh water ecosystem characterized by the evidences of tree palynotaxa and low percentage of thecamoebians. The three shallow cores m) near the mouth km stretch) of the Nilarevu tributary reveal fluvio-marine deposition in the top cm sediment unlike the deeper fresh water depositional environment suggesting sea water ingression in the recent decades. The study illustrates that the Gautami-Godavari River delta gradually prograded since yrs BP until yrs unlike the intermittent relative sea level rise and fall recorded during the same period in the contemporary south-east deltaic areas.\\'Abstract: \\' Sporidesmiopsis zhejiangensis sp. nov. and Spadicoides americana were found on submerged wood from streams in Zhejiang Province, China. Sporidesmiopsis zhejiangensis is characterized by obclavate to fusiform, versicolorous, verruculose conidia with an apical mucilaginous sheath. Spadicoides americana is a new record to China. These taxa are described and illustrated, and morphological differences between these species and their similar species were summarized.\\'Abstract: \\'East Indian sandalwood (Santalum album L.) in commercial markets is highly prone to adulteration.

Seed dormancy and in this plant. An efficient method for plant regeneration via shoot organogenesis from callus cultures has been developed using nodal explants in H. isora. Murashige and Skoog (MS) media counting 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D, 2.26 to 13.57 Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, 2.85 to 17.13 Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA, 2.46 to 14.70 6-Benzylaminopurine (BA, 2.22 to 13.32 and Kinetin (Kin, 2.32 to 13.92 either singly or in the following combinations (IAA + BA; IAA + Kin, and BA + Kin) produced granular callus except BA + Kin which resulted in compact, hard, greenish-white (CHGW) callus. The optimum CHGW callus fresh weight/ explant) was produced on MS media with 13.32 BA + 2.32 Kin with over 93% callus induction frequency. Optimum shoot organogenesis (67% frequency) was achieved in CHGW callus with lower level of BA (2.22 and Kin (2.32 and produced 3.2 callus within of culture. Microshoots were rooted successfully (62% frequency) after of culture on 1/2MS containing 4.90 IBA and hardened off. Antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and biochemical parameters viz. hydrogen peroxide, reducing and nonreducing sugars, starch, proteins, phenols, and proline contents were studied in regenerating and nonregenerating CHGW calluses to establish a correlation between these parameters and shoot morphogenesis. All the enzyme activities and biochemical parameters were found more in regenerating callus than in nonregenerating except phenols.\\'Abstract: \\'The present study was conducted on the floristic composition, structure, diversity and biomass of understorey vegetation in the dry tropical forest of Achanakmaar Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve (AABR) of India using phyto-sociological analysis in each forest type by randomly laying ten sample plots of size. The herbs were enumerated for their girth and height in sampling plots. The structure, diversity and biomass of herb communities were analyzed at forest type level and the study found 2919 plant individuals belonging to 66 species, 62 genera and 31 families. The most important family as determined by the Family Importance Value (FIV) was Poaceae in herbs layer. In terms of Importance Value Index (IVI), the herb Arthraxon hispidus (Poaceae) was the most vital species in the herbaceous community. The present study revealed that the density of herbaceous community ranged from 0.40 to in various forest types, Basal area was recorded highest in Sal mixed forest and lowest was found in Bamboo forest The number of species in different forests varied from 14 to 32. Similarly, the Shannon index values in different forest types varied from 2.18 to 3.64, Simpson index values ranged from 0.045 to 0.17, the values of species richness from 16.69 to 30.52 and species evenness ranged from 0.81 to 0.95 in herb vegetation of different forest types. Shannon index values recorded in Sal mixed forest and Bamboo forest were found to be minimum. In contrary, Bamboo forest recorded maximum dominance of species as compared to other forests. Interestingly, beta diversity values ranged from 3.12 to 7.36 and it was observed to be highest in Bamboo forest and lowest in Sal mixed forest. However, the total herbaceous biomass varied from to The study recommends adopting intensive conservation measures especially in the open mixed forest and immature Teak plantations. In addition to it, encouraging and improving sal regeneration in sal mixed forests will not only help in reducing the biotic pressure but also in restoring and conserving the fragile dry tropical forest ecosystems of India.\\'Abstract: \\'In this study Malaprabha sub-basin is selected for evaluation of water resource in the basin, as there is decline in flow due to reduced rainfall over years and also due to increased activities in the upstream areas of the catchment. The study focused on evaluation of hydrological components for Malaprabha sub-basin using hydrological model known as soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). The model was implemented for Malaprabha sub-basin using digital elevation model (DEM), land use, soil and meteorological data etc. The model performance was evaluated by calibration and validation approach. The calibration and validation of the model was done by using the data for a period from It is found that R2 and NSE values are 0.67 and 0.69 during calibration and 0.73 and 0.60 during validation. The both coefficients are satisfying the model results and are used for evaluating the hydrological components for the basin. Finally, the spatial distribution maps were prepared for Malaprabha sub-basin for different hydrological components like water yield, evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, sediment yield and discharge. The results can be used for decision making purpose and further for planning of water harvesting structure.\\'Abstract: \\'The thermodynamic structure of the Convective Boundary Layer (CBL) over the Deccan Plateau, India has been investigated using aerological data during the summer monsoon seasons of 1980 and 1981. Conserved-variable analysis and the saturation-point approach, which were used in this study, suggest that the top of the CBL varied between mb during the monsoon. The air above the top of the CBL during a weak monsoon was estimated to have subsided for 4 days with a subsidence rate of 30 mb day-1.\\'Abstract: \\'Camptothecin is an important molecule in the synthesis of some of major anticancer agents such as irinotecan and topotecan. Traditional sources of camptothecin are mainly woody plants, some of which are being overexploited to a level that threatens the existence of the respective species. Alternate sources are being identified. In the current study, a tissue culture protocol was developed for the mass multiplication of Ophiorrhiza prostrata, an herbaceous camptothecin-containing plant, using seed explants, in order to evaluate its potential as an alternate source of commercial camptothecin. The germination of seeds was standardized on half-strength solid basal MS medium success rate). Seedlings subcultured on half-strength MS agar medium supplemented with benzylaminopurine (BAP) produced the most shoots from the nodal region of a single seedling. Mass multiplication of in vitro shoots was achieved by subculturing a single shoot as well as shoot clumps. Subculturing shoot clumps containing a minimum of shoots yielded fewer shoots per node than when single shoots were subcultured Shoot elongation was achieved on half-strength MS basal medium in a period of Various concentrations of auxins were tested for rooting, and NAA gave the highest number of roots Rooted shoots were successfully established under field conditions. High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) was employed to measure the camptothecin levels in wild-grown plants dry wt), in-vitro-regenerated plants dry wt), and in-vitro-derived hardened plants dry wt). The results of this study indicate that in vitro methods could be a potential path to the rapid expansion of plant biomass, which could serve as a potential source of commercial camptothecin.\\'Abstract: \\'The sustainable livelihood framework is a widely used approach to analyze changes in rural livelihoods, especially in resource dependent communities. The framework emphasizes that given a certain situation where the livelihood context, resources and institutions remain favourable, livelihood strategies carried out by people could possibly lead to two different outcomes. One, the results of livelihood strategies will produce sustainable outcomes providing affected households respite from the impacts of livelihood loss. Two, there is a possibility that resulting outcomes may not be sufficient to reverse livelihood crisis and may not necessarily result in sustainable livelihood because of the complexities, uncertainties and multilevel drivers associated with it. This paper aims to evaluate both these possibilities through use of empirical data to clarify factors and conditions that may impede sustainable livelihood outcomes despite well planned strategies. It highlights that availability of more resources (or capitals) do not necessarily contribute to more robust livelihood strategies or outcomes. Using the case of small scale fishery-based livelihood system of Chilika Lagoon, Bay of Bengal in the East coast of India, this paper suggests that the relationship between livelihood shocks and stresses, capitals, institutions and livelihood strategies is circular and not linear.\\'Abstract: \\'Delta regions of the Cauvery River basin are one of the significant areas of rice production in India. In spite of large-scale utilization of the river basin for irrigation and drinking purposes, the lack of appropriate water management has seemingly deteriorated the water quality due to increasing anthropogenic activities. To assess the extent of deterioration, physicochemical characteristics of surface water were analyzed monthly in select regions of Cauvery Delta River basin, India, during July 2007 to December 2007. Total dissolved solids, chemical oxygen demand, and phosphate recorded maximum levels of 1,638, 96, and respectively, exceeding the permissible levels at certain sampling stations. Monsoonal rains in Cauvery River basin and the subsequent increase in river flow rate influences certain parameters like dissolved solids, phosphate, and dissolved oxygen. Agricultural runoff from watershed, sewage, and industrial effluents are suspected as probable factors of water pollution.\\'Abstract: \\'Indian economy is vitally linked with the monsoon because of its water resources.

Historically the lagoon has undergone a considerable reduction in surface area due, in part, to input from natural processes but mostly due to human activities. The purpose of this investigation is to document the heavy metals\\' affinity for specific geochemical phases in the recently deposited sediments in the lagoon. Thirty-three samples were collected and analyzed for different geochemical phases of Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn utilizing a sequential extraction scheme. In the nonlithogenous fraction, the exchangeable fraction was not geochemically significant, having <2% of the total metal concentration for all the elements. However, the carbonate fraction contained the following percentages of the total concentration: <1% Fe, 13% Mn, 6% Cu, 4% Cr, 8% Ni, 13% Pb, and 12% Zn, suggesting the detrital origin of the sediments. Reducible and organic matter-bound fractions were the significant phases in the nonlithogenous fraction, containing 9% Fe, 16% Mn, 15% Cu, 16% Cr, 16% Ni, 14% Pb, and 14% Zn in the former and 4% Fe, 3% Mn, 17% Cu, 3% Cr, 14% Ni, 15% Pb, and 14% Zn in the latter. The phenomenon has been attributed to the scavenging affinity of Fe-Mn oxides and affinity for sorption into organic matter of the lagoon sediments. The lithogenous, residual fraction generally considered as a guide for natural background values was determined to contain 87% Fe, 67% Mn, 61% Cu, 77% Cr, 61.3% Ni, 56% Pb, and 60% Zn of the total concentrations.\"Abstract: \\'The ancient civilizations in India, China, Egypt and Mesopotamia have flourished due to large rivers that provided water for agriculture over millennia. Egypt was able to grow well because of the Nile. Similarly, Mesopotamia had two rivers namely the Tigris and the Euphrates. Likewise, India and China have several great rivers that continue to support the agrarian culture. This article discusses the sacred significance of rivers in the ancient and contemporary Indian culture with examples from popular Hindu scriptures. It also presents the ancient model of an eco-friendly check dam and its modern application with potential to mitigate future water-related problems across the drylands of India and elsewhere.\\'Abstract: \\'The concentrations of 27 major and trace elements are determined in surface water samples collected from 48 sites of diverse waterways in four states (Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Telangana) of South India. The aims of this study are to identify the element distribution, comparatively assess the pollution risk, and evaluate human health risks related to diverse waterways in the study area. The results indicate that elements such as Cr, Se, As, Fe, and Mn are the major pollutants, as their concentrations exceeded the acceptable national and international water quality standards in several sites of Ennore, Adyar, Cooum, Periyar, and Vrishabhavathi rivers. Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals that the Ennore, Adyar, Cooum, Periyar, and Kaveri river basins are affected by various anthropogenic activities, leading to moderate-to-high pollution by As, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Se. Potential pollution sources are industrial waste, sewage intrusion, paint industry waste, and automobile runoff. Overall, the investigated sites are categorized into three major groups: highly, moderately, and least polluted. Risk on human health by metals is then evaluated using hazard quotients (HQs) and carcinogenic risk evaluation; the results indicated that As with HQ >1 is the most hazardous pollutant, which could lead to non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic concerns, particularly in children. This study helps in establishing pollutant loading reduction goal and the total maximum daily loads and consequently contributes to preserving public health and developing water conservation strategies.\\'Abstract: \\'The IPSL-CM5A climate model was used to perform a large number of control, historical and climate change simulations in the frame of CMIP5. The refined horizontal and vertical grid of the atmospheric component, LMDZ, constitutes a major difference compared to the previous IPSL-CM4 version used for CMIP3. From imposed-SST (Sea Surface Temperature) and coupled numerical experiments, we systematically analyze the impact of the horizontal and vertical grid resolution on the simulated climate. The refinement of the horizontal grid results in a systematic reduction of major biases in the mean tropospheric structures and SST. The mid-latitude jets, located too close to the equator with the coarsest grids, move poleward. This robust feature, is accompanied by a drying at mid-latitudes and a reduction of cold biases in mid-latitudes relative to the equator. The model was also extended to the stratosphere by increasing the number of layers on the vertical from 19 to 39 (15 in the stratosphere) and adding relevant parameterizations. The 39-layer version captures the dominant modes of the stratospheric variability and exhibits stratospheric sudden warmings. Changing either the vertical or horizontal resolution modifies the global energy balance in imposed-SST simulations by typically several W/m2 which translates in the coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations into a different global-mean SST. The sensitivity is of about per when varying the horizontal grid. A re-tuning of model parameters was thus required to restore this energy balance in the imposed-SST simulations and reduce the biases in the simulated mean surface temperature and, to some extent, latitudinal SST variations in the coupled experiments for the modern climate. The tuning hardly compensates, however, for robust biases of the coupled model. Despite the wide range of grid configurations explored and their significant impact on the present-day climate, the climate sensitivity remains essentially unchanged.\\'Abstract: \\'It is generally perceived that landscape patterns or textures in a given protected area are spatially stationary. The findings of this study suggest that this common perception is only partially correct. Over the course of equilibrium in landscape shifting was detected using digital data for the Lassen Volcanic National Park (USA). Vertical aerial photographs taken of the park in 1941 were geo-referenced with the digital orthophoto quarter quadrangle (DOQQ) images of the same area from 1993 to identify landscape compositions and to measure change. Spatial analysis was used to observe pattern changes over time. The results suggested that landscape development maintained equilibrium while patches were in various stages of a successional sequence. The total area of each landscape component held steady, although over time patches throughout the landscape shifting-mosaic steady state (SMSS). These findings reflect the limitations of contemporary environmental conservation theory. They also suggest the importance of considering landscape change in policies that currently govern park planning and management.\\'Abstract: \\'India launched National Agroforestry Policy on 10th February, 2014 which has the potential to substantially reduce poverty in rural India and revive wood based industry, besides integrating food production with environmental services. The policy is not only crucial to ambitious goal of achieving 33 per cent forest and tree cover but also to mitigate GHG emissions from agriculture sector. Dynamic CO2FIX-v3.1 model has been used to estimate the carbon sequestration potential (CSP) of existing agroforestry systems (AFS) for simulation period of 30 years in twenty six districts from ten selected states of India. The observed number of trees on field in these districts varied from 1.81 to 204 per hectare with an average value of 19.44 trees per hectare. The biomass in the tree component varied from 0.58 to DM whereas, the total biomass (tree and crop) ranged from 4.96 to DM The soil organic carbon ranged from 4.28 to C The average estimated carbon sequestration potential of the AFS, representing varying edapho-climatic conditions, on farmers field at country level was C At national level, existing AFS are estimated to mitigate 109.34 million tons CO2 annually, which may offsets one-third of the total GHG emissions from agriculture sector.\\'Abstract: \\'Birth rate and immature survival rate in group living primates have been predicted to vary as a function of group size. These predictions were tested with data from a wild population of lion-tailed macaques in the Anamalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Tamil Nadu (India). Group size and composition, births, and mortality were monitored from eight groups for one to six years. The rate of growth of groups, birth rate, and survival rate were examined in relation to group size. The rate of growth of a group was a decreasing function of group size. Birth rate was also a decreasing function of group size and the number of adult females in the group. The sample size for survival rate of adults was too small to test for their dependence on group size. Immature survival was independent of group size, but the analysis was based on a very small sample. It is possible that the nature of dependence of net growth rate, birth rate, and survival rate on group size could be different outside the range of group sizes on which the analysis was based. The stronger relationship between birth rate and group size in the lion-tailed macaque, in relation to other primates, might be the result of its low birth rate as well as the relatively low temporal variation in resources in the rain forest. Limited data available from other sites indicate that the observed relationship between birth rate and group size might be spatially stable.\\'Abstract: \\'An optimized method was devised for asymbiotic seed germination, seedling development and field establishment of Eulophia nuda Lindl., an endangered orchid with tremendous therapeutic potentialities. Seeds of different ages were germinated on half and full strength MS (Murashige and Skoog), KC (Knudson) and BM1 (Van Waes and Debergh) media. Amongst various coconut water (CW) and casein hydrolysate proved beneficial for seed germination. BM1 fortified with CW showed the highest germination after of inoculation, which was further improved to upon incorporation of each of acid (NAA) and 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and eventually cultures developed into seedlings. nourished with BAP and Kin (kinetin) proved best for multiple shoot induction from seedlings. Shoot numbers further increased with each successive transfer onto the same medium. Sixty shoots per shoot clump were achieved after four cycles of each. Microshoots were rooted on MS containing indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and activated charcoal. Rooted plantlets were gradually acclimatized to greenhouse survival) and they exhibited normal morphology and growth characteristics. Flow-cytometry based DNA content analysis revealed that the ploidy levels were maintained in in-vitropropagated plants.\\'Abstract: \\'Anuran diversity study was conducted for between June 2008 and August 2009 at Durgapur, an industrial city of West Bengal, India. Nine species under four families of the Order Anura were found to occur in Durgapur. They have a wide range of habitat preference like permanent or temporary aquatic bodies, human residential area, forested areas, termite nest, tree hole, under spaces of logs and so forth.

The closely related dahat (Tectona hamiltoniana Wall.) is an endemic tree species confined to Myanmar. Two chloroplast Simple Sequence Repeat (cpSSR) and sixty-nine Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers were applied to assess patterns of genetic variation in four T. grandis and three T. hamiltoniana populations in Myanmar. The cpSSR analysis confirmed a clear genetic differentiation between species, revealing a single haplotype (H1) in T. grandis, while the three T. hamiltoniana populations were fixed on different haplotypes (H2 or H3). AFLP analysis revealed that genetic diversity varied between species, showing a slightly higher variation in T. grandis than in T. hamiltoniana. The T. hamiltoniana populations showed similar levels of genetic variation, while parameters varied considerably in T. grandis populations. Analyses of Molecular Variance revealed significant genetic differentiation between the two species and among populations within species. Genetic variation mainly resided within populations. Significant pairwise genetic differentiation (pairwise F  ST ) was detected between most populations An Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean dendrogram based on genetic distances revealed a clear genetic differentiation between species. Diagnostic AFLP markers with complete or nearly complete differentiation between species and complete differentiation at cpDNA markers indicated strong phylogenetic divergence between teak and dahat.\\'Abstract: city, the economical capital of India, is located on the west coast of stable intra-plate continental region of Peninsular India which has an experience of significant historical earthquakes in the past. The city stood as the fourth most populous city in the world. Recent seismo-tectonic studies of this city highlighted the presence of active West coast fault and Chiplun fault beneath the Deccan basalt. In the present study, spatial variability of probabilistic seismic hazard for Mumbai region (latitudes of and longitudes of at a grid spacing of which includes Mumbai city, Suburban, part of Thane district and Navi Mumbai, in terms of ground motion parameters; peak horizontal acceleration and spectral acceleration at 1.0-s period for 2 and probability of exceedance in are generated. The epistemic uncertainty in hazard estimation is accounted by employing seven different ground motion prediction equations developed for worldwide shallow crustal intra-plate environments. Further, the seismic hazard results are deaggregated for Mumbai (latitude longitude to understand the relative contributions of earthquake sources in terms of magnitude and distance. The generated hazard maps are compared with the zoning specified by Indian seismic code (IS1893: Part 1 in Indian standard criteria for earthquake-resistant design of structures, Part provisions and buildings. Bureau of Indian Standards, New Delhi, India, 2002) for rocky site. Present results show an underestimation of potential seismic hazard in the entire study region by non-probabilistic zoning prescribed by IS1893: Part 1 with significantly higher seismic hazard values in the southern part of Navi Mumbai.\\'Abstract: \\'The present study indicates that coastal geomorphology is controlled by the natural processes and anthropogenic activities. The changes in shoreline positions of Udupi coast, western India, are investigated for a period of using multi-dated satellite images and topographic maps. The study area has been divided into four littoral cells and each cell into a number of transects at uniform intervals. Further, past shoreline positions have been demarcated and future positions are estimated for 12 and The shoreline change rate has been estimated using statistical point rate, average of rates and linear cross-validated with correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error (RMSE) methods. Resultant changes from natural processes and human interventions have been inferred from the estimated values of the back-calculated errors. About of transects exhibit RMSE values, indicating better agreement between the estimated and satellite-based shoreline positions, and the transects closer to the cell boundaries exhibit uncertainties in shoreline change rate estimations. Based on the values of correlation coefficient and RMSE, the influence of natural processes and human interventions on shoreline changes have been calculated. The cells/transects dominated by natural processes record low RMSE values, whereas those influenced by human interventions show lower correlation coefficient and higher RMSE values. The present study manifests that the results of this study can be very useful in quantifying shoreline changes and in prediction of shoreline positions.\\'Abstract: \\'Fluoride contamination in the groundwater has got great attention in last few decades due to their toxicity, persistent capacity and accumulation in human bodies. There are several sources of fluoride in the environment and different pathways to enter in the drinking water resources, which is responsible for potential effect on human health. Presence of high concentration of fluoride ion in groundwater is a major issue and it makes the water unsuitable for drinking purpose. Availability of fluoride in groundwater indicates various geochemical processes and subsurface contamination of a particular area. Fluoride-bearing aquifers, geological factors, rate of weathering, ion-exchange reaction, residence time and leaching of subsurface contaminants are major responsible factors for availability of fluoride in groundwater. In India, several studies have reported that the groundwater of several states are contaminated with high fluoride. The undesirable level of fluoride in groundwater is one of the most natural groundwater quality problem, which affects large portion of arid and semiarid regions of India. Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and West Bengal are the relatively high-fluoride-contaminated states in India. Chronic ingestion of high doses of fluoride-rich water leads to fluorosis on human and animal. Over 66 million Indian populations are at risk due to excess fluoride-contaminated water. Therefore, groundwater contamination subject to undesirable level of fluoride needs urgent attention to understand the role of geochemistry, hydrogeology and climatic factors along with anthropogenic inputs in fluoride pollution.\\'Abstract: \\'Bacterial diversity of soil samples collected from different geographical regions of Himalayan mountains was studied through culturable (13 samples) and culture-independent approaches (5 samples based on abundance of diversity indices in each ecological niche). diversity index and total bacterial count ranged from to and to of soil, respectively. Based on morphology and pigmentation, 406 isolates were selected by culturing in different cultivable media at various strengths and concentrations. All the strains were subjected to amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis and the representative isolates from each cluster were chosen for 16S rRNA gene sequence-based identification. Soil habitat in Himalayan foot hills was dominated by the genera Arthrobacter, Exiguobacterium, Bacillus, Cedecea, Erwinia, and Pseudomonas. Five 16S rRNA gene libraries from the selected five samples yielded 268 clones and were grouped into 53 phylotypes covering 25 genera including the genus of Ferribacterium, Rothia, and Wautersiella, which were reported for the first time in Himalayan tracks. Principal coordinates analysis indicates that all the clone libraries were clearly separated and found to be significantly different from each other. Further, extracellular investigation of cold-active enzymes showed activity of cellulase pectinase amylase phytase protease and lipase among the isolates. Four isolates namely Exiguobacterium mexicanum (BSa14), Exiguobacterium sibiricum (BZa11), Micrococcus antarcticus (BSb10), and Bacillus simplex (BZb3) showed multiple enzyme activity for five different types of enzymes. In addition, various genera like Exiguobacterium, Erwinia, Mycetecola, Cedecea, Pantoea, and Trichococcus have also shown novel hydrolytic enzyme activity in the Himalayan foothills.\\'Abstract: \\'The impacts of climate change are of particular concern to the coastal region of tropical countries like India, which are exposed to cyclones, floods, tsunami, seawater intrusion, etc. Climate-change adaptation presupposes comprehensive assessment of vulnerability status. Studies so far relied either on remote sensing-based spatial mapping of physical vulnerability or on certain socio-economic aspects with limited scope for upscaling or replication. The current study is an attempt to develop a holistic and robust framework to assess the vulnerability of coastal India at different levels. We propose and estimate cumulative vulnerability index (CVI) as a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, at the village level, using nationally comparable and credible datasets. The exposure index (EI) was determined at the village level by decomposing the spatial multi-hazard maps, while sensitivity (SI) and adaptive capacity indices (ACI) were estimated using 23 indicators, covering social and economic aspects. The indicators were identified through the literature review, expert consultations, opinion survey, and were further validated through statistical tests. The socio-economic vulnerability index (SEVI) was constructed as a function of sensitivity and adaptive capacity for planning grassroot-level interventions and adaptation strategies. The framework was piloted in Sindhudurg, a coastal district in Maharashtra, India. It comprises 317 villages, spread across three taluks viz., Devgad, Malvan and Vengurla. The villages in Sindhudurg were ranked based on this multi-criteria approach. Based on CVI values, 92 villages (30%) in Sindhudurg were identified as highly vulnerable. We propose a decision tool for identifying villages vulnerable to changing climate, based on their level of sensitivity and adaptive capacity in a two-dimensional matrix, thus aiding in planning location-specific interventions. Here, vulnerability indicators are classified and designated as (indicators with significantly high values and intervention priority) and (indicators with low-to-moderate values) at the village level. The framework provides for aggregation or decomposition of CVI and other sub-indices, in order to plan spatial contingency plans and enable swift action for climate adaptation.\\'Abstract: \\'BMC Ecology showcases the winning entries from its second Ecology Image Competition.

Embryogenic tissue of P. roxburghii Sarg. was cryopreserved for 24 h, 10 d, and 8 wk using sorbitol and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as cryoprotectants. Results indicate that 0.2M sorbitol and 5% DMSO had the best cryoprotecting effect. The recovered tissue showed luxuriant growth on maintenance medium (II). Partial desiccation of thawed embryogenic tissue for 24 h prior to transfer to maturation medium enhanced the maturation of somatic embryos. Maturation frequency increased from 1.3 to 18.3% after 12 h desiccation treatment, and from 18.3 to 61.8% after 24 h of desiccation. However, non-desiccated embryogenic tissue produced the least number of somatic embryos (1.3%) on the maturation medium with the same abscisic acid and Gellan gum concentration. All the three embryogenic lines produced plantlets and had the same appearance and normal growth as compared to unfrozen controls.\\'Abstract: \\'In this study an attempt has been made to examine the evolutionary features of the dynamic and thermodynamic characteristics of the marine atmosphere over the South-East Arabian Sea near just two to three days prior to the onset of southwest monsoon over Kerala during 2003 and seek the linkages with the large-scale flow in the lower and middle troposphere at that time over the region. The marine meteorological data collected onboard ORV Sagarkanya as part of the experiment ARMEX-2003 for June, 2003 are used. The monsoon onset over Kerala occurred on 8 June, 2003. The observed changes in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) characteristics just two days prior to the onset are discussed. It is observed that the MABL increased in height up to 4 km on 6 June from an initial height 2.8 km on 5 June. The top of the MABL dried up (Relative Humidity RH ~ with weak and variable winds throughout the day on 6 June while the air at 850 hPa is relatively humid (RH ~ but not saturated.

Daily rainfall data has been used to understand rainfall variability. Daily ECMWF wind data for the period have been used to study the wind divergence, shear and vertical velocity profiles. Daily thermodynamic parameters from upper air soundings of Hyderabad have been examined. Aircraft data have been used to study CMCD parameters. The divergence is found between surfaces to level whereas the convergence is at which comes down to surface level during presence of low pressure systems. The divergence is observed at low mid and upper tropospheric levels. In consequence of these divergence structures, three types of cloud systems viz. shallow, congestus and deep are developed with bases just above and tops at corresponding three divergent levels. The vertical profiles of relative humidity observed by radiosonde data have been analyzed to get the frequency distribution of shallow, congestus and deep clouds. The highest frequency observed is that of congestus clouds. The thermodynamic structure shows dry surface level and warm and moist middle troposphere with tongues of dry air and multilevel inversions which have been attributed to advection of aerosol-rich dry air. The aircraft observations showed high aerosol concentrations from surface to polluted clouds with cloud droplet effective radius smaller than that required for process. The factors which are responsible for causing low rainfall over the rain-shadow area have beenAbstract: \\'Ionic composition of waterbodies in central and southern Nepal sampled in spring 1985 differed from that normally found in freshwater.

Usually, forest plantations hold fewer species than the original forest. However, structurally complex plantations support more species and individuals than simpler ones. Here we test if this phenomenon occurs in amphibian and reptilian assemblages, analyzing information regarding their richness and abundance in forestry plantations from 14 countries and 72 case studies which compare species richness and abundance in plantations and forests. Among amphibians, species richness is lower in plantations than in forests while among reptiles there is no significant difference. The abundance of reptiles increases in plantations. Three studies dealt with reptile assemblages in relation to structural complexity of plantation, which suggest that species richness and abundance is higher in complex plantations. Despite accounting for of the terrestrial vertebrates, herpetological studies account for of the research available regarding the impact of plantation upon vertebrates, information deficiency that hampers decision-making on the conservation of herpetozoans outside protected areas.\\'Abstract: \\'An efficient and reproducible procedure for the large-scale propagation of Pseudoxytenanthera stocksii is described.

Detachment of soil particles by overland flow occurs when the shear stress at the surface overcomes the gravitational forces and cohesive forces on the particles. Deposition occurs when the sediment load is greater than the transport capacity. Beasley et (Trans ASAE 1980) transport equations for laminar and turbulent flow conditions are used to calculate the transport capacity. The model is capable of handling distributed information about land use, slope, soil and roughness. The model is applied to the Catsop watershed in the Netherlands and the Harsul watershed in India. Remotely sensed data has been used to extract land use/land cover map of the Harsul watershed, and other thematic maps are generated using the GIS. The simulated results for both calibration and validation events are compared with the observed data for the watersheds and found to be reasonable. Statistical evaluation of model performance has been carried out. Further, a sensitivity analysis has also been carried out to study the effect of variation in model parameter values on computed volume of sediment, peak sediment and the time to peak sediment. Sensitivity analysis has also been carried out for grid size variation and time step variation of the Catsop watershed. The proposed model is useful in predicting the hydrographs and sedigraphs in the agricultural watersheds.\\'Abstract: \\'Spatial and temporal (pre- and post-monsoon) beach morphological changes along the Udupi district, Karnataka are investigated during 2011 and 2012. Beach profile surveys were carried out using traditional techniques at twelve selected beaches and estimated the cross sectional area and sediment volume changes. The data collected were computed and analysed using SANDS free software. Finally, based on beach profile changes, the inter-annual variabilities were quantified in-terms of cross-sectional area and sediment volumes. During the southwest monsoon period, width of the beaches in the study area reduced greatly and minimum volume of sediment is stored. The sediment volume was high during the post-monsoon season compared to the pre-monsoon season. Cross sectional area analysis reveals that most of the beaches in the study area accreted by >30%. However, the maximum reduction in areal extent at Mattu Katpadi, Gangolli, Maravanthe and Navunda beaches took place during the SW monsoon. Although cyclic in nature, large-scale erosion was found during SW monsoon but the lost sediment is regained in the post-monsoon period. Human interventions play a vital role in shoreline changes, in addition to natural processes.\\'Abstract: \\'Groundwater studies often involve using any one of geophysical, geological, geochemical, or chemical data in the assessment of its characteristics. An integrated method in using all the above had been carried out for more comprehensive and confirmative assessments along the Thandava River basin, India. The geophysical data included the recording of the vertical electrical soundings by Schlumberger array configuration in 50 stations along the basin. Thirty soil samples and rainfall data of included the geological data. Chemical characterizations for 117 groundwater water samples were carried for two seasons. This study proposes the advantages besides delineating the approach in carrying integrated rather than mere single parameter-based speculative study. This correlative and computer modeling aided study led to an in-depth along with confirmative assessments on various geological, geophysical, and chemical characteristics of the groundwater along with the pollution status. Comprehensive details of groundwater like geomorphology, potential water zones, flow pattern, soil types, geochemical evolution of ions, chemical status, and suitability can be accessed by applying this type of integrated study.\\'Abstract: \"Studies on the community structure of a mangrove forest in Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary in the Godavari estuarine system on the East Coast of India revealed altogether 15 species of mangroves represented by 8 families and 10 genera besides, 6 associate plant species and 6 of marshgrass. Description of forest structure (PCQM method) included measures of species composition, tree density, basal area and spatial distribution patterns of component vegetation at 75 GPS fixed locations. Avicennia marina, A. officinalis, Excoecaria agallocha, Aegiceras corniculatum, Sonneratia apetala, Ceriops decandra, Rhizophora apiculata and R. mucronata were the important mangrove species. Tree density varied between 47 and 1731 stems/0.1 ha and basal area 0.1 and 10.9 m2/0.01 ha. With the help of multivariate analysis (PRIMER) and based on species composition and tree density, it was possible to subdivide the sites into five groups that showed characteristic zonation patterns. For example, E. agallocha was typical of landward locations. A. marina (along with A. officinalis and A. alba) represented sites at the bed level and neap high tide level. There was a large group of sites inhabited by diverse species (14) indicative of spring high tide level conditions. Tidal elevation and ambient salinity appeared important in determining the observed zonation.\"Abstract: \\'The study aims at evaluating the various drought indices for the humid, semi-arid and arid regions of India using conventional indices, such as rainfall anomaly index, departure analysis of rainfall and other indices such as Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) and Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) that were analyzed using the DrinC software. In SPI, arid region has seven drought years, whereas humid and semi-arid regions have four. In case of RDI, the humid and semi-arid regions have 11 drought years, whereas arid regions have The difference in SPI and RDI was due to the fact that RDI considered potential evapotranspiration, and hence, correlation with plants would be better in case of RDI. Humid region showed a decreasing trend in initial value of RDI during the drought as compared to semiarid and arid regions and indicated possible climate change impact in these regions. Among all the indices, RDI was considered as an effective indicator because of implicit severity and high prediction matches with the actual drought years. SPI and RDI were found to be well correlated with respect to rainfall data and SPI values led to prediction of annual RDI. The results of our study established that this correlation could be used for developing disaster management plan well in advance to combat the drought consequences.\\'Abstract: \\'To understand the organic matter (OM) sources and trophic states, spatial and seasonal (post-monsoon and pre-monsoon) variation in sedimentary OM compositions was investigated in seven tropical estuaries of the state of Maharashtra along the central west coast of India. Based on the result of cluster analysis, estuaries were segregated into two distinct groups: Northern Maharashtra and Southern Maharashtra owing to dissimilarity in OM characteristics potentially constrained by geomorphology and catchment properties. Enrichment of Corg and major biochemical compounds (lipids, carbohydrates and proteins) in the middle zone of most estuaries highlighted towards the addition of allochthonous OM. Results of principal component analysis highlighted the similar source of OM in most of the estuaries during both seasons and their distribution largely constrained by grain size change. The benthic trophic state indicated the prevalence of eutrophic state in the middle zone of the investigated estuaries, which may be sporadic and dependent upon anthropogenic activities in the study area.\\'Abstract: \\'Human communities inhabiting remote and geomorphically fragile high-altitude regions are particularly vulnerable to climate change-related glacial hazards and hydrometeorological extremes. This study presents a strategy for enhancing adaptation and resilience of communities living immediately downstream of two potentially hazardous glacial lakes in the Upper Chenab Basin of the Western Himalaya in India. It uses an interdisciplinary investigative framework, involving ground surveys, participatory mapping, comparison of local perceptions of environmental change and hazards with scientific data, identification of assets and livelihood resources at risk, assessment of existing community-level adaptive capacity and resilience and a brief review of governance issues. In addition to recommending specific actions for securing lives and livelihoods in the study area, the study demonstrates the crucial role of regional ground-level, community-centric assessments in evolving an integrated approach to disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation for high-altitude environments, particularly in the developing world.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'The present study was conducted during July 2013 (early phase of monsoon or EM) and September 2013 (later phase of monsoon or LM) to ascertain the intra-monsoonal variation on zooplankton, by selecting 15 study stations in the river Saptamukhi, one of the main estuaries in the Sundarbans Estuarine System (SES). In 2013, SES experienced an unusually high monsoonal rainfall also exacerbated by cloud burst event at Himalayan region (upper stretches of SES) which tremendously increased the river runoff. The present work was aimed to decipher the effect of this unusual precipitation during the monsoon season on zooplankton assemblages along with different hydrological parameters. The abundance of zooplankton was recorded as lower during EM compared to LM. Altogether, 56 zooplankton taxa were identified with copepods forming the predominant population. Thirty-three copepod species were reported with 25 calanoid species forming the bulk of the biomass followed by 5 and 3 species of cyclopoids and harpacticoid, respectively. A combination of multivariate cluster analysis, biotic indices, and canonical correspondence analysis revealed noticeable alterations in the zooplankton community structure across the spatio-temporal scale. Furthermore, significant intra-monsoonal changes in zooplankton population correlated with several hydrological parameters were clearly noticed. Paracalanus parvus, Bestiolina similis and Oithona similis were observed to be the most dominant copepod species in both sampling periods. The result of the present study provides new insight on estuarine zooplankton community after unusual rainfall during monsoon season, and provides further evidence to support the conservation and management of the SES ecosystem.\\'Abstract: \\'Based on literature sources and the field surveys in the past (particularly in 2008 and 2009), a checklist of cultivated plants of Yunnan (Southwest China) was compiled. It contains 1,701 taxa belonging to 1,562 different species, 837 genera and 190 families. The alphabetically ordered articles for the taxa contain the botanical name, the plant family, Chinese name and folk names, details of plant uses, information about the regional distribution, places of origin, and references to relevant, mostly Yunnan literature sources. The checklist provides a useful tool for the exploration of plant genetic resources and may be equally interesting for agronomists, horticulturists, botanists, ethnobotanists and others who are interested in cultivated plants.\\'Abstract: \\'This paper presents the first comprehensive report of the organochlorine pesticide residues (OCs) such as hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its six metabolites (DDTs), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in core sediments particle size) from the Indian Sunderban wetland. The pooled mean values of the mass fraction of HCB, and in the sediments were and dry weight, respectively. The vertical distribution of pesticides reveals an erratic pattern. The concentration of four isomers of HCHs reveals a heterogenic distribution where (lindane) and shared the dominant part. The mass fraction of HCB did not show any sharp spatial variation. The prevailing sequence of DDT metabolites indicates an active degradation of the parent compound in the sediments and/or inputs of already degraded to the region. Peak concentrations of HCH isomers and DDT metabolites have the potential to induce ecotoxicological impact as per the sediment quality guidelines.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'In this paper, an attempt has been made to delineate groundwater potential zones in Hingoli district, Maharashtra, India. Remote sensing and traditional data were collected from different sources and analysed in GIS software to prepare thematic maps of different geo-environmental factors such as lithology, drainage, lineaments, slope etc. as these factors having an impact on groundwater availability of an area, directly or indirectly. All these factors have been integrated into GIS software and multi influence factor method was applied to delineate groundwater potential zones. The result has shown about 50% area is having the good potentiality of groundwater, whereas about 6% region falls under very low potential area. The Central part of the study area is having very low groundwater potential, mainly due to the steep slope and rocky outcrop. The southern part of the Hingoli district has shown good groundwater potential, because of the gentle slope which influences water to infiltrate. All the major towns and villages are located in good groundwater prospect areas. Therefore, these locations do not experience extreme drought conditions. The present work is valuable for future planning and management of groundwater resource in Hingoli district.\\'Abstract: \\'Many hydrological approaches have been developed for humid areas; however, we still have many challenges regarding flash floods simulation in arid regions. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to develop a physically based hydrological model for flash floods simulation, to understand the hydrological processes, and to overcome the water relating problems, as water scarcity, data deficiency. In this study, Hydrological River Basin Environmental Assessment Model incorporating wadi system (Hydro-BEAM-WaS) integrated with both Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing data is proposed. To overcome the lack of observational data, Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) data has been compared with the Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC) data. We found that the GSMaP has an overestimated or underestimated systematic seasonal bias. Wadi El-Khoud in Oman was chosen for model calibration, while the River Nile basin in Egypt was chosen for flash flood simulations. The simulation has been successfully carried out where it exhibits a reasonable fit between both the simulated and observed results, in spite of the deficiency of high quality observations. This approach can be used to evaluate and simulate the wadi runoff behaviors, such as discontinuous surface flow. It also can help in estimating the initial and transmission losses. Flash flood water has been assessed and evaluated as new water resources, which would be properly utilized to overcome the problem of water shortage in such regions. The proposed model has been proven to provide reliable simulations of flash floods referring to ungauged wadi systems.\\'Abstract: \\'Over the last ten years we have seen great efforts focused on revising amphibian systematics. Phylogenetic reconstructions derived from DNA sequence data have played a central role in these revisionary studies but have typically under-sampled the diverse frog family Microhylidae.

Specifically, we placed an emphasis on assessing relationships among New World genera and those taxa with uncertain phylogenetic affinities (i.e., incertae sedis).\\'Abstract: \\'Sediments collected from the River Buriganga were analyzed by using ICP-MS for spatial (site-to-site) and seasonal variations of a large number of elements, as many as 48. Out of these elements, 15 elements were given more attention because of their detrimental effects on human health and aquatic lives. These 15 elements are V, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Mo, Cd, Ba, Hg, Pb, Bi and U, and their mean concentrations were and in monsoon, respectively; the mean concentrations in winter were and respectively. These results indicate that concentrations of the studied elements were almost the same in both the seasons. However, the concentrations were slightly higher in winter than those in monsoon with respect to spatial variation. The higher concentrations of Cr in both the seasons were due to direct discharge of tanning effluents for a long time. Values of contamination factor (Cf), degree of contamination (Cd), pollution load index and ecological risk potential (RI) factors for the selected toxic elements, i.e., Cr, Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cd, As, Hg in the surface sediments, indicated that the contamination status in the studied area was low. The low contamination level may be due to steps taken by the authorities to prevent direct discharge of industrial effluents in the River Buriganga in the recent years.\\'broadleaved species\\'Abstract: \\'This study compared litter production, litter decomposition and nutrient return in pure and mixed species plantations. Dry weight and N, P, K, Ca, Mg quantities in the litterfall were measured in one pure Cunninghamia lanceolata plantation (PC) and two mixed-species plantations of C. lanceolata with Alnus cremastogyne (MCA) and Kalopanax septemlobus (MCK) in subtropical China. Covering 6 years of observations, mean annual litter production of MCA and MCK was significantly higher than that of PC Broadleaved trees contributed 42% of the total litter production in MCA and 31% in MCK. Introduction of broadleaved tree species had no significant effect on litterfall pattern. Total litterfall was greatest in the dry season from November to March. Nutrient returns to the forest floor through leaf litter were significantly higher in both MCA and MCK than in PC The amounts of N, K, and Mg returned to the forest floor through leaf litter were highest in the MCA, and P and Ca returns were highest in the MCK. Percent contribution of broadleaf litter to total nutrient returns ranged from 41.7% to 86.9% in MCA and from 49.3% to 74.8% in MCK. The decomposition rate of individual leaf litter increased in the order: C. cremastogyne. Litter mixing had a positive effect on decomposition rate of the more recalcitrant litter and promoted nutrient return. Relative to mass loss of A. cremastogyne decomposing alone, higher mass loss of the mixture of C. lanceolata and A. cremastogyne was observed after 330 days of decomposition. These results indicate that mixed plantations of different tree species have advantages over monospecific plantations with regards to nutrient fluxes and these advantages have relevance to restoration of degraded sites.\\'Abstract: Abstract not availableAbstract: \\'With growing population and urbanization, there is an increasing exploitation of natural resources, and this often results to environmental pollution. In this review, the levels of heavy metal in lentic compartments (water, sediment, fishes, and aquatic plants) over the past two decades have been summarized to evaluate the current pollution status of this ecosystem. In all the compartments, the heavy metals dominated are zinc followed by iron. The major reason could be area mineralogy and lithogenic sources. Enormous quantity of metals like iron in estuarine sediment is a very natural incident due to the permanently reducing condition of organic substances. Contamination of cadmium, lead, and chromium was closely associated with anthropogenic origin. In addition, surrounding land use and atmospheric deposition could have been responsible for substantial pollution. The accumulation of heavy metals in fishes and aquatic plants is the result of time-dependent deposition in lentic ecosystems. Moreover, various potential risk assessment methods for heavy metals were discussed. This review concludes that natural phenomena dominate the accumulation of essential heavy metals in lentic ecosystems compared to anthropogenic sources. Amongst other recent reviews on heavy metals from other parts of the world, the present review is executed in such a way that it explains the presence of heavy metals not only in water environment, but also in the whole of the lentic system comprising sediment, fishes, and aquatic plants.\\'tissues\\'Abstract: \\'Deep RNA-Seq profiling, a revolutionary method used for quantifying transcriptional levels, often includes non-specific transcripts from other co-existing organisms in spite of stringent protocols. Using the recently published walnut genome sequence as a filter, we present a broad analysis of the RNA-Seq derived transcriptome profiles obtained from twenty different tissues to extract the biodiversity and possible interactions in the walnut ecosystem in California. Since the residual nature of the transcripts being analyzed does not provide sufficient information to identify the exact strain, inferences made are constrained to the genus level. The presence of the pathogenic oomycete Phytophthora was detected in the root through the presence of a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Cryptococcus, the causal agent of cryptococcosis, was found in the catkins and vegetative buds, corroborating previous work indicating that the plant surface supported the sexual cycle of this human pathogen. The RNA-Seq profile revealed several species of the endophytic nitrogen fixing Actinobacteria. Another bacterial species implicated in aerobic biodegradation of methyl tert-butyl ether (Methylibium petroleiphilum) is also found in the root. RNA encoding proteins from the pea aphid were found in the leaves and vegetative buds, while a serine protease from mosquito with significant homology to a female reproductive tract protease from Drosophila mojavensis in the vegetative bud suggests egg-laying activities. The comprehensive analysis of RNA-seq data present also unraveled detailed, tissue-specific information of ~400 transcripts encoded by the largest family of resistance (R) genes (NBS-LRR), which possibly rationalizes the resistance of the specific walnut plant to the pathogens detected. Thus, we elucidate the biodiversity and possible interactions in several walnut (Juglans regia) tissues in California using deep RNA-Seq profiling.\\'Abstract: \\'In this study, we investigated the genetic diversity and relationships in C. olitorius by analysing populations representing different distribution areas, and developed a hypothesis on the origin and spread of the species in the pantropics. We employed amplified fragment lengths polymorphism (AFLP) and morphometric analyses in a total of 101 C. olitorius accessions. Results of both data sets are mostly congruent. The molecular analysis indicated generally low genetic diversity within populations and the gene diversity (He) ranged from 0.0457 to 0.0955 with a mean of 0.0763. Qualitative traits, especially related to leaf morphology, branching habit and stipule color were the taxonomically most informative characters. The highest morphological variability occurred within African accessions, indicating that this species originally evolved in Africa. In both analyses, the Asian materials were nested within African populations, especially with those from North and East Africa. This indicates an African origin of the species and we hypothesise that dispersal occurred via the trade routes instead of natural migration along the coasts from western Africa to the Indian subcontinent. Both analyses revealed materials from Ethiopia to be quite distinct. The highest number of private bands percent polymorphism (29.29%), and gene diversity (0.0955) were also detected in wild accessions collected from Ethiopia, suggesting a long-term spatial isolation of C. olitorius populations in the country. Germplasm samples from this region could therefore be a useful source of genetic variation in jute breeding programs.\\'Abstract: \\'Sagar Lake is situated in the middle of the Sagar City in the Vindhyan terrain of Bundelkhand region of India at an elevation of above mean sea level. The lake surface area and volume are and at full tank level. Sedimentation rates and pattern in the lake have been estimated using 137Cs and 210Pb radiometric dating techniques. The lake has been subdivided into eight zones on the basis of sedimentation rate and under water topography. The sedimentation rate in the lake has been found to vary between 0.30 and depending upon the location. The estimated mean sedimentation rate is The observed sedimentation pattern reveals that the sedimentation rate decreases from near shore to far shore and minimum at the deepest part of the lake. The estimated useful life of the lake based on Post-1964 average sedimentation rate is aroundAbstract: \\'Genetic variability and population structure of Sapindus trifoliatus L. (Sapindaceae), collected from Gujarat, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh states were estimated using three DNA fingerprinting methods viz., random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), directed amplification of minisatellite DNA (DAMD) and inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR). The cumulative data analysis carried out for all three markers showed polymorphism. The intra-population genetic diversity analysis revealed the highest values of genetic diversity (0.16), Shannon information index (0.24) and polymorphic loci among Bhavnagar (BH) population, whereas lowest values were found in Junagarh (JU) population. The maximum inter-population average genetic distance (0.20) was between Allahabad (AL) and JU populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed highest percentage of variation among individuals of populations followed by among populations and among regions. Principal coordinate analysis and UPGMA dendrogram revealed that genetic diversity was in congruence with the geographical diversity. The data strongly suggest that low genetic flow, geographic isolation and to some extent genetic drift are the major factors responsible for high genetic differentiation. Preservation of genetic diversity of S. trifoliatus is important, both to promote adaptability of the populations to changing environment as well as to preserve a large gene pool for future genetic improvement. The present study using RAPD, DAMD and ISSR profiles of S. trifoliatus provide the means of rapid characterization of accessions within the populations, and thus enable the selection of appropriate accessions for further utilization in conservation and prospection programs of this important plant genetic resource.\\'Abstract: \\'The systematic screening of plant species with the purpose of discovering new bioactive compounds is prerequisite for any bioprospecting study.

The current study proposes a framework for developing optimal irrigation schedules for rice crop (Oryza sativa) under water deficit conditions. The framework utilizes a rice crop growth simulation model to identify the critical periods of growth that are highly sensitive to the reduction in final crop yield, and a genetic algorithm based optimizer develops the optimal water allocations during the crop growing period. The model ORYZA2000, which is employed as the crop growth simulation model, is calibrated and validated using field experimental data prior to incorporating in the proposed framework. The proposed framework was applied to a real world case study of a command area in southern India, and it was found that significant improvement in total yield can be achieved by the model compared to other water saving irrigation methods. The results of the study were highly encouraging and suggest that by employing a calibrated crop growth model combined with an optimization algorithm can lead to achieve maximum water use efficiency.\\'Abstract: \\'Present studies on the community characteristics of earthworms revealed the occurrence of 11 species of earthworms in the pineapple (Ananus comosus) and 14 species in the mixed fruit plantations of west Tripura (India). While 9 species of earthworms namely Drawida assamensis, Drawida papillifer papillifer, Drawida nepalensis, Kanchuria sp., Metaphire houlleti, Eutyphoeus gigas, Eutyphoeus scutarius, Eutyphoeus comillahnus and Pontoscolex corethrurus are of common occurrence to both the pineapple and the mixed fruit plantations, two and five earthworm species namely Kanchuria sumerianus, Eutyphoeus sp. and Metaphire posthuma, Perionyx excavatus, Lampito mauritii, Amynthus alexandri, Eutyphoeus gammiei are restricted to the pineapple and the mixed fruit plantations respectively. Earthworms were found mostly within depth of soils having temperature moisture water holding capacity and organic matter content Mean earthworm densities was significantly higher and biomass significantly lower in the pineapple plantation than the mixed fruit plantation (density biomass High density value of earthworms in pineapple plantation is linked with dominance of D. assamensis and high biomass value in mixed fruit plantation was due to the higher relative abundance of larger species like E. gigas, E. scutarius, E. comillahnus and E. gammiei. Compared to the mixed fruit plantation, significantly higher index of dominance, lower index of diversity, species richness index and species evenness were recorded in the pineapple plantation.\\'Nadu (India)\\'Abstract: \\'Uranium is a radioactive element normally present in hexavalent form as U(VI) in solution and elevated levels in drinking water cause health hazards. Representative groundwater samples were collected from different litho-units in this region and were analyzed for total U and major and minor ions. Results indicate that the highest U concentration was found in granitic terrains of this region and about of the samples exceed the permissible limit for drinking water. Among different species of U in aqueous media, carbonate complexes [UO2(CO3) 2 ] are found to be dominant. Groundwater with higher U has higher pCO2 values, indicating weathering by bicarbonate ions resulting in preferential mobilization of U in groundwater. The major minerals uraninite and coffinite were found to be supersaturated and are likely to control the distribution of U in the study area. Nature of U in groundwater, the effects of lithology on hydrochemistry and factors controlling its distribution in hard rock aquifers of Madurai district are highlighted in this paper.\\'Abstract: \\'Phthalate esters are well known for their environmental contamination and toxicological effects as In this study, environmental levels of phthalate esters and ecotoxicological risk assessments were performed in one of the major rivers in India, the Kaveri. Water and sediment samples were collected during representing the major stretch of the river and extracted by solid-phase and ultrasonic methods, respectively, and analyzed for six major phthalates by using a gas spectrometer. The analytical recovery for phthalates in water and sediment ranged from 79 to Results indicated that diethyl phthalate (DEP) and dimethyl phthalate were found in every sample, whereas butylbenzyl phthalate and diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) were detected in of the water samples. Likewise, in sediment samples, DEP was found most often The total phthalates in water samples ranged from 313 to whereas in sediments it was 2 to dw (dry weight) with DEHP having the highest concentration. Human health risk assessment based on drinking water consumption showed no potential risk for phthalates and also DEHP levels were safe with respect to USEPA guideline Further, DEHP and di-n-octyl phthalate levels in water were expected to pose little threat to sensitive organisms in the riverine ecosystem as per ECOSAR chronic values. In case of sediment, the DEHP concentration was well above the USEPA sediment guideline value. To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the levels and ecotoxicological risks of phthalates in Kaveri River, India.\\'Abstract: \\'Certain wood quality parameters of about 9-year-old Melia dubia Cav. trees grown in a seedling seed orchard at Yeshwanthpura Research Station of Kolar research range, Karnataka India were studied. Trees were categorized into three classes depending upon their girth at the breast medium and big Different anatomical (gross structure), physical and mechanical properties of the wood were evaluated using standard testing procedures and Indian Standards. The results of this study showed that there was no significant difference in the heartwood percentage and specific gravity among three girth classes. High shrinkage values from green to oven-dry condition in all the classes indicate that the timber is dimensionally unstable compared to teak. The static bending strength at LP, MOR and MOE, compression strength parallel to grain, compressive strength perpendicular to grain at limit of proportionality and surface hardness (side and end) were evaluated and compared among all the three girth classes. The data on mechanical properties were statistically analysed using ANOVA between three girth classes. The results on wood quality parameters may be utilized in selection of suitable genotypes for raising large scale plantations.\\'of Seawater\\'Abstract: \\'This article focuses on the temporal and spatial distribution of three organophosphorous methyl parathion, and the sedimentary environment of a backwater ecosystem, Kuttanad backwaters, situated in Kerala, India. Based on salinity distribution, geographic characteristics, and human activities prevailing in the area, the study area was divided into three zones: zone 1 with riverine characteristics, zone 2 with freshwater characteristics during and after the monsoon season and estuarine characteristics during the premonsoon season, and zone 3 with estuarine characteristics. The organophosphorus pesticides in the study area showed the order of enrichment as chlorpyrifos >malathion >methyl parathion. While studying the variations in pesticide concentrations seasonally, higher concentrations were observed during the premonsoon monsoon season, with the concentrations being lower than the detectable level. Sediment characteristics, such as pH, texture, organic carbon, moisture content, etc., had reflective effect on the degradation rates of pesticides. The runoff water from the paddy fields made a larger contribution of pesticide pollution to the study area.\\'Abstract: \\'Sulfide distribution is a key controller of vegetation zonation in coastal ecosystems, but data are limited regarding its impact on the spatial distribution of important N cycling processes. We assessed vegetation distribution and density and, mineral N pool sizes, composition and transformations in a sulfidic coastal marsh in relation to distance from sulfur springs. We observed strong relationships between vegetation attributes (species and density) and mineral N status with greater total inorganic N, and denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) in sediment samples from areas populated by Crithmum maritimum (mid-way between S springs and sea shore) than in sediments from areas colonized by either Agropyron repens (closest to the S springs) or mangrove (Rhizophora mangleL., farthest from the springs). Our data also suggest close links between N cycling and reduction. The latter resulted in net release of NH4+ ranging from in the low density C. maritimum to in the high-density A. repens, during a 3-day incubation. We also tested for microbial adaptation to long-term high sulfide exposure by measuring DEA using the C2H2 block method (which has been found to be strongly affected by the presence of sulfide) and amendment of marsh sediment samples with NaMoO4 to suppress reduced S production. In sediments extracted from sites near the sulfur springs (A. repens and C. maritimum), the C2H2 blockage assay yielded similar results without and with NaMoO4 addition. However, in samples from a mangrove located further downstream from the springs, DEA was substantially lower (2.3 vs. sediment when production of reduced S was not inhibited by NaMoO4. These results suggest that denitrifying microbes in the high sulfide areas may have adapted to the presence of sulfide, allowing for high rates of N and S cycling to occur simultaneously in these marshes.\\'Abstract: \\'The response of decomposition of litter for the dominant tree species in disturbed (pine), rehabilitated (pine and broadleaf mixed) and mature (monsoon evergreen broadleaf) forests in subtropical China to simulated N deposition was studied to address the following hypothesis: (1) litter decomposition is faster in mature forest (high soil N availability) than in rehabilitated/disturbed forests (low soil N availability); (2) litter decomposition is stimulated by N addition in rehabilitated and disturbed forests due to their low soil N availability; (3) N addition has little effect on litter decomposition in mature forest due to its high soil N availability. The litterbag method (a total of 2880 litterbags) and N treatments: Control-no N addition, Low-N: Medium-N: and High-N: were employed to evaluate decomposition. Results indicated that mature forest, which has likely been N saturated due to both long-term high N deposition in the region and the age of the ecosystem, had the highest litter decomposition rate, and exhibited no significant positive and even some negative response to nitrogen additions. However, both disturbed and rehabilitated forests, which are still N limited due to previous land use history, exhibited slower litter decomposition rates with significant positive effects from nitrogen additions. These results suggest that litter decomposition and its responses to N addition in subtropical forests of China vary depending on the nitrogen status of the ecosystem.\\'Abstract: \\'Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus has a long-standing history of bacterial-plant interrelationship as a symbiotic endophyte capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen. In low nitrogen fertilized sugarcane fields it plays a significant role and its occurrence was realised in most of the sugarcane growing countries. In this mini review, the association of G. diazotrophicus with sugarcane, other crop plants and with various hosts is discussed. The factors affecting survival in the rhizosphere and the putative soil mode of transmission are emphasized. In addition, other N2-fixing Acetobacteraceae members, including Gluconacetobacter azotocaptans, Gluconacetobacter johannae and Swaminathania salitolerans, occurring in coffee, corn and rice plants are also covered. Lastly, the plant-growth-promoting traits identified in this group of bacteria, including N2 fixation, phytohormone synthesis, P and Zn solubilization and biocontrol, are analysed.\\'Abstract: \\' Calamus guruba Buch.-Ham., a perennial, dioecious rattan species of the family Arecaceae has recently emerged as an important source of tribal economy owing to its high-quality flexible canes for furniture manufacturing and cottage industries. The dioecious nature together with disproportionate distribution of male and female sex organs has been the major constraint in the development of an effective breeding programme for the plant. Early identification of the male and female genotypes at the seedling stage is a pre-requisite to ensure genetic improvement of C. guruba. In the present study, we used 30 inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers to develop a sequence-tagged site (STS) linked to male sex in C. guruba. Molecular analysis of bulked DNA pooled from male and female genotypes resulted in the isolation of a putative male-specific marker CgMSM. Partial sequencing of CgMSM resulted in an STS marker CgMY1 which could successfully amplify a 597-bp fragment in male but not in the female plants. DNA gel blot analysis confirmed it as a single-copy locus in the male genome of C. guruba. Further validation of CgMY1 in the natural population of C. guruba resulted in precise detection of 9 males and 6 females from 15 individuals with unknown sex. Therefore, the STS marker CgMY1 could be used as a proficient tool for early sex differentiation and form the basis of a sustainable breeding programme for genetic improvement of C. guruba.\\'Abstract: \\'This study addresses the issues of spatial distribution, dispersal, and genetic heterogeneity in social groups of the cellular slime molds (CSMs). The CSMs are soil amoebae with an unusual life cycle that consists of alternating solitary and social phases. Because the social phase involves division of labor with what appears to be an extreme form of the CSMs raise interesting evolutionary questions regarding the origin and maintenance of sociality. Knowledge of the genetic structure of social groups in the wild is necessary for answering these questions. We confirm that CSMs are widespread in undisturbed forest soil from South India. They are dispersed over long distances via the dung of a variety of large mammals. Consistent with this mode of dispersal, most social groups in the two species examined for detailed study, Dictyostelium giganteum and Dictyostelium purpureum, are multi-clonal.\\'Abstract: \\'The hilly terrains of Himalaya are among the most vulnerable of the regions of India due to natural hazards. Different kinds of landslides occur frequently in the tectonically and geodynamically active region of Himalaya. Transportation, public networks, and all kinds of socioeconomic activities that occur in the high hills of the Lesser Himalaya are entirely dependent upon the local road and highway network in this region. However, the stability of the slopes that have been cut to construct and/or widen roads and highways is a major concern in hilly regions. Unplanned excavations performed by blasting have resulted in these cut slopes that are on the verge of instability. Such slopes become vulnerable under the influence of factors such as heavy rainfall, seismic activity, dynamic loading, and/or various kinds of human intervention. Any kind of slope failure can lead to disruption of traffic, losses of property and lives, injuries, as well as environmental degradation. In the present study, a slope stability analysis was performed of road-cut slopes along about of NH-109 from Rudraprayag to Agastmuni in the state of Uttarakhand in India. Based on field observations and variations in geological and geotechnical conditions, five locations were chosen for detailed study, including a laboratory study and numerical analysis. The two-dimensional conventional limit equilibrium method and a numerical technique based on the finite element method were used to analyze the cut slopes. This comparative analysis of slope stability provided a deeper understanding of this issue. The results of the analyses performed using both methods aided in identifying potentially vulnerable slopes and enabled us to compare the two methods.\\'Abstract: \\'The genus Adiantum L. are medicinal ferns with around 200 species and distributed in temperate and tropical regions.

Seven frogs from conventional but none from the organic farms revealed deformities. Levels of total Organochlorines (OCs) and Synthetic Pyrethroid, Fenvalerate-II in deformed F. limnocharis and H. crassus were significantly greater than in healthy frogs. Among OCs in healthy frogs, traces of (gamma)-HCH (hexachlorocyclohexane) were found only in F. limnocharis from organic farm. Among Organophosphates, Phorate and Quinalphos were present in traces in deformed F. limnocharis, while Parathion ethyl was detected in deformed H. crassus. The data indicate that the high level of pesticides may have contributed to the deformity of frogs. Therefore, an elaborative study will be essential to conserve amphibians in India.\\'Abstract: \\'The present study was undertaken to examine the possible genotoxicity of ambient particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) in Pune city. In both size fractions of PM, Fe was found to be the dominant metal by concentration, contributing 22% and 30% to the total mass of metals in PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. The speciation of soluble Fe in PM10 and PM2.5 was investigated. The average fraction of Fe3+ and Fe2+ concentrations in PM2.5 was 80.6% and 19.3%, respectively, while in PM2.5 this fraction was 71.1% and 29.9%, respectively. The dominance of Fe(III) state in both PM fractions facilitates the generation of hydroxyl radicals which can damage deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA), as was evident from the gel electrophoresis study. The DNA damage by was supported through the in silico density functional theory (DFT) method. DFT results showed that C8 site of guanine (G)/adenine (A) and C6 site of thymine (T)/cytosine (C) would be energetically more favorable for the attack of hydroxyl radicals, when compared with the C4 and C5 sites. The non-standard base pairing models of oxidative products of G, A, T and C yield lower-energy conformations than canonical dA:dT and dG:dC base pairing. This study may pave the way to understand the structural consequences of base-mediated oxidative lesions in DNA and its role in human diseases.\\'Abstract: \\'Amba Estuary, which receives effluent from several industries including a petrochemical complex, opens to the southern limits of the Mumbai Harbor. The study was conducted to find out the level of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPHs) in water and their bioconcentration in ten commercially important fishes from Amba Estuary during different months. In water high concentration of TPHs was obtained during December (middle of estuary) and minimum value was observed in September (lower estuarine). The maximum concentration of TPHs was found to be in Trichiurus savala during December and minimum in Boleophthalmus sp during May. Irrespective of the monthly variations, TPHs accumulation in all the species was considerably lower than hazardous levels. Although there was no statistical significance between TPHs and total length/weight, the T. savala recording maximum concentration during all months and it can be used as indicator of hydrocarbon pollution in this region.\\'Abstract: \\'In countries like India where multiple risks interact with socio-economic differences to create and sustain vulnerability, assessing the vulnerability of people, places, and systems to climate change is a critical tool to prioritise adaptation. In India, several vulnerability assessment tools have been designed spanning multiple disciplines, by multiple actors, and at multiple scales. However, their conceptual, methodological, and disciplinary underpinnings, and resulting implications on who is identified as vulnerable, have not been interrogated. Addressing this gap, we systematically review peer-reviewed publications and grey literature to characterise how vulnerability to climate change is assessed in India. We frame our enquiry against four questions: (1) How is vulnerability conceptualised (vulnerability of whom/what, vulnerability to what), (2) who assesses vulnerability, (3) how is vulnerability assessed (methodology, scale), and (4) what are the implications of methodology on outcomes of the assessment. Our findings emphasise that methods to assess vulnerability to climate change are embedded in the disciplinary traditions, methodological approaches, and often-unstated motivations of those designing the assessment. Further, while most assessments acknowledge the importance of scalar and temporal aspects of vulnerability, we find few examples of it being integrated in methodology. Such methodological myopia potentially overlooks how social differentiation, ecological shifts, and institutional dynamics construct and perpetuate vulnerability. Finally, we synthesise the strengths and weaknesses of current vulnerability assessment methods in India and identify a predominance of research in rural landscapes with a relatively lower coverage in urban and peri-urban settlements, which are key interfaces of transitions.\\'Abstract: \"The relationship between EUF extractable nutrients and conventional soil test extractable nutrients in the acid soils of Southern India on one hand and that between EUF values and tea productivity on the other are described.

Due to presence of anti-physiological and anti-nutritional factors, coffee pulp is not considered as adequate substrate for bioconversion process by coffee farmers. Recent stringent measures by Pollution Control authorities, made it mandatory to treat all the solid and liquid waste emanating from the coffee farms. A study was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of an exotic (Eudrilus eugeniae) and a native earthworm (Perionyx ceylanesis) from coffee farm for decomposition of coffee pulp into valuable vermicompost. Exotic earthworms were found to degrade the coffee pulp faster as compared to the native worms and the vermicomposting efficiency (77.9%) and vermicompost yield were found to significantly higher with native worms. The multiplication rate of earthworms (280%) and worm yield recorded significantly higher with the exotic earthworms. The percentage of nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, calcium and magnesium in vermicompost was found to increase while C:N ratio, pH and total organic carbon declined as a function of the vermicomposting. The plant nutrients, nitrogen (80.6%), phosphorus (292%) and potassium (550%) content found to increase significantly in the vermicompost produced using native earthworms as compared to the initial values, while the calcium (85.7%) and magnesium (210%) content found to increase significantly in compost produced utilizing exotic worms. Vermicompost and vermicasts from native earthworms recorded significantly higher functional microbial population as compared to the exotic worms. The study reveals that coffee pulp can be very well used as substrate for vermicomposting using exotic (Eudrilus eugeniae) and native earthworm (Perionyx ceylanesis).\\'Abstract: of soil-dwelling mites were monitored in monoculture plots of four agroforestry tree species, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Dactyladenia barteri and Treculia africana, and compared to those in grass and secondary forest plots in the dry season (December 1993 to January 1994) and in the wet season (April to June 1994) in southwest Nigeria. Mite populations were very low in all plots during the dry season compared to those during the wet season The highest mite population was observed in Gliricidia plots for the dry season and Leucaena plots for the wet season. Mite genera that were dominant in all the experimental plots were Annectacarus, Haplozetes, Machadobelba, Scheloribates and members of the Galumnidae, Dermanyssidae and Parasitidae. The community structure of mites was similar in the soil for Treculia and Gliricidia plots and for Leucaena and Dactyladenia plots. There were more taxonomic groups of mites under Leucaena than in the other agroforestry plots. Based on the density, diversity and complexity of the mite communities, Leucaena was considered to be better than other agroforestry species in encouraging the growth of mite populations.\\'Abstract: \"A water resource accounting study has been carried out for a limestonemining area located in Thondamuthur block of Coimbatore district under Tamilnadu state in India. The major source of surface water in the region is south-west and north-west monsoons during July-August and October-November, respectively. During the winter season, groundwater levels range from 13 to 25 m below the surface whereas during the summer season it varies from 20 to 30 m. The thickness of the weathered zone ranges from 10 to 40 m and the depth to bedrock ranges from 50 to 55 m. The groundwater is generally potable. The average annual rainfall during the twelve-year period is 590 mm. Out of the total rainfall, around 11% is lost as surface runoff, 10% is lost through evaporation and transpiration, 30% is utilized for consumptive used, 16% is absorbed as subsoil loss and remaining only 33% is stored as groundwater recharge. Again out of total groundwater recharge only 85% is utilizable groundwater. The annual utilizable groundwater resource available in the area is 79.220 million cubic metre (MCM). Whereas, total groundwater demand for the region is 68.922 MCM, and breakup of industrial, domestic and agricultural demands are 0.020, 5.956 and 62.946 MCM, respectively. Therefore, at present the stage of groundwater development or utilization for the area is around 87%, and falls under `Dark\\' category. The `Dark\\' category indicates that the utilization of groundwater is more than 85% of available groundwaterresource. This situation has to be controlled by immediate initiation ofsuitable measures for groundwater recharge. The identified recharge zonesin the block along with the recommended recharging methodology are summarized in this paper. The paper includes a comprehensive site description, status of the water resource and demand, identification of recharge zones and recharging techniques, and recommends a water supply augmentation strategy for enhancement of water resources in the region.\"Abstract: \\'The paper shows that isoresistivity contours for different depths, drawn from interpreted resistivity values, can indicate the location of underground lineaments. A comparison of the surface lineament map with the maps of isoresistivity contours for different depths shows that many of the underground lineaments recognised through the resistivity studies have surface expressions as lineaments. The underground lineaments allow large-scale migration of groundwater and can be used as sites for the artificial recharging of aquifers. It is concluded that the maps prepared from interpreted resistivity values derived by curve matching can give a better picture of the underground structures than the conventional maps prepared from apparent resistivity values.\\'Abstract: \\'Disturbance, man-made or natural, is an innate process of any landscape. Disturbance gradient analysis provides insight into the disturbance status of forest which is useful for forest management. In the present study new landscape metrics are introduced through FRAGSTATS 3.3 software for analyzing both anthropogenic and natural disturbance pattern of Daltonganj south forest division of Jharkhand state. Various landscape indices were used for natural disturbance analysis. Anthropogenic disturbance was measured as function of the proximity of landscape to roads and settlements. It was observed that the forests of the study area are experiencing varied degrees of disturbances. The software in combination with ARC VIEW Spatial Analyst was found to be a cost effective and user friendly landscape analysis tool.\\'Abstract: \\'Biodiversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization and spore population was investigated in different agroforestry trees and crop species collected from different locations of Dinajpur district of Bangladesh. Roots and rhizosphere soils of Albizia procera Benth., Capsicum frutescens L, Curcuma domestica Vahl., Dalbergia sissoo Roxb. and Swietenia macrophylla King. from Dashmail; C. domestica, D. sissoo, Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnn., Gmelina arborea (Roxb) DC and Oryza sativa L. from Kantaji and C. domestica, D. sissoo, Litchi chinensis Sonn. and O. sativa from Ramsagar were collected.

Remote Sensing (RS) refers to the science of identification of earth surface features and estimation of their geo-biophysical properties using electromagnetic radiation as a medium of interaction. Spectral, spatial, temporal and polarization signatures are major characteristics of the sensor/target, which facilitate target discrimination. Earth surface data as seen by the sensors in different wavelengths (reflected, scattered and/or emitted) is radiometrically and geometrically corrected before extraction of spectral information [2, 3]. Remote Sensing data, with its ability for a synoptic view, repetitive coverage with calibrated sensors to detect changes, observations at different resolutions, provides a better alternative for natural resources management as compared to traditional methods [4,Abstract: \\'Open-cast mining generates sediment in river systems at globally significant scales. One of the challenges in attributing measured sediment loads to upstream mining activities is establishing the source of sediments that are a mixture of natural and mining-based materials. The environmental magnetic data (mass-specific magnetic susceptibility, anhysteretic remanent magnetisation, isothermal remanent magnetisation and inter-parametric ratios) on 57 samples of suspended sediment from the Bhadra River in the Sahyadri (the Western Ghat) of India have been used in this study. Samples were collected upstream, adjacent to and downstream of Kudremukh, a mountainous and high rainfall site where the largest mechanised open-cast mine in south Asia was located. Graphical and multivariate analyses and modelling of the data show that on average ~29% of the river suspended load downstream of the mine is derived from mining and allied activities at Kudremukh although the mine occupies less than 5% of the catchment. The contribution of primary ore is the maximum (18%), followed by transitional hard weathered ore (7%) and weathered ore (4%). The model has done a fairly good job of unmixing; the sum of errors is <1 for 40 samples, for five samples and >71,000 for four samples. Modelling of samples with small mass seems to produce large errors. This investigation demonstrates the utility of environmental magnetic data, which can be obtained in a simple and rapid manner, and the unmixing of such data in identifying the contribution of mining activities to the total suspended sediment load.\\'Abstract: \\'\\'Abstract: \\'This study presents statistical analysis of hydrogeochemical data of the groundwater samples collected from the layered formations of the Cretaceous, Tertiary (Lower Cuddalore and Upper Cuddalore) and Quaternary in Pondicherry region, South India. It focuses on the sources, controls and geochemical processes occurring in these formations. The results obtained from statistical analysis of 11 important hydrochemical parameters indicate dissimilar elemental correlations among aquifers. Quaternary aquifer exhibit good correlations among ion pairs and indicating source controls like salts from unsaturated zone, fertilizers, industrial wastes and also processes like ion exchange. Upper and lower Tertiary aquifers have good correlations among ions as indicating dominant role of silicate rock weathering processes, while Cretaceous formation show high correlations among indicating carbonate and sulphate mineral contribution. High positive ion correlations among observed in Cretaceous formation reflects contribution from marine sources. The study has also brought out the three major processes active in theses aquifers like parental, anthropogenic and mixing. The spatial distribution of the factor score for individual groundwater samples reveals the sources of the constituents that are in good agreement with those deduced from the geological and hydrogeological evidences. A conceptual geochemical model is developed to improve the understanding of this complex multi-layered aquifer system that would help the water authorities to plan for judicious exploitation of groundwater resources management without significantly hampering the groundwater quality.\\'Abstract: \\'The population structure of Labeo calbasu from 11 rivers belonging to the Indus, Ganges, Bhima, Mahanadi, and Godavari basins was investigated using allozyme marker systems. Seven out of 20 allozyme loci (35%) were polymorphic Both probability and score tests indicated significant deviation of genotype proportions from expectations at two loci, XDH* (Mahanadi, Bhima, and Godavari) and G6PDH* (Mahanadi). A pairwise genetic homogeneity test and F ST values indicated a low-to-moderate level (0.0515) of genetic structuring in the wild population of L. calbasu. AMOVA analysis also indicated moderate differentiation among the samples from different river basins. Analysis for genetic bottleneck was performed under the infinite allele model. The study revealed nine genetic stocks of L. calbasu from the natural population across Indian rivers. Evidence of genetic bottlenecks in some rivers was also revealed.\\'Abstract: \\'Conservation of biodiversity and mitigation of global warming are two major environmental challenges today. In this context, the relationship between biodiversity (especially plant diversity) and soil carbon (C) sequestration (as a means of mitigating global warming) has become a subject of considerable scientific interest. This relationship was tested for homegardens (HG), a popular and sustainable agroforestry system in the tropics, in Thrissur district, Kerala, India. The major objectives were to examine how tree density and plant-stand characteristics of homegardens affect soil C sequestration. Soil samples were collected at four depths from HG of varying sizes and age classes, and their total C content determined. Tree density and plant-stand characteristics such as species richness (Margalef Index) and diversity (Shannon Index) of the HG were also determined. Results indicated that the soil C stock was directly related to plant diversity of HG. Homegardens with higher, compared to those with lower, number of plant species, as well as higher species richness and tree density had higher soil carbon, especially in the top of soil. Overall, within profile, soil C content ranged from 101.5 to Smaller-sized HG that had higher tree density and plant-species density had more soil C per unit area of land than larger-sized ones Soil C content, especially below was higher in older gardens. The enhanced soil-C storage in species-rich homegardens could have relevance and applications in broader ecological contexts.\\'Abstract: \\'Water samples were collected from three selected mangrove ecosystems of Kali Estuary west coast Karwar, on monthly basis and analyzed for various hydrographic parameters. The present work would give the recent information on the hydrographic condition of the mangrove ecosystem of Kali estuary. Surface water temperature varied from 27.4 to and the salinity ranged between 4.1 and pH ranged between 7.00 and 8.89. Variation in dissolved oxygen content was from 2.46 to and suspended matter ranged between 0.03 and Concentrations of nutrients viz. phosphates nitrates nitrites and silicate also varied independently. The results of the study revealed that hydrographical conditions fluctuated moderately throughout the year.\\'Abstract: \\'This paper presents an overview of the use of lineaments in landslide hazard mapping. The lineaments are normally derived either from aerial photographs or satellite imagery. The relative advantages and disadvantages of digital image processing and manual (visual) lineament interpretation are discussed. Most researchers prefer the manual technique, despite the fact it is more time-consuming and subjective, as it allows a higher degree of operator control. Ways of increasing objectivity in the interpretation are suggested. It is hoped that lineament mapping will increasingly be incorporated in landslide hazard assessment hence the paper emphasizes the need for care and a proper understanding of these methods and their limitations.\\'Abstract: \\'The Puntius denisonii colloquially and more popularly referred to as Miss Kerala is a subtropical fish belonging to the genus Puntius (Barb) and family Cyprinidae. Two cell lines PDF and PDH were developed from the caudal fin and heart of P. denisonii, respectively. The cell lines were optimally maintained at in Leibovitz-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. A diploid count of 50 chromosomes at passage 50 was observed in both the cell lines. The high growth potential of the cell lines was reflected from the cell doubling time of 28 and of PDF and PDH cell lines, respectively. The viability of the PDF and PDH cell lines was 70% and 76%, respectively, after of storage in liquid nitrogen The origin of the cell lines was confirmed by the amplification of fragments of cytochrome oxidase subunit I of mitochondrial DNA genes.\\'Abstract: \\'Digha coastal region in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal is potentially vulnerable to erosional hazard. The present study assessed the coastal erosion vulnerability along this long coastal stretch located between Rasulpur (Midnapur) and Subarnarekha (Balasore) estuarine complex, which had been subjected to anthropogenic intervention. Multi-resolution Landsat satellite imagery were used for shoreline change study from 1972 to 2010. During this period, accretion was recorded updrift of artificial structures, viz, seawall, groin, pylons and jetties; while, extensive erosion was recorded in downdrift areas of these structures. Assessment was subsequently divided into four categories ranging from to Data from several sources were compiled to map landuse and human activities in the coastal zone. This map was divided into four categories, ranging from high to landuse. Population density map of the surrounding coastal villages was generated using census data, and divided into four categories ranging from density to low density Subsequently, coastal erosion vulnerability was assessed by combining coastal retreat with landuse type and population density in this study area using simple vector algebraic technique. Zones of vulnerability of different magnitude (viz., very high, high, moderate, and low) have been identified. Furthermore, calculation of collapse zone shows that maximum values are around artificial structures and anthropogenic activities. The coastal erosion vulnerability map prepared from this study can be used for proper planning and management of this coastal region.\\'Abstract: \\'Rivers in the southwest coast of India are under immense pressure due to various kinds of human activities among which indiscriminate extraction of construction grade sand is the most disastrous one. The situation is rather alarming in the rivers draining the Vembanad lake catchments as the area hosts one of the fast developing urban-cum-industrial centre, the Kochi city, otherwise called the Queen of Arabian Sea. The Vembanad lake catchments are drained by seven rivers whose length varies between 78 and and catchment area between 847 and On an average, of sand and gravel are being extracted from the active channels and of sand from the river floodplains. The quantity of instream mining is about 40 times the higher than the sand input estimated in the gauging stations. As a result of indiscriminate sand mining, the riverbed in the storage zone is getting lowered at a rate of over the past two decades. This, in turn, imposes severe damages to the physical and biological environments of these river systems. The present paper deals with the environmental effects of indiscriminate sand mining from the small catchment rivers in the southwest coast of India, taking the case of the rivers draining the Vembanad lake catchments as an example.\\'Abstract: \\'This paper reports the evolution of rain drop size distribution (DSD) during bright band (BB) and no-BB (NBB) conditions of low intensity rainfall events as observed by a vertically pointing Micro Rain Radar (MRR) over Pune India. The BB is identified by enhanced radar reflectivity factor Z (dBZ) at the isotherm. The gradient of hydrometeor fall velocity is found to be a good indicator in identifying the melting layer when enhanced radar reflectivity at melting layer is not prominent. The storm structures as observed by the MRR are compared with CloudSat observations that provide evidence of ice hydrometeor at with clear indication of BB at Storm heights at warmer than are evident during NBB conditions from CloudSat. This suggests that warm rain processes are responsible for producing rain during NBB conditions. During BB conditions, bimodal DSDs below the melting layer are observed at lower altitudes. The DSDs of shallow warm precipitating systems of NBB conditions are monomodal at all the altitudes. Significantly, normalized DSDs are found to be bimodal for BB conditions, and monomodal for NBB conditions which confirm different dominant microphysical processes. It is found that the observed bimodal DSDs during BB conditions are mainly due to the collision, coalescence and break-up processes. During NBB conditions, number and size of large raindrops grow while reaching the ground without much breakup. The radar reflectivity and rainfall intensity R relationship of the form  b  are found out for BB and NBB conditions. Existing different microphysical processes lead to large coefficient in the relationship with small exponent during BB conditions while during NBB conditions the coefficients are small with large exponents.\\'Abstract: \\'A study was carried out on seed characteristics of nine different tree species of six botanical families for germination and viability during three years, and Average germination percentages after 5, 10 and were 27.22, 55.56 and for all nine species. Highest germination percentage was recorded in two species of bombacaceae, viz., Bombax ceiba followed by Ceiba pentandra L Rest of the species showed less than germination after of incubation. After seedling length was highest in B. ceiba, followed by Leucaena leucocphala with values of 16.20 and respectively. Average seedling vigor index (SVI) was 59.08 after which increased regularly with values of 479.38 and 865.11 after 10 and Highest SVI was recorded in B. ceiba, following by Sterculia urens at all the stages after 5, 10 and Average viability was among all species, with highest value of for Albizia lebbeck. Two species, viz., C. pentandra and Delonix regia exhibited lowest viability of Root length/shoot length (RL/SL) ratio decreased with age from 9.86 at after germination to 0.75 and 0.52 at 10 and after germination, respectively. In general seeds were recalcitrant type. Knowledge on germination, pattern and viability is not only important for understanding community process but also for framing strategies for conservation of biodiversity and restoration of forests.\\'Abstract: wrote several treatises on Advaita philosophy.

The goodness of fit was tested. The analysis showed that the vegetation index which is the ratio of reflectance of vegetation in near infrared band to red wave band of electromagnetic spectrum is highly correlated to forest growing stock and the same can be used to predict the volume in remote forest areas for quick assessment purpose. Implications for future forest inventory are discussed.\\'Abstract: \\'This paper documents the concentration of total arsenic and individual arsenic species in four soft-bottom benthic polychaetes (Perenereis cultifera, Ganganereis sootai, Lumbrinereis notocirrata and Dendronereis arborifera) along with host sediments from Sundarban mangrove wetland, India. An additional six sites were considered exclusively for surface sediments for this purpose. Polychaetes were collected along with the host sediments and measured for their total arsenic content using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Arsenic concentrations in polychaete body tissues varied greatly, suggesting species-specific characteristics and inherent peculiarities in arsenic metabolism. Arsenic was generally present in polychaetes as arsenate (AsV ranges from 0.16 to or arsenite (AsIII ranges from 0.10 to as inorganic As) and dimethylarsinic acid Arsenobetaine and PO4-arsenoriboside were also detected as minor constituents, whilst monomethylarsonic acid (MAV) was not detected in any of the polychaetes. The highest total As dry wt) was observed in the polychaete D. arborifera collected from the vicinity of a sewage outfall in which the majority of As was present as an uncharacterised compound dry wt) eluted prior to AB. Host sediments ranged from 2.5 to of total As. This work supports the importance of speciation analysis of As, because of the ubiquitous occurrence of this metalloid in the environment, and its variable toxicity depending on chemical form. It is also the first work to report the composition of As species in polychaetes from the Indian Sundarban wetlands.\\'Abstract: \\'Molecular data are increasingly being used to resolve cryptic species complexes; however, subsequent formal species description and taxonomic revisions often remain incomplete. Given that most species are described based on morphology-based alpha taxonomy, one cannot resolve nomenclatural issues of species complexes without the aid of morphology. In this study, we examined the taxonomic status of a long-known human commensal and species complex, Hemidactylus brookii. To this end, samples of H. cf. brookii and related species were collected across India. We analyzed molecular as well as morphological data to resolve the taxonomy of this species complex. Seven deeply divergent, well-supported clades were recovered using the mitochondrial phylogeny, five of which were also retrieved in the nuclear tree. One of these consists of five morphologically distinct species of ground-dwelling Hemidactylus. The genetic distances across each clade of putative species of H. brookii sensu lato were comparable to that between morphologically distinct species of ground-dwelling Hemidactylus. Meristic characters such as number of precloacal-femoral pores, number of non-pore bearing scales interrupting the series of pored scales, dorsal pholidosis, and presence/absence of divided lamellae can be used to distinguish these putative species from each other. However, morphological characters of H. brookii sensu stricto did not correspond to any of the putative species studied. The study also revealed that the brookii in India includes two commensal species, Hemidactylus parvimaculatus and Hemidactylus murrayi. Furthermore, these two lineages have independently acquired adaptations that could have assisted them in exploiting human habitat. An identification key to diagnose species within this complex and rest of the Hemidactylus in India is proposed.\\'Abstract: of the coastal region are significant and serve as a fragile ecosystem in the sedimentary terrain. The Pondicherry region is characterized by different geological formations of distinct geological epochs Cretaceous, Tertiary and Quaternary. Ninety-three samples were collected from specific aquifers with respect to spatial distribution [Alluvium (31), Upper Cuddalore (13), Lower Cuddalore (13), Other Tertiary (7), Cretaceous (24) and completion aquifer (5)]. The collected samples were analyzed for major ions Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3 PO4 SO4 F and DOC. Stables isotopes of and 13C were also analyzed along with heavy metals like Al, Ba, Fe, Sr, Cd and Zn. The ranges between and and ranges between and The distribution of these environmental isotopes in groundwater of this layered aquifer sequence was also attempted. A comparison of the isotopic data with the rainfall, Local Meteoric Water Line with a equation of * Indian Meteoric Water Line and Global Meteoric Water Line was performed. The values for groundwater ranges from to The result indicates that the groundwater in the study area is mainly meteoric in origin, and few samples show evidence of evaporation. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a very important component in biogeochemical cycling of elements characterized by high susceptibility to leaching. The range of the DOC in the study area is Factor analysis was applied to classify the groundwater samples and to identify geochemical processes controlling groundwater geochemistry. The Alluvium aquifers show a complex hydrogeochemistry than the older aquifers. The major factor influencing the hydrogeochemistry of the region is interaction and anthropogenic processes. Hence, metal mobility of the groundwater shows the correlation of metal bonding and DOC. The relation between the DOC and heavy metal concentration in the aquifers was also identified.\\'Abstract: \\'Assessment of possible sources that control the groundwater quality was carried out in the Cauvery deltaic region, India, since domestic and agricultural water requirements are largely met by groundwater abstraction. Major ion and bromide contents are high in groundwater in the coastal wells. Spatial and vertical distributions of ions reveal that the shallow wells and wells in coastal parts have high chloride, nitrate, ammonium and phosphate. Groundwater quality assessment was carried out using the prescribed limits of World Health Organization and Bureau of Indian Standards which indicates that of samples are not fit for drinking. Integrated suitability map for drinking was created based on the concept that if the water sample exceeds any one of the standards by World Health Organization or Bureau of Indian Standards, the well is not fit for drinking. Groundwater quality for agricultural activities was assessed using electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, United States salinity laboratory diagram and Food and Agricultural Organization methods. According to Food and Agricultural Organization, of samples are classified as low sodium water and are suitable for all crops and soils. It was found that the water quality in this area is affected by improper disposal of waste, sewage/drainage canals near the wells, irrigation return flow, application of agrochemicals and saline water intrusion in the coastal region. Further, integrated suitability map produced in this study will be useful for future groundwater development and planning in this area. The suitability map needs to be updated periodically for proper management plan to preserve the groundwater resource in this region.\\'Abstract: \\'Fluoride contamination in soil was studied in the vicinity of a hot spring in Nayagarh district of Orissa. Both bulk soil from 0 to depth and profile soils from 0 to depth were analyzed for total fluoride (F t ) and 0.01 M CaCl2 extractable fluoride (F ca ), major elements, pH, EC and Organic Carbon (OC). High concentrations of both F t  and F ca  were observed in the area surrounding the hot spring and the village of Singhpur. Principal factor analysis (PFA) on the parameters of the bulk soils suggests that two major chemical processes due to three factors, control the soil geochemistry of the area. Factor-1 contributes 37.11% of the total variance and is strongly loaded with Al, Si, Fe, F t and F ca , and explains the fluoride enrichment of the soil, whereas the second and the third factors contribute 16.6 and 12.2%, respectively and explain the controlling process of carbonate precipitation and soil alkalinity. Multiple regression analysis of the scores of the factors was performed to derive a fluoride contamination index in soil. The magnitude of the factor effect on the contamination index follows the order of Factor-1 > Factor-2 > Factor-3. The spatial distribution of the contamination index is used to classify the area into highly contaminated, moderately contaminated and uncontaminated zones.\\'Abstract: \\'Estimation of spatial plant distribution of a large area is very tedious and time consuming assignment. In this regard, herbaria of the world are supposed to be the excellent repositories of the plant collections for reference purpose. But many repositories of the world do not have the associated information of the collections and thus it becomes a muddle for future studies. The aim of this study is to know the extent of this mess. Therefore, spatial distribution of Berberidaceae members in NW Himalaya was studied through available herbarium data in three herbaria at Department of Botany, University of Jammu, Janaki Ammal Herbarium, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine and Herbarium, Department of Botany, Punjabi University. It is observed that the collected specimens in aforesaid herbaria are correctly identified; but simultaneously, proper collection sites and collection dates are not mentioned for some specimens. Therefore, it is difficult to recollect the species. This is also revealed that India harbours 04 genera (Berberis, Epimedium, Mahonia and Nandina) and 22 species of the Berberidaceae, out of which 02 (Berberis and Mahonia) are reported from the NW Himalaya.\\'Abstract: \\'This article briefly discusses the evolution of ecosystem approaches, and illustrates the use of ecosystem approaches to assess human health and well-being in a mining context. It discusses the various elements that help distinguish such approaches from other approaches. Well-being here is understood broadly in terms of its and of which health is an important constituent. Ecological, health, and social assessments highlighted a number of impacts from mining activity in Goa, India. These generated a list of issues of concern that were validated by industry, and served as a basis for the development of tools to track mining-induced changes in health and well-being. The article concludes by reflecting on some of the challenges posed by the use of ecosystem approaches to assessing human health and well-being.\\'Abstract: \\' The surface sediments of Vembanad Lake, a tropical estuary on the west coast of India, were analyzed for carbon (TC, TOC, TIC), nitrogen (TN), amino acids and two amino sugars. C/N ratios for the surface sediments vary from indicating terrestrial sources of organic matter. Various biogeochemical indicators based on amino acids such as and ratios revealed that the organic matter in the 5- to 10-cm surface sediments was fresh and had not undergone extensive degradation. However, the Gluam/Galam ratio for surface sediments of Vembanad Lake varies from indicating the dominance of bacterial biomass in the sediments. Organic matter in the sediments was found to be highly reactive, with a reactivity index ranging from suggesting rapid remineralization.\\'Cashew\\'Abstract: \\'Population dynamics of the egg parasitoids of the tea mosquito bug, Helopeltis antonii was investigated between June 2010 and May 2013. Three species of egg parasitoids attacked Helopeltis spp. in cashew orchards viz. Telenomus cuspis Rajmohana and Srikumar, Chaetostricha sp. and Erthymelus helopeltidis Gahan. T. cuspis was the most abundant species and was recorded throughout the year with the exception of March and April. It showed the maximum parasitism rate during the monsoon exhibiting a significant and positive correlation with rainfall The occurrence of Chaetostricha sp. and E. helopeltidis was occasional (1.80 and respectively) during December, showing a significant and negative correlation with the minimum temperature The development time of T. cuspis was Longevity was significantly shorter for male than for female Elements of parasitoid foraging behaviour such as antennal drumming, ovipositor insertion, egg marking, walking and resting were also observed. The level of parasitism provided by T. cuspis suggests a good potential for biological control against Helopeltis spp.\\'Information available on species composition, richness and diversity of ant communities of Western Ghats is limited. Recognizing this, the study (2010−2013) was undertaken to evaluate richness and diversity of ants in eight sites of Western Ghats, India, with added notes on how it varies on elevation gradient. Spanning across broad altitudinal and latitudinal gradient, selected sites differed greatly for various micro-habitat variables. Using standard collection protocols and employing five collection techniques, 173 species belonging to 65 genera in 10 subfamilies were collected including twenty species published as new to science and two genera and six species reported for the first time from India. Varying among sites, species richness was recorded lowest (S =\\u202f29) at Manalar and highest (S\\u202f=\\u202f116) at Periyar Tiger Reserve. With little but significant variations among sites, the Shannon-Wiener\\'s species diversity index (H′) was recorded highest (H′\\u202f=\\u202f2.60) at Periyar Tiger Reserve and lowest (H′\\u202f=\\u202f2.11) at Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary connoting that sites with lower richness were not necessarily less diverse. Beta diversity (β-diversity) was lowest (19%) between contiguous sites like Thattekkad Bird Sanctuary and Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary and highest between site Manalar and Periyar Tiger Reserve at 68% suggesting that ant species composition distinctly varied in these sites. Our results indicated that only few species were adapted to full spectrum of environmental variation along altitudinal gradient studied and both species richness and diversity peaked at mid-elevations as against higher elevations wherein it underwent rapid decline. Such behavior is presumably due to favorable ecological conditions at middle altitudes. Our findings rank high as they not only provide baseline data against which futuristic faunal changes could be assessed with respect to perturbations in a biodiversity hotspot but they also could be used to designate ecological sensitivities to various regions of Western Ghats for future conservation programs.Rattans, or canes, are one of the most important non-timber forest products supporting the livelihood of many forest-dwelling communities in South and North-eastern India. Due to increased demand for rattan products, rattans have been extracted indiscriminately from the Western Ghats, a 1600-km mountain chain running parallel to the west coast of India. Extensive harvesting, loss of habitat and poor regeneration has resulted in dwindling rattan populations, necessitating an urgent attempt to conserve existing rattan resources. In this study, using niche-modelling tools, an attempt has been made to identify areas of high species richness of rattans in the Western Ghats, one of the mega-diversity regions of the world. We have also developed conservation values for 21 economically important and endemic rattans of the Western Ghats. We identified at least two to three sites of extremely high species richness outside the existing protected area network that should be prioritized for in situ conservation. This study emphasizes the need to develop strategies for the long-term conservation of rattans in the Western Ghats, India.We collated data on the latitudinal, elevation and seasonality ranges, local densities, stature and dispersal mode of 514 evergreen tree species (≥10\\u202fcm girth at breast height), including 317 endemics, from the rain forests of the Western Ghats (WG) of India using two complementary databases, (i) 68 tree inventory plots, and (ii) the Atlas of Endemics. We tested the hypotheses that (i) regional rarity would be associated with local rarity and narrower ecological amplitudes, (ii) shorter and mechanically dispersed trees would be rarer, (iii) higher proportion of endemic species would be rare (iv) regionally wide ranging species would be locally rare, and localised species would be denser, (v) families with single species would be relicts in this biome, (vi) larger families would have a higher proportion of rare and endemic species. We used Atlas records in a generalised least square model acknowledging phylogenetic relationships, to test hypotheses (i) to (ii), and non parametric tests for (iii) to (vi). We identified rare species using binary cut-offs and compared these with IUCN threat status. Rarity was associated with (i) narrower ecological amplitudes and shorter stature, independent of phylogeny, (ii) 18 wide ranging and locally sparse, 41 narrow ranging and locally dense species, (iii) relict species and families, (iv) larger families. Rare species were more likely to be threatened, but 39% were not evaluated. We identified zones of rare endemics to help with conservation planning. The WG rain forests have a unique evolutionary history and potential that require increased conservation measures.Wildlife utilization in the tropics is massive, with nearly 5 million tons of bushmeat consumed by local communities. In India, a megadiversity nation, hunting—although illegal—is widespread among indigenous communities. However, the extent, frequency, and rationale for hunting, and factors influencing wildlife utilization are poorly known. Our study, based on 19 different indigenous communities in the Western Ghats region, revealed the utilization of 54 wild species/taxa. Although freshwater fish, herpetofauna, and small mammals were most frequently utilized, enforcement by the Forest Department was largely focused on large mammals. Gender, land ownership, number of domestic meats consumed, distance to markets, time spent hunting, and distance to hunting areas were major factors that affected wild meat utilization in the region. Although conservation needs to be focused on the most utilized groups, increasing access to domestic meats at remote settlements and integrating utilization of common, culturally prominent species can improve conservation of threatened fauna.A meaningful effort for the preservation of endemism would require a deep understanding of its related mechanisms and an accurate estimation of its spatial distribution. Here, we applied methods dedicated to species distribution modelling (SDM) to map an integrated index in India\\'s Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, the endemic tree richness, and to use it for recommendations of protected areas. We then rigorously compared SDM results with spatially explicit and multiscale comparison tools, among them the cutting-edge correlation map and profile (CMP) technique, to finally draw up an endemic richness map with improved accuracy.The endemic richness showed a sharply increasing southward gradient in the Western Ghats, mainly driven by the seasonality of the temperature and the precipitation\\'s stability. This precise quantification of the tree endemism pattern in peninsular India helped in identifying vulnerable areas in terms of conservation of biodiversity as a whole. The Indian authorities recently used our recommendations to extend protected areas in the southern tip of the Indian peninsula to conserve this endemic richness. We believe that spatial analyses and multiscale comparison tools such as those presented here can help conservationists everywhere to better cope with the difficulties met in identifying zones for protected status.Identifying and prioritising naturally occurring within-species diversity, which may correlate with local adaptations or vicariance, is an integral part of conservation planning. Using non-invasive sampling and a panel of 11 microsatellites on 158 individual tigers from a pan India sample, our evaluation revealed three population clusters in India: unique North-Eastern tigers, a combined cluster of Western Ghats, Western India and Terai tigers, and a mixed cluster from Central India. At further population division, tigers from Odisha, Valmiki and southern Western Ghats were distinct. Central Indian tigers were most diverse, but showed the highest level of local structuring, suggestive of human induced fragmentation. We show that tigers in India are genetically structured and some clusters are unique. Considering a combined analysis of population size, genetic diversity and uniqueness, tigers from the North-East hills, and southern Western Ghats emerge as conservation priorities. We propose reintroductions and supplementation of tigers be done among the same broad genetic clusters. Restoration and management of habitat corridors is vital for anthropogenically fragmented Central Indian populations. This study suggests a paradigm shift from indiscriminately doubling tiger numbers to prioritising conservation of naturally occurring diversity amongst tigers, to retain their full evolutionary potential, while managing to mitigate anthropogenic induced genetic structuring.Detailed mapping and regular monitoring of tropical rainforests is important for conservation and management of highly fragmented tropical rainforest habitats and biodiversity. Several studies have observed that it is highly challenging to map different vegetation types in tropical rainforests due to large environmental heterogeneity, high topographical variability and near constant cloud cover. In the present study, we assessed the capability of optical multispectral Sentinel-2 MSI bands, their derived NDVI and textures, and SAR Sentinel-1 bands and their textures to discriminate different vegetation types in the tropical rainforests of the Western Ghats using maximum likelihood and random forest classification. We also compared the results of our classification with previous such maps of the study area. Finally, we evaluated the magnitude of habitat fragmentation by using derived landscape metrics. Our classification had high accuracy (>75%), especially compared to previous classification efforts. Our results emphasise the significance of using vegetation indices and textures for vegetation type classification in the Western Ghats. Furthermore, the results suggest that rainforest habitats and other agro-ecosystems, suitable as habitats for numerous plant and animal species, are highly fragmented and require top conservation priority. High spectral and spatial resolution, continuity, affordability and access makes Sentinel-2 one of the best options for regular monitoring of tropical rainforests.Human-modified tropical landscapes under semi-natural or agro-ecosystems often harbor biodiversity of significant conservation value. In the Western Ghats of India, these ecosystems also provide connectivity between protected areas and other remnant forests. We investigated the conservation value of these landscapes and agro-ecosystems using results from 35 studies covering 14 taxonomic groups. Large, conspicuous taxonomic groups and tree-covered land-use types have received much focus in this area of research in the Western Ghats. We computed a response ratio defined as the log ratio of species richness in human land use to species richness in forest control site from 17 studies. In a meta-analysis, we investigated variation of this ratio across studies with respect to three variables: taxonomic group, the land-use type sampled and the extent of forest cover within the study landscape. Higher forest cover within the landscape emerged as a major positive influence on biodiversity in human-modified landscapes for vertebrates and vegetation while no patterns emerged for invertebrates. Our results suggest that loss of remnant forest patches from these landscapes is likely to reduce biodiversity within agro-ecosystems and exacerbate overall biodiversity loss across the Western Ghats. Conservation of these remnant forest patches through protection and restoration of habitat and connectivity to larger forest patches needs to be prioritized. In the densely populated Western Ghats, this can only be achieved by building partnerships with local land owners and stakeholders through innovative land-use policy and incentive schemes for conservation.The validity of the threat status assigned to a species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature\\'s (IUCN) Red List relies heavily on the accuracy of the geographic range size estimate for that species. Range maps used to assess threat status often contain large areas of unsuitable habitat, thereby overestimating range and underestimating threat. In this study, we assessed 18 endemic birds of the Western Ghats to test the accuracy of the geographic range sizes used by the IUCN for their threat assessment. Using independently reviewed data from the world\\'s largest citizen science database (eBird) within a species distribution modeling framework, our results show that: (a) geographic ranges have been vastly overestimated by IUCN for 17 of the 18 endemic bird species; (b) range maps used by IUCN contain large areas of unsuitable habitat, and (c) ranges estimated in this study suggest provisional uplisting of IUCN threat status for at least 10 of the 18 species based on area metrics used by the IUCN for threat assessment. Since global range size is an important parameter for assigning IUCN threat status, citizen science datasets, high resolution and freely available geo-referenced ecological data, and the latest species distribution modeling techniques should be used to estimate and track changes in range extent whenever possible. The methods used here to significantly revise range estimates have important conservation management implications not only for endemic birds in the Western Ghats, but for vertebrate and invertebrate taxa worldwide.Large mammals are declining globally due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Climate change is one of the factors known to alter the range of several mammalian species. An early understanding of the effect of climate change on species distributions can provide critical information for conservation planning. Nilgiritragus hylocrius (Nilgiri Tahr) is an endangered ungulate that is restricted to the montane grasslands of the Western Ghats, India. Currently, the Nilgiri Tahr is restricted to a fraction of its former range and is also prone to risks due to several ongoing anthropogenic pressures. However, the impact of global climate change on this emblematic species has seldom been estimated. The goal of our study was to use ecological niche models to quantify the effect of climate change on the habitats of Nilgiri Tahr. Using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm, we modelled the potential distribution of Nilgiri Tahr in its native range. The models were developed under the current climatic conditions and then projected onto two future climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and for three different time frames in the future (years 2030, 2050 and 2080). We identified that most of the climatically suitable habitats of Nilgiri Tahr would become unsuitable when global warming intensifies. Our models predicted a complete loss of suitable habitats in many existing protected areas in the Western Ghats. We use insights provided by our modeling results to propose conservation management plans to increase the likelihood of persistence of Nilgiri Tahr in the Western Ghats.Climate change has the potential to have significant influence on distribution of many species and alter ecosystems. With the current estimates of rate of projected environmental change for the 21st century, urgent adaptation and mitigation measures are required to slow down the impact of climate change on biodiversity. A number of studies have shown that recent human-induced environmental changes have already triggered species range shifts, changes in phenology and species extinctions. However, accurate projections of species responses to future climate change are more difficult to ascertain. In recent years, a number of modeling tools are being used to predict the consequences of climate change on the distribution of species and also identify possible ecological niche of a species under different climate change scenarios.In this paper, using the distribution data of the species, we have attempted to (a) identify the current geographical distribution of five species of the family Myristicaceae and predict the possible sites of occurrence of these species in the Western Ghats, India using the niche modeling tools and (b) predict the impact of climate change on the potential distribution of these species for two scenarios (A1B and A2A). All the five species selected for the study are distributed in the Western Ghats with higher densities in the Central Western Ghats. The model predicted an overall increase in the suitable habitats for the non-swampy species. However, there is a shift in the habitat range of these species in response to climate change. Gymnocranthera canarica and Myristica fatua, which are obligate swampy species, tend to be affected in changing climate. For both these species, the overall habitat is reduced due to climate change. These species already have restricted habitat and therefore climate change could pose a serious threat for their future survival. Predicting how species distribution will change in the wake of future global climate change is important to develop effective conservation strategies for these species, which inhabit fragile ecosystems.The ongoing introduction of the exotic Grevillea robusta tree species into agroforestry systems (AFS) of the Indian Western Ghats could become a threat to both climate change mitigation and tree diversity conservation.Here, we quantified carbon (C) storage and shade tree diversity in native forests and coffee AFS under contrasted management (native versus exotic shade trees, Robusta versus Arabica systems) at 67 plots along a 3500\\u202fmm precipitation gradient in the Cauvery watershed, India.Despite a substantial reduction of shade tree cover in native AFS compared to forest (from 90% to 32% in the high precipitation area), native AFS and forests displayed high and comparable C stocks (max. 228 MgC ha−1 and 234 MgC ha-1, respectively) and tree diversity (max. 44 and 45 species, respectively). Both variables were negatively impacted by the introduction of G. robusta, especially in Robusta coffee systems (max. 158 MgC ha−1, 12 species).The current trend toward the introduction of G. robusta in coffee AFS of the study area (exotic agroforestry) negatively affects C storage and tree diversity, especially in Robusta coffee systems. Policy makers should take advantage of the carbon-tree diversity positive correlation found in the agroforestry landscape of the Western Ghats of India to promote conservation and climate change mitigation.The diversity of hillstream loaches in the northern part of the Western Ghats region of India was studied for the first time using two mitochondrial genes, cytochrome oxidase subunit I and cytochrome b. Phylogenetic analysis revealed monophyletic groups corresponding to the genera Indoreonectes, Paracanthocobitis, Nemacheilus, Schistura and Nemachilichthys (family Nemacheilidae), and Balitora, Lepidocephalichthys and Botia (families Balitoridae, Cobitidae and Botiidae respectively). While there was little inter-population genetic divergence for genera such as Nemacheilus, Nemachilichthys, Balitora and Botia, each of which harbored a single species, there were distinct clades observed for Indoreonectes, Paracanthocobitis, Schistura and Lepidocephalichthys, which were supported through species delimitation by Poisson Tree Processes, Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescence and barcode gap analysis. We show that Indoreonectes evezardi, currently considered to be a wide-ranging species, is a ‘complex’ comprising of several genetically distinct clades indicating the presence of undescribed species. Further, we also suggest a possibility of hidden species diversity within the genera Paracanthocobitis, Schistura and Lepidocephalichthys. Based on different species delimitation methods, we suggest that there could be between 23 and 31 species of loaches belonging to eight genera and four families in the northern part of the Western Ghats of India. Our study substantially contributes to the understanding of the diversity and conservation status of loaches in this region.In recent years, climate change has become a major threat and has been widely documented in the geographic distribution of many plant species. However, the impacts of climate change on the distribution of ecologically vulnerable medicinal species remain largely unknown. The identification of a suitable habitat for a species under climate change scenario is a significant step towards the mitigation of biodiversity decline. The study, therefore, aims to predict the impact of current, and future climatic scenarios on the distribution of the threatened Garcinia indica across the northern Western Ghats using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modelling. The future projections were made for the year 2050 and 2070 with all Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenario (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) using 56 species occurrence data, and 19 bioclimatic predictors from the BCC-CSM1.1 model of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change’s (IPCC) 5th assessment. The bioclimatic variables were minimised to a smaller number of variables after a multicollinearity test, and their contributions were assessed using jackknife test. The AUC value of 0.956\\u202f±\\u202f0.023 indicates that the model performs with excellent accuracy. The study identified that temperature seasonality (39.5\\u202f±\\u202f3.1%), isothermality (19.2\\u202f±\\u202f1.6%), and annual precipitation (12.7\\u202f±\\u202f1.7%) would be the major influencing variables in the current and future distribution. The model predicted 10.50% (19318.7\\u202fsq.\\u202fkm) of the study area as moderately to very highly suitable, while 82.60% (151904\\u202fsq.\\u202fkm) of the study area was identified as ‘unsuitable’ or ‘very low suitable’. Our predictions of Climate change impact on habitat suitability suggest that there will be a drastic reduction in the suitability by 5.29% and 5.69% under RCP 8.5 for 2050 and 2070, respectively.Objective and SignificancePrimary objective of this study is to identify the potential distribution of medicinally and ecologically important but threatened Garcinia indica species in the northern Western Ghats on the basis of species occurrence data and nineteen bioclimatic predictors. Using MaxEnt modelling, current and future species distribution and suitability has been predicted using the BCC-CSM1.1 and four RCP scenarios of 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5. The results also signify the bioclimatic variables contribution to the species distribution in northern Western Ghats.Finally, the results signify that the model might be an efficient tool for biodiversity protection, ecosystem management, and species re-habitation planning under future climate change scenarios.Areas of high conservation value were identified in the Western Ghats using a systematic conservation planning approach. Surrogates were chosen and assessed for effectiveness on the basis of spatial congruence using Pearson’s correlations and Mantel’s tests. The surrogates were, threatened and endemic plant and vertebrate species, unfragmented forest areas, dry forests, sub-regionally rare vegetation types, and a remotely sensed surrogate for unique evergreen ecosystems. At the scale of this analysis, amphibian richness was most highly correlated with overall threatened and endemic species richness, whereas mammals, especially wide-ranging species, were better at capturing overall animal and habitat diversity. There was a significant relationship between a remote sensing based habitat surrogate and endemic tree diversity and composition. None of the taxa or habitats served as a complete surrogate for the others. Sites were prioritised on the basis of their irreplaceability value using all five surrogates. Two alternative reserve networks are presented, one with minimal representation of surrogates, and the second with 3 occurrences of each species and 25% of each habitat type. These networks cover 8% and 29% of the region respectively. Seventy percent of the completely irreplaceable sites are outside the current protected area network. While the existing protected area network meets the minimal representation target for 88% of the species chosen in this study and all of the habitat surrogates, it is not representative with regard to amphibians, endemic tree species and small mammals. Much of the prioritised unprotected area is under reserve forests and can thus be incorporated into a wider network of conservation areas.Emilia reddyi is described and illustrated as a new species from the Eastern Ghats of Andhra Pradesh, India. It resembles Emilia scabra, Emilia javanica, and Emilia sonchifolia, but is distinct by the stem which is woody at the base, the strictly cauline leaves, and floral characters. A description, information on habitat, distribution, and phenology, and relevant taxonomic notes are provided. The landscape in which E.\\xa0reddyi occurs was evaluated for the rate of deforestation and land cover changes to understand the anthropogenic impacts on ecosystem of the described species. Based on these data, the conservation status of the species was assessed.Forest ecosystems sustain biota on the earth as they are habitat to diverse biotic species, arrests soil erosion, play a crucial role in water cycle, sequester carbon, and helps in mitigating the impacts of global warming. Large scale land use land cover (LULC) change leading to deforestation is one of the drivers of global climate changes and alteration of biogeochemical cycles with significant consequences in ecosystem services and biodiversity. This has necessitated the investigation of LULC by mapping, monitoring and modelling spatio-temporal patterns and evaluating these in the context of human-environment interactions. The current work investigates LULC changes with temperature dynamics of select protected areas in Western Ghats. The land use analyses reveal changes in the forest cover across Kudremukh National Park (KNP), Rajiv Gandhi Tiger Reserve (RTR), Bandipur Tiger Reserve (BTR). KNP region has lost evergreen forest cover during 1973–2016 from 33.46 to 27.22%, while BTR lost deciduous cover from 61.69 to 47.3% due to mining, horticulture plantations, human habitations, etc. The LST increase has impacted regeneration of species with the induced water stress, etc. CA-Markov modelling was used for forecasting the likely land uses in 2026 and validation was done through Kappa indices. Results highlight decline of evergreen cover in KNP (9%) and deciduous cover in RTR (2%) followed by BTR (3%) with further expansion of plantations, which will impact biodiversity, hydrology and ecology. Insights of LULC dynamics help natural resource managers in evolving appropriate strategies to ensure conservation of threatened biota in Western Ghats.Assessment of the pre- and post-development impacts of a watershed predisposed to erosion is an important step in planning sustainable development strategies. Erosion susceptibility of a small mountain watershed, Palar in the Western Ghats, is assessed by employing a weighted linear combination (WLC) model combined with terrain attributes. The WLC model shows that relative relief, slope, curvature, and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) significantly affect the susceptibility of the watershed to erosion, whereas the wetness index, stream power index, and drainage density have minimal effect. A comparison of the WLC model with the empirical revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model shows that zones prone to severe erosion remain the same, whereas zones prone to moderate and low erosion are significantly different. In the WLC-based erosion susceptibility model, zones prone to moderate erosion dominate the spatial distribution, whereas in the RUSLE model the low-erosion category dominates. The results of our study can be applied to natural hazards management, land development impacts, land degradation, and spatial modelling where terrain features are influential.Influenced by global concerns around climate change mitigation, reduction in carbon emissions and energy security, countries are increasingly focussing on increasing the share of renewable energy. Various national and provincial level authorities are aggressively promoting renewable energy expansion, resulting in new geographies of renewable energy. The expansion of renewable energy, particularly large-scale projects, is contingent upon access to natural resources. However, areas that have high natural resource endowment for renewable energy, often have other overlapping uses of natural resources, including livelihoods and biodiversity. And renewable energy projects located in these areas compete with these other multiple uses of natural resources, often leading to unintended consequences. This study employs ethnographic methods to analyse the case of local opposition to a 113\\u202fMW wind power project, located in the Western Ghats of India. India, an emerging economy, is the fourth largest producer of wind energy worldwide and is expanding the share of renewable energy through national as well as provincial level policies. The Western Ghats are a designated UNESCO world heritage site for their exceptional biodiversity and the wind power project conflicted with natural resource-based livelihoods of indigenous populations and threatened their subsistence agricultural practices along with posing a threat to the ecology of the landscape. As a result, local activists protested against the wind power project and this contestation was animated and influenced by a variety of public, civic and private actors and institutions across scale. This paper uses insights from political ecology and energy geography to shed light on the interaction between these multiple actors and how this interaction mediated the contestations around renewable energy. It focuses on the micropolitics of this contestation to highlight the social and political processes that underpin the transition to sustainable energy. It sheds light on local struggles and contestations around renewable energy projects in conjunction with national and global commitments and shows how contestations around renewable energy in the Global South are distinct from the largely prevalent NIMBY approaches in the developed countries. This study contributes to global debates around governing renewable energy, particularly in developing countries.The aim of the present study was to develop a protocol for in vitro propagation and genetic stability analysis of Ceropegia panchganiensis Blatter and McCann, a threatened ornamental plant of Western Ghats, India. Axillary shoots were generated from nodal explants on MS medium supplemented with different concentrations of plant growth regulators. The best frequencies of shoot multiplication (100\\xa0±\\xa00.0%), maximum numbers of shoots (13.2\\xa0±\\xa00.5) and longest shoot lengths (10.1\\xa0±\\xa00.8\\xa0cm) were obtained on MS media containing BAP (13.31\\xa0μM) and NAA (2.69\\xa0μM). Optimum callus induction response (95\\xa0±\\xa02.3%) was observed on MS medium supplemented with 2,4-D (9.05\\xa0μM). Half-strength MS medium supplemented with BAP (4.44\\xa0μM) in combination with sucrose (175\\xa0mM) produced an average of 8.2\\xa0±\\xa00.4 flower buds with 80\\xa0±\\xa02.9% flowering response. Cultures treated with BAP (17.74\\xa0μM) along with sucrose (175\\xa0mM) showed the highest percentage (85%) of microtuber formation. Microshoots rooted best (96\\xa0±\\xa01.9%) in ½MS medium supplemented with IBA (7.36\\xa0μM), produced an average of 9.3\\xa0±\\xa00.9 roots/shoot with 3.6\\xa0±\\xa00.5\\xa0cm root length. The rooted plantlets survived best (85%) in a mixture of sterile soil, sand and coco peat (1:2:1). The molecular status/genetic stability of micropropagated plants was assessed by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers. A total of 1149 bands were generated with 10 RAPD and 10 ISSR primers in a mother plant and 10 micropropagated plants, out of which 1134 (98.69%) bands were monomorphic and rest 15 (1.31%) were polymorphic. The present study has established the rapid micropropagation protocol for the first time and will be of great use in conservation of C. panchganiensis with low risk of genetic instability.Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model coupled with transport limited sediment delivery (TLSD) function was used to predict the longtime average annual soil loss, and to identify the critical erosion-/deposition-prone areas in a tropical mountain river basin, viz., Muthirapuzha River Basin (MRB;\\xa0area\\xa0=\\xa0271.75\\xa0km2), in the southern Western Ghats, India. Mean gross soil erosion in MRB is 14.36\\xa0t\\xa0ha−1\\xa0yr−1, whereas mean net soil erosion (i.e., gross erosion–deposition) is only 3.60\\xa0t\\xa0ha−1\\xa0yr−1 (i.e., roughly 25% of the gross erosion). Majority of the basin area (∼86%) experiences only slight erosion (<5\\xa0t\\xa0ha−1\\xa0yr−1), and nearly 3% of the area functions as depositional environment for the eroded sediments (e.g., the terraces of stream reaches, the gentle plains as well as the foot slopes of the plateau scarps and the terrain with concordant summits). Although mean gross soil erosion rates in the natural vegetation belts are relatively higher, compared to agriculture, settlement/built-up areas and tea plantation, the sediment transport efficiency in agricultural areas and tea plantation is significantly high, reflecting the role of human activities on accelerated soil erosion. In MRB, on a mean basis, 0.42\\xa0t of soil organic carbon (SOC) content is being eroded per hectare annually, and SOC loss from the 4th order sub-basins shows considerable differences, mainly due to the spatial variability in the gross soil erosion rates among the sub-basins. The quantitative results, on soil erosion and deposition, modelled using RUSLE and TLSD, are expected to be beneficial while formulating comprehensive land management strategies for reducing the extent of soil degradation in tropical mountain river basins.Soil erosion and deposition in a tropical mountainous river basin, viz., Pambar River Basin (PRB), in a rain shadow region of the southern Western Ghats (India) were modelled using Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and transport limited sediment delivery (TLSD) function in GIS. Mean gross soil erosion in the basin is 11.70\\u202ft\\u202fha−1 yr−1, and is comparable with the results of previous soil erosion studies from the region. However, mean net soil erosion from the basin is 2.92\\u202ft\\u202fha−1 yr−1 only, which is roughly 25% of the gross soil erosion. Although natural vegetation belts show relatively higher gross- and net-soil erosion rates (mainly due to high LS and C factors), their sediment transport efficiency is remarkably less, compared to the land use/ land cover types with anthropogenic signatures (i.e., plantations and croplands). Despite the lesser amount of annual rainfall, the high rates of soil loss from the semi-arid areas of the basin might be the result of the poor protective vegetation cover as well as isolated high intensity rainfall events. The study highlights the significance of climate-specific plans for soil erosion management and conservation of the soil resources of the basins developed in rain shadow regions.Understanding habitat preference of a species of conservation significance is essential for planning effective conservation measures. The habitat structure of three sympatric otter species, viz. the smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata), the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) and the Asian small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinereus) was examined in five Protected Areas (PA) of the southern Western Ghats, India. Data on habitat structure and otter signs were collected in each one-km section of 28 different streams and rivers. Mean values of eight habitat variables were used to define habitat characteristics. Components extracted in PCA from these eight variables were used for preparing a three dimensional ordination plot overlaid with otter occurrence. The results indicated that the otters differed in their habitat use. The Asian small-clawed otter used narrow streams at higher-elevation regions (>\\xa0950\\xa0m) of southern Western Ghats, whereas the Eurasian otter mostly used small rivers in a wider elevation range between 450 and 950\\xa0m. The smooth-coated otter was mostly confined to large rivers, lakes and reservoirs at a lower elevation between 200 and 700\\xa0m. The Asian small-clawed otter preferred habitats characterized by high-elevation, narrow streams with tall and dense shoreline herb cover. In contrast, the other two species used markedly different habitat types including middle and low elevation, slow-flowing rivers which were comparatively wider than the ones preferred by the Asian small-clawed otter and with tall trees and dense canopy. The persistence of otters in India is threatened due to anthropogenic pressures. This study has identified priority habitats in southern Western Ghats that need concerted efforts to conserve the dwindling otter populations.Natural resources are experiencing unprecedented pressures due to land use and land cover (LULC) changes. Such changes in LULC have significantly affected the extent and condition of forests in the Eastern Ghats of India causing a decline in the forest cover as well as disturbing the habitats of several rare, endangered, threatened (RET) and endemic species. The current study attempts to determine the habitat suitability and threat of a selected group of plants viz, RET and endemic species. This is realized in light of LULC change and forest fragmentation over a period of ∼100 years to understand the possible conservation strategies in the study area. Historical maps and satellite images from 1920 to 2015 were used to develop the LULC and fragmentation maps. MaxEnt species distribution model were used to simulate the distribution of RET and endemic species. Our study reveals that, by and large, the Eastern Ghats have lost 15.83% of its forest area over a span of ∼100 years. For the study period from 1920 to 2015, it is estimated that about 7.92% of forest area was converted into agriculture, and up to 3.80% into scrub/grassland respectively. Also, it was found that the total number of forest patches have been increased from 1509 in 1920–9457 in 2015, core area has declined from 93461.05\\xa0sq.km in 1920–61262.11\\xa0sq.km in 2015, and edge length has increased to 2.20\\xa0sq.km in 2015 as compared to 0.82\\xa0sq.km in 1920. Best suitable habitats of RET and endemic species have reduced by 0.08% and 0.22% respectively. Habitat reduction has mainly occurred in the districts of Gajapati (Odisha state), Mahbubnagar (Telangana state) and also in Nallamalai and Kolli hill ranges. The species mostly spread across and the suitable habitats was found outside the rages of protected areas. From the present study we recommend that appropriate conservation strategies should be initiated on these threatened areas to prevent further decline in the extent and habitat quality of the RET and endemic species in Eastern Ghats.This paper presents a study of phytoliths (opal silica bodies from plants) from sediment sequences obtained from two tropical forest patches in the Western Ghats of India: a sacred grove (sequence covers last 550\\xa0cal BP) and a forest patch in a plantation (sequence covers last 7500\\xa0cal BP). The sites are located at mid-elevation (c. 650–1400\\xa0m above sea level) in a mosaic landscape showing anthropogenic open habitats and plantations as well as some evergreen forests. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the landscape composition of grassland and forest over time in the region, grassland being invariably shaped by anthropogenic activities, particularly fire for cultivation. We identified and classified phytoliths into 34 morphotypes from five taxonomic groups: Poaceae (grasses), Cyperaceae (sedges), Arecaceae (palms), Pteridopsida (ferns) and woody dicotyledons (broad-leaved trees and shrubs). We also calculated the humidity–aridity index (Iph). First, our results show that grasses are the most represented phytolith types in both sites, followed by broad-leaved trees and shrubs, palms, sedges, and ferns. Second, the highly variable climatic index Iph over the last 1000 years suggest that changes in phytolith percentage (e.g. broad-leaved trees) might be caused by human agro-pastoral activities, such as clearing through fires and irrigation. Prior to these human activities, the phytolith signal for early Holocene climate is congruent with the existing literature. Finally, this study compares new phytolith results with previous pollen data from the same sites. We find good agreement between these two botanical proxies throughout, thus validating our findings. We provide important evidence regarding the history of environmental change due to anthropogenic activities in the Western Ghats. This has important implications because it provides insights into how tropical forest will respond to increased intensity of human activities.The negative impact of anthropogenic activity on tropical forests is well documented, but the underlying factors, including socioeconomic conditions, government policy, and agricultural practices, that influence forest degradation in developing countries are poorly understood. For centuries, Soppinabetta forests (SBFs) in the Western Ghats of India have provided essential habitat for wildlife and vital organic resources (leaf litter, green foliage) for the cultivation of betel nut palms (Areca catechu) and rice paddy (Oryza sativa). Historically, betel nut farmers carefully managed resource extraction in SBFs, but recent changes in land use policy allow for unmitigated resource extraction by site dwellers, which may imperil the traditional sustainable management of SBFs. Site dwellers live on government allotted sites and primarily derive their income through the sale of forest-based products. We used SBFs as a model system to investigate the factors governing: (i) forest resource extraction, (ii) the effect of changing agricultural practices on the rate of resource extraction, and (iii) farmers’ perception of SBFs conservation in response to changes in governmental land use policy. Results from surveys of 90 households (57 farmers and 33 site-dwellers) and the forest department indicate individual farmers collected an average of 31.09 (range 0–125)\\xa0metric\\xa0tons of leaf litter and 19.11\\xa0metric\\xa0tons (range 0–120) of green foliage per year. Organic resource harvesting by farmers was positively correlated with the size of betel nut plantations, size of SBFs, and number of livestock owned per household. Betel nut plantations require six times more compost than food grains cultivated in field paddies. In past one decade, 33% of field paddies have been converted into betel nut plantations, increasing the strain on SBFs for forest resources. Farmers believe that when they lose provisional ownership of SBFs, site dwellers unsustainably harvest resources and severely damage SBFs. We suggest that an inclusive, local-level, farmer-driven protection be implemented to preserve the SBF heritage system of Western Ghats.The present study was aimed to explore the traditional knowledge of Irula tribal people who are practicing herbal medicine in Walayar valley, the Southern Western Ghats, India. A total number of 146 species of plants distributed in 122 genera belonging to 58 families were identified as commonly used ethnomedicinal plants by them. Interestingly, 26 new claims were also made in the present study. Through the data obtained from Irula tribal healers, the herbs were mostly used for medicine (40.4%) followed by trees (26.7%) and climbers (18.5%). In addition leaves were highly used for medicinal purposes, collected from 55 species (38%) followed by multiple parts from 18 species (12%). Acorus calamus is the species of higher use value (1.80) assessed to be prescribed most commonly for the treatment of cough. High informant consensus factor (1.0) obtained for insecticidal uses and cooling agent indicates that the usage of Canarium strictum and Melia dubia, and Mimosa pudica and Sesamum indicum respectively for that purposes had obtained high degree of agreement among the healers in using these species for the respective purposes. The most commonly used method of preparation was decoction (63%) followed by raw form (23%), paste (12%) and powder (2%). Therefore, it is suggested to take-up pharmacological and phytochemical studies to evaluate the species to confirm the traditional knowledge of Irulas on medicinal plants.Increasing anthropogenic pressures on forests, especially in the tropical regions of the world, have restricted several large mammalian species such as the Asian elephant to fragmented habitats within human-dominated landscapes. In this study, we assessed the effects of an anthropogenic landscape and its associated conflict with humans on the physiological stress responses displayed by Asian elephants in the Anamalai Hills of the Western Ghats mountains in south India. We have quantified faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations in focal individual elephants within and across herds, inhabiting both anthropogenic and natural habitats, and evaluated their physiological responses to different socio-ecological situations between November 2013 and April 2014. Physiological stress responses varied significantly among the tested elephant age- and sex categories but not across different types of social organisation. Adults generally showed higher FGM concentrations, even in the absence of stressors, than did any other age category. Males also appeared to have higher stress responses than did females. Although there was no significant variation in mean stress levels between elephants on the plateau in the absence of human interactions and those in adjacent, relatively undisturbed forest habitats, FGM concentrations increased significantly for adult and subadult individuals as well as for calves following drives, during which elephants were driven off aggressively by people. Our study emphasises the general importance of understanding individual variation in physiology and behaviour within a population of a seriously threatened mammalian species, the Asian elephant, and specifically highlights the need for long-term monitoring of the stress physiology and behavioural responses of individual elephants across both human-dominated and natural landscapes. Such studies would not only provide comprehensive insights into the adaptive biology of elephants in changing ecological regimes but also aid in the development of effective management and conservation strategies for endangered populations of the species.We studied the habitat preferences and burrow characteristics of trapdoor spiders, Idiops joida Gupta et\\xa0al 2013, within Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary and nearby reserve forests of Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka, Western Ghats, India, from January 2010 to April 2010. We sampled 293 plots using 5\\xa0m2 quadrats, randomly placed in six habitat types at four localities. Spiders showed patchy distribution throughout the study area. The density of I.\\xa0joida was highest in uncanopied habitats having sparse vegetation or bare grounds. Steep slopes were strongly preferred by spiders. Burrow characteristics of I.\\xa0joida, such as burrow diameter, depth, and lid thickness, were independent of habitat type.Sacred forest groves in the Western Ghats of India are small fragments of tropical forest that have received protection due to religious beliefs and cultural practices. These forest fragments are an example of community-based conservation and they serve as refugia for many forest-dwelling species in otherwise highly anthropogenic tropical forest-agriculture landscapes of the Indian Western Ghats. Many of these sacred forest groves are considered ancient woodlands, but there is very little information on their origins. For instance: How old are these sacred groves? Are they relics of forest that was once continuous or are they patches of regenerated vegetation? How do changes in the surrounding landscape influence the vegetation in these groves? Based on palaeoecological reconstruction in two such sacred forest groves, we determined the age of these forest fragments. Both reconstructions indicate transition from non-forest open landscape to tree-covered landscape at these sites. These finding from two sacred groves challenge the common perception that sacred forest groves are remnants of once-continuous forest; instead, some sacred groves such as those studied might be regenerated forest patches that are approximately 400\\xa0years old. This further raises a number of questions about the drivers of reforestation in these groves. What were the social and cultural circumstances which led to the recovery of forest within these patches? How did land tenure influence forest recovery? What role did religious beliefs play in forest restoration? Using Wallace’s (1956) framework of ‘cultural revitalization’ and based on historical literature and palaeoecological analysis of the two sacred groves, this paper examines the drivers of reforestation in the Western Ghats of India. It suggests various social, ecological and economic drivers of such revitalization, recognizing strong linkages between the ‘social’ and the ‘ecological’ within the social–ecological system of sacred forest groves. This example of reforestation suggests that contemporary restoration of forests needs to operate at a landscape scale and look at restoration as a social–ecological intervention in forest management.Large terrestrial wild herbivores are threatened globally, but scarce information exists on their populations outside of protected areas in South and Southeast Asia. India supports 39 species of wild herbivores, nearly two-thirds of which are threatened. While the protected area network still forms the backbone of large mammal conservation, it occupies less than 5% of India. Yet, remnant habitats outside of parks have received sparse attention to conserve threatened wild herbivores. Our study examined the effects of livestock occurrence, human proximity (distance to nearest village), and habitat factors (percentage habitat available and mean slope) on populations of large wild ungulates in a tropical forest outside of protected areas in the Western Ghats of India. We used a sign-based abundance-occupancy modelling approach to assess the effects of these variables on animal group density (λˆ) and animal group-specific detection probability (r) of three large wild ungulates (gaur Bos gaurus, sambar Rusa unicolor, and wild pig Sus scrofa). Our results reveal that in human-dominated tropical forests, gaur group density increases with larger available habitat and lower occurrence of livestock, while sambar group density increases with higher mean slope and lower occurrence of livestock. Contrary to expectation, sambar group density was higher in smaller available habitat. No variable could reliably explain wild pig group density, but the species is a known generalist. Our results have important implications for conservation of threatened large herbivores and management of remnant tropical forest habitats outside protected areas, especially Reserved Forests in the Indian context. Remnant habitats can support significant populations of large herbivores and need to be protected in developing South and Southeast Asian countries. Gradual improvement in livestock management practices will benefit large herbivore populations in priority regions outside of protected parks in India.IntroductionTraditional medicine plays an important role in the primary healthcare of people residing in forest areas and selling raw herbal products provides livelihood opportunities. In view of this, an extensive survey was undertaken among local people and herbalists in Sathyamangalam forests of Western Ghats, India in order to conduct a quantitative analysis of traditional knowledge about herbal medicines practiced along with their market potential.MethodsData associated with the information collected from ethnic people were analysed using the frequency of citations. During the survey period, 45 informants were identified who had much knowledge on practicing herbal medicines.ResultsA total of 78 plants representing 41 families and 68 genera were recorded to treat 40 types of ailments. Of these 64 species were sold by traders, local people and herbalists in herbal markets. Also 71 species of documented plants were included in the list of traded Indian plants.ConclusionOur study exhibited the importance of plant sources to human welfare which can serve as a key for discovery of potential new drugs. Through the results of our explorative field survey and previous reports, Andrographis alata, Aristolochia bracteolata, Aristolochia tagala, Bulbophylum fuscopurpureum, Canarium strictum, Cinnamomum tamala, Curculigo orchioides, Ipomoea obscura, Mucuna pruriens, Pandanus odoardii and Tylophora asthmatica were investigated pharmacologically, as these plants were frequently used by studied ethnic people. So we suggest that there is a need for more future scientific research on these plants to determine their efficacy and safety based on their associated ethnomedicinal uses documented in the present study.Market-based instruments (MBIs) have proliferated to address environmental degradation outside Protected Areas (PAs). Coffee plantations have been one of the most active spaces for MBIs through third-party certifications. In the certification context, the logic of extrinsic motivators is explicitly used to incentivise coffee growers in the short-term to adopt environmentally sustainable and socially responsible production, including maintaining native tree species on plantations. Coffee growers that qualify with the environmental and social standards are audited, certified and eligible to the incentive. However, there is little empirical evidence on what encourages people to adopt and maintain an ecologically compatible lifestyle. This paper attempts to question the assumption regarding the importance of extrinsic catalysts as a motivation for changes in land management strategies. We test this hypothesis in the Indian context, where the history of direct payments for conservation has been very limited. Our work finally ask the question: have conservation programmes that use direct payments ignored intrinsic motivations in their programme design? The empirical findings presented in this paper contribute to a better understanding of the range of psychological, behavioral and social factors that drive these land-use and land management decisions and explicitly engage with debates on crowding-in and crowding-out in conservation.Tropical forests are among the largest terrestrial reservoirs of carbon, and play an important role in regulating global climate. However, as a result of historic and ongoing deforestation, carbon storage in this biome is increasingly dependent on forests that are fragmented and used by humans, with considerable uncertainty about how such disturbance alters carbon storage potential and cycling. Here, we evaluate differences in above-ground carbon stocks between fragmented and contiguous evergreen forests in the central Western Ghats, India. We also assess differences in the structure, tree allometry and functional composition of forest stands between contiguous and fragmented forests, and explore how these differences influence carbon storage in fragmented forests. Relatively large, well-protected forest fragments currently store 40% less carbon per hectare above ground than contiguous forests. These differences in carbon are related to (i) lower tree density and basal area in fragments, (ii) lower average stand height in fragments, and (iii) compositional shifts favoring species with lower wood densities. Reduced stand height in fragments was associated with intra-specific variation in tree allometry, with trees in fragments being relatively shorter at any given diameter than conspecifics in contiguous forests. Further, the relatively skewed distribution of carbon storage within a few large trees in current-day fragments is added cause for concern: carbon stocks in fragments are likely to decline further in the future, following the eventual death of large trees. Active management and restoration to mitigate ecologically driven changes in habitat structure and species composition might be as important as improved management of resource use and protection from exploitation in order to sustain carbon storage ecosystem services provided by these tropical forest fragments.ObjectiveTo isolate the actinomycetes from Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu with its antimicrobial properties.MethodsStarch casein agar medium supplemented with actidione and nalidixic acid was used to isolate actinomycetes from Western Ghates region of Kanyakumari, Thirunelveli, Dindigul and Nilgiri districts. Modified nutrient medium was used as the base for screening actinomycetes against pathogenic Gram positive, Gram negative and filamentous fungi.ResultsAmong 367 actinomycetes; 17.71% showed activity against both bacteria and fungi. The highest antibacterial activity was observed against B. subtilis, 140 isolates (38.1%), S. aureus 128 (34.9%); S. epidermidis 123 (33.5%); P. aeruginosa 105 (28.6%); K. pneumoniae 88 (24%); Xanthomonas sp 62 (16.9%). Less number of actinomycetes showed activity against Erwinia, S. typhi, V. fischeri and P. vulgaris. Hundred and three isolates showed activity against B. cinerea and A. niger. Twenty five isolates revealed activity against T. simii.ConclusionsPresent investigation concludes that Western Ghats region of Tamil Nadu is the potential place for actinomycetes diversity. Further studying about these medically important strains from this region can be useful in identification of valuable bio-molecules.A critical handicap to tropical biodiversity conservation efforts in agroecosystems is the unknowns regarding the influence of landscape-scale factors on the persistence of species. To address these uncertainties, we explored two essential landscape-scale questions, within India’s biologically-rich Western Ghats, examining two nearby human-dominated landscapes that dramatically differed in their pattern of land cover. First, how does the proximity of intact forest patches affect bird community composition within agricultural landscapes? Second, can simple remote sensing-derived measures (brightness, wetness, and NDVI) be used to estimate native bird species composition within those landscapes? In both landscapes, as distance to intact forest decreased, the similarity in bird community composition between agricultural areas and intact forest increased. This suggests that the retention of tropical forest bird communities within human-dominated landscapes critically depends on the maintenance of nearby intact forest. In an answer to the second question, the remote sensing measures correlated with forest-affiliated avian species richness in only one of the two landscapes, reflecting an ecological difference between the two in the response of forest bird species to local agricultural conditions. In the landscape where a correlation was found, there was high variation in vegetative structure, which strongly impacted both the remote sensing measures and forest bird species richness. In the other landscape, forest species richness strongly correlated with changes in tree species composition in the agriculture, a factor that could not be detected by the remote sensing metrics. In order to successfully conserve biodiversity in tropical agricultural landscapes, our findings show that it is essential to conserve intact forest within those landscapes and to understand the effect of local agricultural practices on species.Seven sampling sites in each of three biomes (Western Ghats, foothills of Western Ghats and west coast) of south-western India were investigated to study the distribution, abundance and ecology of pill millipedes (Arthrosphaera)and associated fauna in relation to edaphic features. Abundance and biomass of Arthrosphaera and other millipedes were the highest in Western Ghats, while earthworms were in foothills. Arthrosphaera magna and Arthrosphaera spp. were common in Western Ghats and foothills respectively, while no Arthrosphaera were found in the west coast. None of the sampling sites consisted of more than one species of Arthrosphaera. Biomass of Arthrosphaera, other millipedes and earthworms significantly differed in Western Ghats (P =9.48 × 10−7) and foothills (P =1.35 × 10−8), as did the biomass of species of Arthrosphaera (P =2.76 × 10−7) between Western Ghats and foothills. Correlation analysis revealed that biomass of Arthrosphaera was significantly (P =0.01, r =0.45) correlated with soil organic carbon rather than other edaphic features (pH, phosphate, calcium and magnesium). Distribution pattern, abundance, biomass and ecology of Arthrosphaera of Western Ghats in relation to soil qualities were compared with millipedes of other regions of the world.Preventing and mitigating human–wildlife conflicts are a top conservation priority, particularly in India where wildlife and high densities of people co-occur. We surveyed 1972 households from 1371 villages in a 7449-km2 area surrounding five reserves in the Western Ghats. Our observational study modeled self-reported crop and livestock loss and compensation access by households. Crop loss was reported by 64% of households and associated with growing cotton, sugarcane, coffee and rice. Livestock loss was reported by 15% of households, and associated with grazing animals inside reserves. Losses incurred by households varied across reserves, averaging INR Rs 23,010 for crop loss and Rs 5423 for livestock loss. Compensation receipt was reported by 31% of households, and associated with reporting loss to authorities and elephant related incidents. Overall, landscape estimated probability of crop loss was 0.91, livestock loss was 0.19 and compensation was 0.29. Common mitigation measures for crop protection were night watching (46%), fencing (34%) and scare devices (34%); and for livestock protection were closer watch on animals (7%), guard animals (3%) and fencing (2%). Among 13 reported mitigation measures, no individual measure appeared to be associated with lowering crop or livestock loss. Unexpectedly, reported losses were similar across all reserves with higher losses incurred by households closer to the reserves. We identified conflict hot spots and influential factors across five reserves to improve current management efforts directed at conflict prevention and mitigation, and this approach is extendable to other human-dominated wildlife rich landscapes.Musa acuminata, one of the wild progenitors contributing ‘A’ genome to the present day dessert bananas, has a long evolutionary history intervened by human activities. This underexplored species is considered to be a valuable source of both biotic and abiotic stress resistance. However habitat destruction has resulted in the decline of this genetic resource. The present work deals with the seed germination studies and zygotic embryo cryopreservation of M. acuminata subsp. burmannica collected from southern Western Ghats of Kerala. Current study was conducted to access the viability of Musa seeds both in vivo and in vitro under various conditions. The experiments were carried out on seeds at different moisture conditions. Seeds were subjected to physical treatment (removal of operculum) before sawing. Different natural (soil (100%), sand (100%) and soil: sand (50:50%) mixtures) and synthetic media (Murashige and Skoog) fortified with plant growth regulators (indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (0.2, 0.5, 1.0\\xa0mg/l) and 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0\\xa0mg/l)) were tried to achieve optimum growth. Sucrose preculture (6%) for 4\\xa0h, 8\\xa0h & 12\\xa0h and air dehydration (for 1, 2, 3 & 4\\xa0h) technique was carried out for developing cryopreservation protocol for long term conservation. Under in vitro conditions, 88.5% germination was observed compared to uneven germination under in vivo conditions. Best growth was achieved in MS medium supplemented with 0.8\\xa0mg/l BAP. Seeds desiccated to moisture content 13% exhibited higher germination percentage than fresh seeds in both in vivo and in vitro conditions. Zygotic embryos with moisture content 13% could be successfully recovered after cryostorage. Better regeneration was observed among embryos precultured in 6% sucrose for 8\\xa0h.Invasions by exotic plants threaten the biodiversity and integrity of Protected Areas (PAs) by manipulating the species composition, the nutrient cycling and the hydrology prevailing in the specific habitat. Invasion of plant species in the natural ecosystem especially in the precincts of Western Ghats is due to rampant anthropogenic pressures. Complete assessment of the vegetation, richness distribution of Invasive Alien Species (IAS) and their association with the environmental drivers is essential to manage the PAs effectively. The present study analyses the richness of native vegetation with a comparative view on the distribution of Lantana camara, Chromolena odorata and Pteridium aquilinum in proposed Palani Hill National Park (PHNP), Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu. Secondly prepare models of the distribution of the target invasive species in the region. The biotic and abiotic data along with the vegetation type were generated and overlaid on IAS distribution to model the spread of target plant species. The study revealed that the distribution of invasive species negative relationship between the native species richness and positive relationship between the species dominance. Among the forest types dry evergreen, moist deciduous and tree savanna were found to be more vulnerable to invasion of Lantana camara and Chromolena odorata, wherein tree savanna and plantation were more vulnerable to invasion of Pteridium aquilinum. The information will strongly support effective management of Protected Areas.Ethnopharmacological relevanceNorth Central Western Ghats in India comprises rich bio-cultural diversity and is also home to varied ethnomedicinal practices. The study was taken up for documentation and analysis of traditional knowledge regarding the practice and use of plants in the treatment of bone fracture. This is an effort to preserve the vanishing wealth of traditional knowledge.Materials and methodsKey informants identified in a preliminary survey and collection of information was through semi structured, open ended interviews. The details on age, place of practice, experience of key informants and learning of practice, disease they treat and mode of diagnosis, storage and usage of plants were collected. The identity of plants and their information was confirmed through repeated guided transect walks in different seasons with the informants and focus group discussions. Identified plants were deposited at the herbaria of Regional Medical Research Centre, Belgaum.ResultsForty four key informants providing treatment for bone fracture in this region were identified. Thirty eight plant species belonging to 24 families have been documented in the present study. Highest number of species representation is found in families Euphorbiaceae and Fabaceae. The habit of the species showed that 45% of the herbal drugs were obtained from trees, followed by herbs, shrubs and climbers and majority of plants used were collected from wild (76%). The stem or stem bark (33%) was most commonly used plant part to prepare medicine. Twenty six formulations of 30 plant species were directly used in treating bone fracture, where Cissus quadrangularis has the highest use-value (0.14). Eleven plants were found to be administered for bone strengthening, pain relieving, inflammation reduction and speedy recovery and Gmelina arborea has the highest use value (0.27).ConclusionsThe results indicated the importance of traditional herbal practices in community for their health needs. Both conservational strategies and further validation studies are the need of the hour for better utilization and sustenance of the documented knowledge.To conserve biodiversity it is imperative that we understand how different species respond to land use change, and determine the scales at which habitat changes affect species\\' persistence. We used habitat suitability models (HSMs) at spatial scales from 100–4000\\xa0m to address these concerns for bats in the Western Ghats of India, a biodiversity hotspot of global importance where the habitat requirements of bats are poorly understood. We used acoustic and capture data to build fine scale HSMs for ten species (Hesperoptenus tickelli, Miniopterus fuliginosus, Miniopterus pusillus, Myotis horsfieldii, Pipistrellus ceylonicus, Megaderma spasma, Hipposideros pomona, Rhinolophus beddomei, Rhinolophus indorouxii and Rhinolophus lepidus) in a tea-dominated landscape. Small (100–500\\xa0m) scale habitat variables (e.g. percentage tea plantation cover) and distances to habitat features (e.g. distance to water) were the strongest predictors of bat occurrence, likely due to their high mobility, which enables them to exploit even small or isolated foraging areas. Most species showed a positive response to coffee plantations grown under native shade and to forest fragments, but a negative response to more heavily modified tea plantations. Two species were never recorded in tea plantations. This is the first study of bats in tea plantations globally, and the first ecological Old World bat study to combine acoustic and capture data. Our results suggest that although bats respond negatively to tea plantations, tea-dominated landscapes that also contain forest fragments and shade coffee can nevertheless support many bat species.The Kondapalli reserve forest (KRF) of the Eastern Ghats, India is subjected to severe anthropogenic interference, despite its status as reserve forest. The present research focuses on assessing the land use and land cover changes in and around KRF using temporal satellite data. It is evident from the current study that there has been a considerable decrease in the forest cover from 1990 to 2015; as seen from 2017 data, huge urban expansions and development activities were observed around KRF. This increase is linked to the growth in population, thereby consuming land available for their basic needs. To assess the rate of urban expansion around the forest, Land consumption rate and Land absorption coefficient were computed. The result of this analysis showed a rapid growth in built-up land between 1990 and 2017 while the periods between 1990 and 2015 witnessed a reduction in the forest class. Further, the study projected adverse impact of the growth of the new capital city-Amaravati on the KRF and proposed requiring suitable conservation measures with respect to its current deforestation and degradation trends.Three well-supported generalizations in conservation biology are that developing tropical countries will experience the greatest biodiversity declines in the near future, they are some of the least studied areas in the world, and in these regions especially, protection requires local community support. We assess these generalizations in an evaluation of protected areas in India. The 5% of India officially protected covers most ecoregions and protected areas have been an important reason why India has suffered no documented species extinctions in the past 70\\u202fyears. India has strong legislation favouring conservation, government investment focused on 50 Tiger Reserves, and government compensation schemes that facilitate local support, all of which brighten future prospects. However, many protected areas are too small to maintain a full complement of species, making connectivity and species use of buffer zones a crucial issue. Conservation success and challenges vary across regions according to their development status. In less developed areas, notably the biodiverse northeast Himalaya, protected areas maintaining the highest biodiversity result from locally-focused efforts by dedicated individuals. Across India, we demonstrate considerable opportunities to increase local income through ecotourism. Our evaluation confirms a lack of data, increasing threats, and the importance of local support. Research on biodiversity in buffer zones, development of long-term monitoring schemes, and assessment of cash and conservation benefits from tourism are in particular need. For policy makers, two main goals should be the development of monitoring plans for ‘eco-sensitive zones’ around protected areas, and a strong emphasis on preserving established protected areas.India is bestowed with rich diversity inter alia in natural resources, forests, water bodies, climate, people, language and crops grown. In order to sustainably manage, conserve and judicioususenatural resources, collective action bycommunity initiativeis desirable since private property rights lead to inequitable and unsustainable use. In this paper,efforts towardsconservation of natural forests through the collective action of providing social fencing reflected in the institution of sacred groves are discussed. This pertains to the village community in the Western Ghats region of Karnataka, India, committed towards stringent conservation efforts. The rituals of annual festivity called Devatehabba, (The worshiping festival of Goddess Mother Nature) as they trust are a part of the conservation efforts binding the members of the village community together for the cause of nature conservation. On the day of festivity, the village community invites relatives, friends and admirers to Devarabana (irgin forest grove maintained in the name of Mother Nature for centuries without any disturbance)for participation inworship of the Mother Nature which is called as Sacred Grove. In some villages, an icon, Idol or earthen pot structure is worshipped in the sanctum of Devarabana. The entry to the sanctum is restricted to the day of annual worship in the year. Thus, after the festival, if any person forgets hi+91-9449801215s/her belongings, the same can be found on the very festival day, next year only in the sacred grove. Members of the village community are not supposed to graze their livestock in the sacred grove.Abandoned plantations could potentially support a large number of native tree species through succession and restore the original tree community. In order to assess the ability of abandoned teak plantations to recover through regeneration, teak stands from 29 to 80 years old were sampled for seedling and sapling density, species richness and the use by large ungulates in the southern Western Ghats using 10\\xa0m circular plots. The influence of the forest-plantation edge was also studied. There was regeneration of a species-rich tree community in the understorey of abandoned teak plantations. However, regeneration was arrested, and thereby the large girth-class tree community remained species-poor. There was no significant change in the tree species richness with distance from natural forest, suggesting that the forest-plantation edge had little influence on the penetration of native tree species inside plantations. Asian elephant and Indian gaur dung densities were significantly lower in the plantations than in the forest. Indian gaur and sambar used the younger plantations intensively, and the density of their dung was negatively correlated with age of the plantation. Abandonment of mature teak stands arrested the succession of native trees. We provide evidence that abandoned teak plantations might not serve as suitable habitats for large herbivores during the dry months of the year in the region. The study highlights the need for active management of mature teak plantations inside wildlife reserves, in order to promote succession and improve the habitat for wild flora and fauna in the Western Ghats.The spatial and temporal dynamics of mosquitoes in stream pools were examined in a biosphere reserve of the Southern Western Ghats, India. The immature mosquitoes in stream pools were collected from stream substrates of bedrock pool, boulder cavity and sand puddle. The collected larvae and pupae were reared and identified. In total, 16 species from four genera of mosquitoes were collected. The mosquito species from Culex and Anopheles were predominantly occurred. The bedrock pool had the highest diversity and abundance of mosquitoes. The statistical analyses showed that the substrate specificity and the seasons were positively related to the distribution of mosquitoes rather than spatial pattern. This study described the spatial and temporal pattern of mosquitoes in stream pools of the Southern Western Ghats. This information would be helpful to National Vector borne disease control program for surveillance and control.Genetic, morphological and chemical variations of ten natural populations of Rauvolfia serpentina Benth. Ex. Kurtz. from Southern Western Ghats of India were assessed using RAPD markers reserpine content and morphological traits. An estimate of genetic diversity and differentiation between genotypes of breeding germplasm is of key importance for its improvement. Populations were collected from different geographical regions. Data obtained through three different methods were compared and the correlation among them was estimated. Statistical analysis showed significant differences for all horticultural characteristics among the accessions suggesting that selection for relevant characteristics could be possible. Variation in the content of Reserpine ranges from 0.192\\xa0g/100\\xa0g (population from Tusharagiri) to 1.312\\xa0g/100\\xa0g (population from Aryankavu). A high diversity within population and high genetic differentiation among them based on RAPDs were revealed caused both by habitat fragmentation of the low size of most populations and the low level of gene flow among them. The UPGMA dendrogram and PCA analysis based on reserpine content yielded higher separation among populations indicated specific adaptation of populations into clusters each of them including populations closed to their geographical origin. Genetic, chemical and morphological data were correlated based on Mantel test. Given the high differentiation among populations conservation strategies should take into account genetic diversity and chemical variation levels in relation to bioclimatic and geographic location of populations. Our results also indicate that RAPD approach along with horticultural analysis seemed to be best suited for assessing with high accuracy the genetic relationships among distinct R. serpentina accessions.This paper analyses the economics of biodiversity conservation in the context of a tropical forest ecosystem in the Western Ghats region of India, where coffee is the main competitor for land use. Using primary data covering a cross-section of coffee growers, the study notes that the opportunity costs of biodiversity conservation in terms of coffee benefits foregone are quite high. Even after including external costs due to wildlife damages and defensive expenditure to protect against wildlife, the NPVs and IRRs from coffee for all land holding groups were high. Including external costs, these NPVs across different land holding groups ranged between Rs 17 thousand to over Rs 106 thousand per acre at 12% discount rate, and the IRRs between 16.6% and 23%. Even if the expected benefits were to decrease by 20% and costs rise by a similar proportion, still the IRRs from coffee were quite high (19.5–20.1%). The study notes that the external costs accounted for between 7% and 15% of the total discounted costs of coffee cultivation, and smaller holdings proportionately incurred higher external costs as compared to large holdings. The study also notes high transaction costs incurred by the growers to claim compensation for wildlife damages. Notwithstanding these disincentives, the study notes that the local community had a positive attitude towards biodiversity conservation and were willing to pay in terms of spending time for participatory biodiversity conservation. Taking elephants, a keystone and threatened species in Asia and the study region, for the contingent valuation survey, the study notes that the respondents are willing to spend 25.8 humandays per household annually which works to over Rs 6003 per household per annum in terms of the income foregone. They also preferred a decentralized government institution for participatory biodiversity conservation.Together, Indian plus Seychelles caeciliid caecilian amphibians (Gymnophiona) constitute approximately 10% of the extant species of this order. A molecular phylogenetic analysis of all but one (or two) nominal species (16, in five genera) is presented based on mitochondrial (12S, 16S, cytb, cox1) and nuclear (RAG1) sequence data. Results strongly support monophyly of both Seychelles and peninsular Indian caeciliids, and their sister-group status. Within the Indian caeciliids, Indotyphlus and Gegeneophis are monophyletic sister genera. The phylogenetic position of Gegeneophis ramaswamii, Gegeneophis seshachari, and Gegeneophis carnosus are not well resolved, but all lie outside a well-supported clade of most northern Western Ghats Gegeneophis (madhavai, mhadeiensis, goaensis, danieli/nadkarnii). Most nominal species of Indian caeciliid are diagnosed by robust haplotype clades, though the systematics of G. carnosus-like forms in northern Kerala and southern Karnataka requires substantial further investigation. For the most part, Indian caeciliid species comprise narrowly distributed, allopatric taxa with low genetic diversity. Much greater geographic genetic diversity exists among populations referred to G. seshachari, such that some populations likely represent undescribed species. This, the first phylogenetic analysis of Indian caeciliids, generally provides additional support for recent increases in described species (eight since 1999), and a framework for ongoing taxonomic revision.Lagerstroemia speciosa commonly known as ‘Banaba’ is native of south–east Asia which exhibits both horticultural and therapeutic value. The anti-diabetic and anti-obese property of the tree is attributed to corosolic acid (CRA)-a pentacyclic triterpene seen predominantly in the mature leaves. Although there are studies on either chemical or genetic variation in L. speciosa from different regions, none have dealt with their association to discuss the formation of chemical diversity. For the first time, we have analyzed CRA content in 12 natural populations corresponding to 42 samples seen in the Southern Western Ghats (SWG) using chromatography techniques and genetic variation estimated using SSR markers. Significant variation in percentage distribution of CRA ranging from 0.005% to 0.868% dr.wt. was recorded wherein populations from the north SWG contain relatively more active principle (mean\\xa0=\\xa00.321%) than their counterparts in the south (mean\\xa0=\\xa00.064%). Similarly, SSR data showing relatively high rate of gene flow (Nm\\xa0=\\xa02.72) and low genetic differentiation (FST\\xa0=\\xa00.14) is indicative that populations from north are genetically more diverse than those in the south (Nm\\xa0=\\xa00.48; FST\\xa0=\\xa00.38). The scatter plot derived by Principle Component Analysis (PCA) of chemical and genetic data shows similar pattern of clustering that reveals strong association between the two sets of data. It is concluded that the observed variation in CRA content in natural populations of the species depends more on the genetic background and less on edaphic factors.The evolution of Peninsular Indian biodiversity has been a fascinating topic of research due to historical connections of this region to the ancient Gondwanaland. We investigated the phylogeny and historical biogeography of nearly all extant species of the genus Piper reported from the region to assess the biogeographical origins and test mechanisms of lineage diversification (dispersal, vicariance and in situ radiation) of this highly diverse genus of angiosperms commonly found in the understory of evergreen forests. The phylogeny of 21 species of Piper reported from Peninsular India was reconstructed for the first time, which included three new putative species from the Western Ghats. We used BEAST for the divergence time estimations (using three constraints), and ancestral range estimations were performed with the dated phylogenetic tree using BIOGEOBEARS. Divergence dating analysis revealed that the genus Piper originated during lower Cretaceous around 110\\u202fMa [95% highest posterior density (HPD): 116–105\\u202fMa] and colonized Peninsular India five times independently, from Southeast Asia starting from the Oligocene. The two major dispersals into India occurred during the periods of 27.3\\u202fMa (95% HPD: 35.8–19.9.) and 15.5\\u202fMa (95% HPD: 24.9–7.11). This was followed by rapid radiations in some lineages with subsequent back dispersals to Southeast Asia. Our study indicates that dispersals from Southeast Asia led to the arrival of Piper to Indian subcontinent following the Indo-Eurasian collision. Members of Piper have colonized and diversified within the climatically stable habitats of Peninsular India. Furthermore, the present study provides evidence for the Miocene overland dispersal of Piper species to Africa from South Asia.Colonial encounters with tropical ecosystems were primarily driven by profit-oriented management practices; witness the extensive network of timber and forestry practices that were set up across colonial India. In contrast, the colonial engagement with the montane forest-grassland mosaics of the higher reaches of the Western Ghats in southern India was marked by intensive investment in vegetation management by colonial foresters that yielded no profits. In this archival study, we trace the history of extensive vegetation transformation in this landscape from the early nineteenth to the early twentieth century. We show how the misperception that the grasslands within this mosaic must have resulted from tree felling, fire-setting and buffalo grazing by indigenous communities led colonial foresters into a century-long effort at ‘foresting’ the grasslands, primarily through large-scale planting of exotic tree species. These efforts persisted despite economic losses and ecological evidence that native tree seedlings planted in the grasslands repeatedly failed to establish. These policies continued unabated into the late twentieth century in newly independent India. Today, the once picturesque landscapes of these ancient forest-grassland mosaics are diminished by large-scale plantations of exotic species. Some of these species have become invasive and pose significant threats to the remnant natural grasslands. While this historical narrative is set in the forest-grassland mosaics of southern India, it finds striking parallels in the current day, with grasslands and savannas globally threatened by the misperception that they are ‘degraded ecosystems’ that can be ‘forested’ or converted to other ‘productive’ land uses. We suggest that this case history portends the potential fates of many of earth\\'s threatened tropical grasslands and savannas.Farmers worldwide regularly plant trees to obtain provisioning and other ecosystem services. This practice has come under scrutiny by conservationists who perceive a reduction of biodiversity due to preferential planting of exotic trees. In order to reverse this preference for exotic trees it is necessary to identify the key drivers of exotic species planting and propose alternative species of interest to farmers. We examined this question in a coffee agroforestry landscape of the Western Ghats, India, a global biodiversity hotspot. We interviewed farmers regarding tree planting behaviour, preferences and constraints, and assessed the relative performance and value of native versus exotic species. Multivariate analyses were used with six species-level characteristics and four farm-level characteristics, to reveal the most significant predictors of planting frequency.The exotic species Grevillea robusta was planted 5.4 times more often than native trees. Individual species’ planting frequencies were most strongly related to their realised economic values, which was highest for G. robusta. Native trees with greater multipurpose utility value and stature were also more likely to be planted. Farm-level characteristics related to increased planting efforts were increasing climatic dryness, increased land area with native tree tenurial rights and farm size. However, farmers with a greater proportion of land under secure tree tenure planted fewer trees.We conclude that although native trees had higher multipurpose utility and potential economic value than the exotic G. robusta, the latter is grown more often due to existing legal frameworks that restrict private ownership and realising monetary value from native species. If current laws were amended to increase the economic benefits obtained from native trees, they are likely to be planted more often by farmers. We propose that our results can help in implementation of the recent National Agroforestry Policy of India, as well as inform agroforestry policies and practice elsewhere.In this paper, we use a participatory approach, to assess the suitability of data provided by local fishers for determining the demography and harvest rates of endangered species, exploited in remotely located small-scale fisheries. We specifically focus on the Deccan Mahseer (Tor khudree) in the Western Ghats Hotspot of Peninsular India. Using catch data provided by local fishers, we assessed the dynamics of exploited populations of T. khudree from six major fishing sites having varying patterns of harvest (commercial vs. subsistence) and protection status (protected vs. non protected area). Based on annual length frequency data, growth parameters of T. khudree were worked out as L∞\\xa0=\\xa0383.25–1202.25\\xa0mm total length and K\\xa0=\\xa00.12–0.23 year−1. The length frequency data of T. khudree individuals exploited from two fishing sites indicated that a high share of the catches throughout the year, are contributed by immature size classes. The total mortality coefficient (Z) was calculated to be between 0.35 year−1 and 0.95 year−1 and the fishing mortality coefficient (F) between 0.13 year and 0.8 year. The fishing mortality rate of T. khudree in Poringal Reservoir (0.8 year) may probably be one of the highest for any species of Mahseer in India, and points to the targeted indiscriminate exploitation by local fishers. Exploitation rate (E) (0.34–0.84 year−1) was higher than the expected optimal level (0.5) at all, but one fishing sites revealing that T. khudree populations are overfished in the study region. Further, a comparison of the exploitation rate at various fishing sites revealed no significant differences between commercial and subsistence harvest, as well as inside and outside protected areas. In spite of its ‘endangered’ status, T. khudree receives no protection even in Biodiversity Hotspots like the Western Ghats, and its fishery is under threat of an imminent collapse. Management guidelines for sustainable Mahseer fishery in the region are suggested.The cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) closure study was performed to exemplify the effect of aerosol chemical composition on the CCN activity of aerosols at Mahabaleshwar, a high altitude background site in the Western Ghats, India. For this, collocated aerosol, CCN, Elemental Carbon (EC), Organic Carbon (OC), sub-micron aerosol chemical speciation for the period from 3rd June to 19th June 2015 was used. The chemical composition of non-refractory particulate matter (<1\\xa0μm) as measured by Time of Flight – Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ToF-ACSM) was dominated by organics with average concentration of 3.81\\xa0±\\xa01.6, 0.32\\xa0±\\xa00.06, 0.15\\xa0±\\xa00.02, 0.13\\xa0±\\xa00.03 and 0.95\\xa0±\\xa00.12\\xa0μg\\xa0m−3 for organics, ammonium, chloride, nitrate and sulphate, respectively. The PM1 number concentration as obtained by Wide Range Aerosol Spectrometer (WRAS) varied from 750 to 6480\\xa0cm−3. The average mass concentration of elemental carbon (EC) as measured by OC-EC analyzer was 1.16\\xa0±\\xa00.4\\xa0μg\\xa0m−3. The average CCN concentrations obtained from CCN counter (CCNC) at five super-saturations (SS\\'s) was 118\\xa0±\\xa058\\xa0cm−3 (0.1% SS), 873\\xa0±\\xa0448\\xa0cm−3 (0.31% SS), 1308\\xa0±\\xa0603\\xa0cm−3 (0.52% SS), 1610\\xa0±\\xa0838\\xa0cm−3 (0.73% SS) and 1826\\xa0±\\xa0985\\xa0cm−3 (0.94% SS). The CCN concentrations were predicted using Köhler theory on the basis of measured aerosol particle number size distribution, size independent NR-PM1 chemical composition and calculated hygroscopicity. The CCN closure study was evaluated for 3 scenarios, B-I (all soluble inorganics), B-IO (all soluble organics and inorganics) and B-IOOA (all soluble inorganic and soluble oxygenated organic aerosol, OOA). OOA component was derived from the positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of organic aerosol mass spectra. Considering the bulk composition as internal mixture, CCN closure study was underestimated by 16–39% for B-I and overestimated by 47–62% for B-IO. The CCN closure result was appreciably improved for B-IOOA where the knowledge of OOA fraction was introduced and uncertainty reduced to within 8–10%.Maintaining forest cover is important for Biodiversity Hotspots that support many endangered and endemic species but have lost much of their original forest extent. In developing countries, ongoing economic and demographic growth within Hotspots can alter rates and patterns of deforestation, making it a concern to quantify rates of forest loss and assess landscape-scale correlates of deforestation within Hotspots. Such analyses can help set baselines for future monitoring and provide landscape-scale perspectives to design conservation policy. For the Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot in India, we examined correlates of forest loss following rapid economic expansion (post-2000\\u202fCE). First, we used open-source remote-sensing data to estimate annual trends in recent forest loss (from 2000 to 2016) for the entire Hotspot. Across the entire Western Ghats, we assessed the relative importance of and interactions among demographic, administrative, and biophysical factors that predicted rates of forest loss—measured as the number of 30\\u202f×\\u202f30-m\\u202fpixels of forest lost within randomly selected 1\\u202fkm2 cells. Protected areas reduced forest loss by 30%, especially when forests were closer to roads (33%) and towns (36%). However, the advantage of protection declined by 32% when local population densities increased, implying that the difference in forest loss between protected and non-protected areas disappears at high local population densities. To check scale-dependency of spatial extent, we repeated the modelling process for two landscape subsets within Western Ghats. In contrast with results for the entire Western Ghats, both focal landscapes showed no difference in deforestation with protection status alone or its interactions with village population density and distance to towns. However, deforestation was 88% lower when forests were protected and farther from roads. Overall, our results indicate that protected areas help retain forest cover within a global Biodiversity Hotspot even with rapid development, but high human population densities and road development can reduce the benefits of protection.Large mammals face high risks of anthropogenic extinction owing to their larger body mass and associated life history traits. Recent worldwide mammal declines have highlighted the conservation importance of effective assessments of trends in distribution and abundance of species. Yet reliable data depicting the nature and extent of changes in population parameters is sparse, primarily due to logistical problems in covering large areas and difficulties in obtaining reliable information at large spatial scales, particularly over time. We used key informant surveys to generate detection histories for 18 species of large mammals (body mass\\xa0>\\xa02\\xa0kg) at two points in time (present and 30\\xa0years ago) in the Southern subregion of the Western Ghats global biodiversity hotspot. Multiple-season occupancy models were used to assess temporal trends in occupancy, detectability and vital rates of extinction and colonization for each species. Our results show significant declines in distribution for large carnivores, the Asian elephant and endemic ungulates and primates. There is a significant decline in detectability for 16 species, which suggests a decline in their abundance. These patterns of change in distribution and abundance repeat in our assessments of spatial variation in occupancy dynamics between the three contiguous forest complexes and two human-dominated landscapes into which the southern Western Ghats has been fragmented. Extinction rates are highest in the human-dominated landscapes. Declines in abundance for several species suggest the presence of extinction debts, which may soon be repaid with imminent range contractions and subsequent species extinctions unless immediate remedial conservation measures are taken. Detection/non-detection surveys of key informants used in an occupancy modeling framework provide potential for rapid conservation status assessments of multiple species across large spatial scales over time.The presence of appropriate fungal mycobiont for seedling recruitment and plant nutritional support is essential for the long-term survival of orchids in managed or restored habitats. Vanda thwaitesii Hook. f., an epiphytic orchid endemic to the Western Ghats in India and Sri Lanka, endangered due to habitat destruction, necessitates a restoration programme in order to conserve them in the native habitats. Understanding of mycorrhizal association is important for restoration and therefore a symbiotic fungus from natural seedlings of V. thwaitesii was isolated and symbiotic activity evaluated. The isolated fungus having symbiotic activity designated as ‘VT3’ is a slow growing species with cottony growth, binucleate and barrel shaped monilioid cells; typical characters of a Ceratorrhiza sp., anamorph of Ceratobasidium sp. Molecular identification through sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the ribosomal RNA gene revealed that it possesses 92% similarity with an uncultured Ceratobasidiaceae clone. V. thwaitesii seeds showed higher germination rate when inoculated with VT3. Majority of the control seeds failed to develop further after the initiation of germination. After the entry of fungus, the seed showed germination and 81% of the germinated seeds was transformed into protocorms in 30\\xa0days. Promeristem formation, first leaf development or second leaf initiation occurred in 95% of the protocorms in 60\\xa0days. The protocorms in symbiotic culture developed their second leaf (55%) and roots (19%) and only 24% remained at one leaf stage by 90\\xa0days. In 150\\xa0days, 43% of the seedlings obtained were with 2–3 leaves and 2 roots and 50% of the seedlings with 3–4 leaves and 2–3 roots. Asymbiotic seedlings co-cultured with the symbiotic fungus showed vigorous growth due to active colonization in their root cortex. The results suggest that the symbiotic fungus Ceratobasidiaceae clone VT3 isolated from V. thwaitesii seedlings is promising enough to continue efforts on restoration procedures for this endangered orchid species endemic to Southern Western Ghats region in India and Sri Lanka.Our work evaluated the anthropic effects on the landscape structure of the Lençóis Maranhenses National Park (LMNP) and its Buffer Zone, and proposed strategies for the region’s conservation. LMNP is an important protected area in Brazilian north coast which protects a unique wetland ecosystem composed of sand dunes fields and a coastal vegetation called restinga. Supervised mapping of LMNP and a surrounding buffer of 3\\u202fkm was carried out through high resolution and fine scale (1:5000) satellite images. The mapped area was subdivided in 1000\\u202fha hexagonal Analysis Units (AU) and the following landscape metrics were calculated for each one of them: cover area (CA) of each soil cover class - dune fields (CA-DUNES), water bodies (CA-WATER), dense restinga (CADENSE), scattered restinga (CA-SCATTER), grassland (CA-SANDY), mangroves (CA-MANG), anthropogenic activity (CA-ANTRO) and, secondary vegetation (CA-SECOND); Landscape Shannon Diversity Index (SHDI), and; percentage of native vegetation cover (NV−COV). Pearson correlations were performed between the CA of each class and SHDI to identify the classes most correlated to CA-ANTRO. Our results showed that anthropic classes (crops, trails, and villages) had a stronger correlation (Pearson Correlation, r ≈ 0.65) with phytophysiognomies of dense restinga, secondary vegetation and SHDI, thus indicating that the land use conversion occurs in dense restinga areas and promotes vegetation secondarization, as well as increasing fragmentation. At least, 42% of the dense restinga habitats was destroyed due to human activities. Five conservation and restoration strategies were proposed in a local scale depending on the percentage of native vegetation cover on each AU, from the most to less conserved: (a) only conservation; (b) conservation with management; (c) management; (d) management and restoration; and, (e) restoration. The implementation of Agroforestry Systems with agro-successional restoration goals was recommended as an alternative for land use.Over the last century, numbers of wild tigers (Panthera tigris) have crashed, while human populations have boomed. Here we investigate future trajectories of human population within tiger range through analysis of the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). These five pathways describe urban, rural and total population distributions by decade through 2100, based on plausible but contrasting scenarios of economic, education, migration, and urbanization policy. In 2010 approximately 57 million people lived in regions defined as “tiger conservation landscapes” (or TCLs); 8% of sympatric people lived in towns and cities that occupied 4% of tiger range. We show that tigers could share these same geographies with as few as 40 million (30% decline compared to 2010) or as many as 106 million people (an increase of 85%) by 2100. Those populations could be as much as 64%, or as little as 17%, urbanized, depending on the pathway. Urban areas are likely to expand, displacing between 6 and 22% of tiger\\'s current range, depending on how urban growth is managed. Human population density thresholds compatible with tigers vary by region, from 140\\u202fpersons/km2 in the Indian subcontinent, to 10\\u202fpersons/km2 in the Russian Far East and northern China. SSP3, a future where nations indulge regional rivalries, would make conservation more difficult, whereas SSP1, with a focus on well-managed urbanization and education, could help relieve pressures. Tigers are a conservation-reliant species and will likely remain so through the 21st century, therefore we suggest coupling continued site-level protection with efforts to develop constituencies for conservation in Asia\\'s burgeoning cities.Deforestation in tropical countries has been partly attributed to the non-sustainable harvesting of forest biomass by local communities. We conducted a survey among 786 households in 31 agricultural villages adjoining the eastern boundary of the Kalakad–Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, in the southern Western Ghats to see whether household wealth, social status, literacy and distance to the forest boundary influenced resource harvesting. Fuel-wood, fodder and green leaves were the major products harvested in this agricultural region. The effect of distance from the reserve boundary differed with the product harvested and its use value. Distance was a constraint for households that harvested for domestic consumption, whereas it was not significant for households that harvested for earnings. Wealth was independent of resource interest in the forest, except for the poorer lower caste households with lower levels of literacy that sold fuel-wood to earn a living. Wealthier households harvested green leaves for fertilizing their fields, and fodder harvest was related to livestock ownership. The lower cost of forest products compared to commercially available substitutes probably fuelled extraction. Forest products contributed disproportionately to household consumption as compared with household earnings. Discouraging the harvest of forest products within protected areas might be the only viable conservation strategy.In this article I analyze the practice and politics of classifying a tiger as a ‘man-eater’ in South India to explore what doing so reveals more broadly about the relations between animal life and the kinds of human life marked as expendable by the state. I draw on Achille Mbembe\\'s theory of necropolitics in order to analyze how the Indian State attempts to manage human-wildlife relations in a contested plantation landscape of high priority for wildlife conservation. While there is a large literature theorizing wildlife and biodiversity conservation as the practice of biopolitics, I argue conservation, as both a typology of space and set of ideologically malleable practices, remains under-theorized as a form of necropolitics, the politics mediating death. I examine how the Indian State goes about reclassifying tigers from a strictly protected endangered species to killable—the process of making the ‘man-eater’—in relation to how the state both values and devalues human and non-human life as a process rooted in colonial histories of accumulation by dispossession. This article responds to calls across political ecology and political geography to better theorize the role of non-human animals as essential subjects of inquiry in political contestations. It does so through exploring the spatial contours of deadly encounter between plantation workers and tigers in the plantation-conservation necropolis.The energy dynamics in Thiashola grassland, a montane subtropical vegetation in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the Western Ghats, India is studied for a period of one year. The study revealed that the energy content in unit biomass of C3 and C4 species has not varied significantly. However, the C4 species in total due to higher net primary production, entrapped 8.5 times greater solar energy (28.82\\xa0kcal/m2/day) than that of their C3 counterparts. Of the total energy fixed, the C3 and C4 species, respectively channeled 4.07\\xa0kcal/m2/day and 13.3\\xa0kcal/m2/day to the aboveground standing live compartment. The transfer rate of energy to standing dead compartment from standing live part were 3.22\\xa0kcal/m2/day and 10.36\\xa0kcal/m2/day for C3 and C4 species, respectively and both the C3 and C4 together transferred 4.81\\xa0kcal/m2/day of energy from standing dead to litter compartment. The total dissipation of energy from the system is determined to be 4401.11\\xa0kcal/m2/yr and the surplus quantity of 38.37% of energy is accumulated in the aboveground parts of both C3 and C4 species which indicates the availability of substantial amount of energetic fodder to the wild herbivores in the Thiashola grassland.he reproductive phenology of 60 understorey species, including 27 endemic and 33 non-endemic species, was monitored at monthly intervals for 20 months in a mid-elevation wet forest in the Southern Western Ghats. Narrow endemic species constituted 55% of the total endemic species studied. Peak flowering was observed during the dry and post-monsoon seasons for the endemic species, while the non-endemic species flowered during the dry season. Fruiting peak was observed in the dry season for endemic species and during monsoon for non-endemics. The flowering and fruiting pattern in narrow and broad endemic species was uniform. The implications of the result for conservation are discussed.ObjectiveTo identify the phytoconstituents present in the fronds of Tectaria zeylanica.MethodsScreening of phytochemicals was done by using the standard methods given by Harborne.ResultsPhytochemical screening of the fronds of Tectaria zeylanica confirmed the presence of various derivatives such as phenols, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, coumarins and carbohydrates.ConclusionsThe present observations suggest a possibility to establish high yielding plantlets by in vitro culture for the production of medicinally important bioactive compounds against human pathogenic microorganisms.The responses of bats to land-use change have been extensively studied in temperate zones and the neotropics, but little is known from the palaeotropics. Effective conservation in heavily-populated palaeotropical hotspots requires a better understanding of which bats can and cannot survive in human-modified landscapes. We used catching and acoustic transects to examine bat assemblages in the Western Ghats of India, and identify the species most sensitive to agricultural change. We quantified functional diversity and trait filtering of assemblages in forest fragments, tea and coffee plantations, and along rivers in tea plantations with and without forested corridors, compared to protected forests.Functional diversity in forest fragments and shade-grown coffee was similar to that in protected forests, but was far lower in tea plantations. Trait filtering was also strongest in tea plantations. Forested river corridors in tea plantations mitigated much of the loss of functional diversity and the trait filtering seen on rivers in tea plantations without forested corridors. The bats most vulnerable to intensive agriculture were frugivorous, large, had short broad wings, or made constant frequency echolocation calls. The last three features are characteristic of forest animal-eating species that typically take large prey, often by gleaning.Ongoing conservation work to restore forest fragments and retain native trees in coffee plantations should be highly beneficial for bats in this landscape. The maintenance of a mosaic landscape with sufficient patches of forest, shade-grown coffee and riparian corridors will help to maintain landscape wide functional diversity in an area dominated by tea plantations.Climate change adaptation has become an important aspect of research and policy agendas at different scales – globally, nationally and locally. One stream of thought relates to the thematic area of barriers or challenges that adaptation faces. This article explores local adaptation trajectories and challenges in a tribal development block in south India. Through the lens of key livelihood strategies pursued in the block – namely income from development interventions, migration and on-farm strategies – it explores the challenges and factors that contribute or have contributed, to impeding successful adaptation outcomes in Attappady. The article argues that development interventions (i.e planned adaptations) have not succeeded in addressing structural causes of vulnerability; they have, however, provided an important coping mechanism. Migration is a socially and culturally differentiated phenomenon and is not a viable diversification option for the most vulnerable population segments in Attappady. Finally, it is found that recent on-farm adaptation strategies present a case of maladaptation that promote marginalisation and are ill-suited to the local ecological and cultural landscape.Saraca asoca (Roxb.) De Wilde (Caesalpiniaceae) is a highly traded IUCN red listed tree species used in Ayurvedic medicines for the treatment of various disorders, especially gynaecological problems. However, information about the genetic variations between populations and corresponding variation in specialized metabolites of S. asoca remains unclear. To address this issue, we analysed 11 populations of S. asoca with 106 accessions collected from Western Ghats of India using ISSR markers along with selected phytocompounds using RP-HPLC. Twenty primers were screened, out of which seven were selected for further analysis based on generation of clear polymorphic banding patterns. These seven ISSR primers produced 74 polymorphic loci. AMOVA showed 43% genetic variation within populations and 57% among the populations of S. asoca. To estimate the genetic relationships among S. asoca populations, UPGMA and Bayesian Models were constructed, which revealed two clusters of similar grouping patterns. However, excluding minor deviations, UPGMA and dissimilarity analysis showed close association of genotypes according to their geographical locations. Catechin (CAT), epicatechin (EPI) and gallic acid (GA) were quantified from bark and leaf samples of corresponding genotypes collected from 106 accessions. ROC plots depicted the sensitivity and specificity of the concentrations of tested phytocompounds at various cut-off points. Although, multiple logistic regression analysis predicted some association between few loci with GA, EPI and CAT, but PCA for phytochemical data failed to distinguish the populations. Overall, there were no significant trends observed to distinguish the populations based on these phytocompounds. Furthermore, the study advocates the delineate provenance regions of S. asoca genotypes/chemotype snapshots for in-situ conservation and ex-situ cultivation.From the ancient time, the Northeast part of India is rich in biodiversity because of its diverse topographic, climatic features. Different varieties of mammalian, avian, and herpetofauna are endemic to this region. Unfortunately, life of this diverse flora and fauna is in jeopardy due to serious anthropogenic pressure. Once a large number of globally important species sustained in the Barak Valley. However, with the increasing population and subsequent demand on natural resources and developing activities, many of the species are no more found in the valley. If the conservation action is not initiated, the remaining species will also vanish with time. This article highlights the distribution and conservation problems of four endangered species in the Barak Valley of Assam, India and recommended conservation tactics.Unplanned large scale developmental projects in recent times have been causing alterations in land use land cover [LULC] at spatial and temporal scales with the substantial changes in the landscape. Uttara Kannada district has the distinction of having highest forest cover in India. Forest ecosystems in the district have witnessed major transformations due to industrialization during the post-independence. Impact of developmental activities during the post-independence era, is evident from barren hill tops due to deforestation. The analysis of temporal spatial data acquired through space borne sensors highlights the decline of evergreen-semi evergreen forest cover from 67.73% (1973) to 32.08% (2013). The ad-hoc approaches adopted in the implementation of developmental projects in the ecologically sensitive regions has impaired the ecosystem services affecting the people’s livelihood. The changes in the landscape structure with LULC changes have altered the functional abilities of an ecosystem evident from lowered hydrological yield, disappearing perennial streams, higher instances of human–animal conflicts, declined ecosystem goods, etc. About 64355\\xa0Ha of forest land is diverted for various non-forestry activities during the last four decades by the government apart from encroachment of 7072\\xa0Ha of forest area for agriculture, horticulture activities, etc. Encroachment of forest land has resulted in the land degradation leading to reduced productivity. Alterations in bio-geo chemical and hydrological cycles have necessitated the restoration of native forests in the region to ensure water and food security, and livelihood of the local people. Monitoring and visualization of landscape dynamics helps in evolving appropriate management strategies. LULC dynamics analyses considering agents (developmental projects) through fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) integrated with Markov cellular automata (CA) indicate the developmental projects such as West Coast Paper Mill (WCPM) and Kaiga Nuclear Power House (KNPH) will lead to further fragmentation of forests with spurt in urbanization by 2022. This necessitates framing appropriate policy measures to sustain natural resources focusing on the landscape’s ecological, hydrological, economic and social factors.A new large species of gecko superficially resembling Hemidactylus maculatus Duméril & Bibron and its allied large Hemidactylus is described from Eastern Ghats. The new species, Hemidactylus kangerensis sp. nov. can be easily distinguished from members of the H.\\xa0maculatus complex based on the number of femoral pores, i.e. 18–21 on each side, separated medially by 4\\xa0non-pored scales. A phylogenetic analysis based on partial sequence of mitochondrial gene cytochrome b shows that the gecko is a member of the “H.\\xa0prashadi” clade and is sister to H.\\xa0maculatus, from which it differs in an uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence of 10%. The discovery of a new large gecko from Eastern Ghats advocates the need for biodiversity assessment across the neglected Eastern Ghats.The ecological integrity is widely discussed as a new concept by several ecologists and environmentalists. A consensus in this regard is yet to be derived for its definition. Human intervention for its developmental activities results in several environmental changes that enhance some species, ecosystem and ecological processes while at the same time brings irrecoverable damage to the Planet Earth. It is essential and crucial to focus research and scientific analysis and establish awareness and education to provide a means of distinguishing responses between improvements in quality of ecosystem and those of damages. The focus of this paper is to emphasize the organized urban planning at a macro level and the architectural design interventions at the micro level in Vijayawada where eco – sensitivity exists with due consideration to ecological integrity and environmental protection. The ecological dynamics of continuity indicated that hillocks of Vijayawada region are a part of Eastern Ghats. The study is to elaborate that the landscape, eco-patches and its connectivity establishes a unique corridor to strengthen ecological system and as a green corridor to Vijayawada city to fulfill the demands of the city and also to create the ecological patch connectivity to scattered Eastern Ghats especially in the Krishna-Guntur region which connects the Nallamala hills through Kondapalli hill toward Sothern side and to the Papikondalu at the northern side of Eastern Ghats. These corridors may even support environmental conservation and provides rural edge in urban context and functions as lung spaces to ease the heat island effect of urban settlement. So the explicit development controls have been derived to guide and organize at micro level so as to achieve the macro level considerations of ecological integrity.Intensification of multispecies coffee agroforests reduces shade tree diversity with implications for tropical biodiversity.We investigated how tree biodiversity and its effects on coffee production and quality changes along a gradient of intensification (from diverse multispecies to Grevillea robusta dominated shade) across 25 Coffea canephora agroforests in Kodagu, India.Intensification causes a marked reduction in tree biodiversity (Shannon’s diversity: 2.74 to 0.29). Reduced tree diversity negatively affected both coffee production and quality (in terms of bean size), and increased incidences of pest attack, the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei). These results were consistent across a broad rainfall gradient (1060\\xa0mm\\xa0yr−1 to 4370\\xa0mm\\xa0yr−1) and management systems (conventional vs. organic farming and irrigation).Our results reveal important co-benefits of multispecies agroforestry systems for biodiversity conservation and coffee production. Nonetheless, intensification provides farmers with new livelihood options and income sources. To maintain high diversity agroforests, these opportunity costs need to be accounted for in developing realistic market strategies for biodiversity conservation.Forest reserves are increasingly becoming isolated, embedded in a matrix of various kinds of human land-use. Coffee plantations form the dominant matrix around many forest reserves in the tropics. In such a situation, the species richness and abundance of animals in coffee plantations can be expected to be determined by their proximity to the forest reserve and characteristics of the local vegetation. We tested this hypothesis with data on mammals (excluding bats, murids and insectivores) collected from 15 coffee plantations around the Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary in the Western Ghats mountain ranges in India, between December 2005 and May 2006. We estimated mammal species richness and abundance from indirect evidence in belt transects and track plots, and from sightings during night surveys. We sampled the vegetation of the plantations from 36 plots of 5\\xa0m\\xa0×\\xa05\\xa0m, in each estate. Twenty-eight species of mammals were recorded from 15 plantations. The number of species recorded in individual estates ranged from 5 to 19, with an average of 11.8. Distance from the Sanctuary was the most important factor that negatively influenced species richness, and the abundance of many species. Local vegetation characteristics influenced only the abundance of some small species. Coffee plantations can be a buffer around forest reserves and improve connectivity between them. However, increasing conversion of native shade into silver oak and hunting are two issues that must be addressed if coffee plantations are to form high-quality matrix around forest reserves in the Western Ghats.Spatial information at the landscape scale is extremely important for conservation planning, especially in the case of long-ranging vertebrates. The biodiversity-rich Anamalai hill ranges in the Western Ghats of southern India hold a viable population for the long-term conservation of the Asian elephant. Through rapid but extensive field surveys we mapped elephant habitat, corridors, vegetation and land-use patterns, estimated the elephant population density and structure, and assessed elephant–human conflict across this landscape. GIS and remote sensing analyses indicate that elephants are distributed among three blocks over a total area of about 4600\\xa0km2. Approximately 92% remains contiguous because of four corridors; however, under 4000\\xa0km2 of this area may be effectively used by elephants. Nine landscape elements were identified, including five natural vegetation types, of which tropical moist deciduous forest is dominant. Population density assessed through the dung count method using line transects covering 275\\xa0km of walk across the effective elephant habitat of the landscape yielded a mean density of 1.1 (95% CI\\xa0=\\xa00.99–1.2)\\xa0elephant/km2. Population structure from direct sighting of elephants showed that adult male elephants constitute just 2.9% and adult females 42.3% of the population with the rest being sub-adults (27.4%), juveniles (16%) and calves (11.4%). Sex ratios show an increasing skew toward females from juvenile (1:1.8) to sub-adult (1:2.4) and adult (1:14.7) indicating higher mortality of sub-adult and adult males that is most likely due to historical poaching for ivory. A rapid questionnaire survey and secondary data on elephant–human conflict from forest department records reveals that villages in and around the forest divisions on the eastern side of landscape experience higher levels of elephant–human conflict than those on the western side; this seems to relate to a greater degree of habitat fragmentation and percentage farmers cultivating annual crops in the east. We provide several recommendations that could help maintain population viability and reduce elephant–human conflict of the Anamalai elephant landscape.he hydrological research has largely concentrated on two extremes – undisturbed forest cover versus cleared forest land, whereas most tropical forest areas are now a mix of secondary vegetation, and old forest interspersed with patches cleared for agriculture or other non-forest use (Bruijnzeel, 2004; Giambelluca, 2002). For this reason, research on spatiotemporal variations in the effects of a mix of primary forest, mature secondary forests and disturbed forests on stream water quality was conducted in four watersheds in the Western Ghats of peninsular India. The study indicated that every one percent decrease in the forest cover (all lands with tree cover of canopy density of 10% and above when projected vertically on the horizontal ground with minimum areal extent of one ha) increases turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS) and Escherichia coli by 8.41%, 4.17% and 3.91%, respectively as also decreases calcium hardness by 0.49%. However, when the forest cover was segregated into old forests (primary forest, mature secondary forest and undisturbed mature plantations) and, open and disturbed forests the old forests were observed to significantly improve (p\\xa0<\\xa00.05) most water quality parameters. In contrast the open and disturbed forests were observed to deteriorate the observed water quality parameters except for turbidity and TSS. The magnitudes of regression coefficients indicated that the old forests were 2.2 and 2.74 times more effective than the disturbed forests in reducing turbidity and TSS, respectively. Tradeoffs between the provisioning services and water quality improvement services of the forest were apparent.Species diversity and density of trees were assessed in four 1-ha plots (at 457–925 m in elevation) in the Eastern Ghats of the Andhra Pradesh region comprising mostly of tropical deciduous forests based on a census of all trees with girth at breast height ≥ 15cm. We compared tree community characteristics like stem density, basal area, diversity, and species composition of four plots using a tree dataset of eight belt transects (5\\xa0m\\xa0×\\xa01000\\xa0m) in the study area. A total of 2,227 individuals of 44 families, 98 genera, and 129 species were recorded. Combretaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Anacardiaceae, showed the greatest importance value index. It was noticed that the most species were contributed by Euphorbiaceae and the tree density varied from 435 ha–1 to 767 ha–1 with an average basal area of 25.82\\xa0m2/ha. Shannon–Weiner index (H\\') ranged from 3.76 to 3.96, the Simpson index ranged from 0.96 to 0.97, evenness index ranged from 0.60 to 0.78, and species richness index ranged from 10.04 to 11.24. At present the biodiversity of these forests are under threat due to the anthropogenic and upcoming mining activities. The present study will help us to understand the patterns of tree species composition and diversity in the Eastern Ghats of India.Tropical montane habitats, including the Shola Sky Islands in the Western Ghats, host several threatened taxa of which, the global distributions are restricted to these mountain-tops. The rapidly increasing human footprint and the spread of invasive alien plants have already resulted in the local extinction of several taxa. Here we examine the entire Shola Sky Islands ecosystem to estimate the extent of habitat loss and to create a baseline of land use in this rapidly changing landscape. We used LANDSAT imageries from 1973, 1995 and 2017, with 840 ground truth points across the ecosystem. We find substantial landscape modification in the large high elevation plateaus (7–60%) over the last four decades while changes are muted in the other parts. The loss of grasslands to exotic trees predominates (340\\u202fkm2, 23%) the modification of this landscape, and, continues today at a rapid pace. Contrary to popular belief, Shola Forests have been relatively stable, implying that most plantations were established on grasslands—traditionally classified as “unproductive wastelands”. Across the Protected Area (PA) network, Reserve Forests (RF), the least protected areas have faced the greatest loss of grasslands. Older PAs have lost relatively fewer grasslands, but the invasion from adjoining RFs is now increasing. We highlight the complexity of conservation in this landscape with three case studies of PAs with different management histories. Our study highlights the rapid loss of native Shola Grasslands, the continuing loss to invasive exotic trees, and the challenges of conserving this critical habitat with traditional modes of conservation.This large-scale, landscape-level study aims to assess tree species diversity, stem density and stand structure of six major tropical hill forests of southern Eastern Ghats, India, namely, Bodamalai (BM), Chitteri (CH), Kalrayan (KA), Kolli hills (KO), Pachaimalai (PM) and Shervarayan hills (SH). The Eastern Ghats of India is relatively under-studied compared with the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. The entire stretch of southern Eastern Ghats was divided into smaller grids of 6.25\\xa0km\\xa0×\\xa06.25\\xa0km, totaling to 120 grids. Within each grid, a belt transect of 0.5\\xa0ha (5\\xa0m\\xa0×\\xa01000\\xa0m) area was laid and all trees ≥30\\xa0cm girth at breast height (gbh) were enumerated. A total of 272 tree species (≥30\\xa0cm gbh) that belonged to 181 genera and 62 families were recorded in the total 60\\xa0ha area inventoried. Diversity indices such as Shannon, Simpson and Fisher\\'s alpha indices were 2.44, 0.03 and 42.1, respectively, for the whole 60\\xa0ha area. One way ANOVA revealed that the species richness varied significantly across the six sites (F(5,823)\\xa0=\\xa04.854, p\\xa0<\\xa00.0002). Also, the contribution of tree species to total species richness classified by three plant types viz. evergreen, brevi-deciduous and deciduous species varied significantly across the sites (One way ANOVA: F(2,15)\\xa0=\\xa010.05, p\\xa0<\\xa00.002). Similarity indices such as Jaccard and Sørensen showed that sites CH and KA are more similar in terms of species composition. The total stand density and basal area for the total 60\\xa0ha area were 27,412 stems (457\\xa0stems\\xa0ha−1) and 1012.12\\xa0m2 (16.9\\xa0m2\\xa0ha−1), respectively. The stand density and basal area for the six sites ranged from 290 (in site BM) to 527\\xa0stems\\xa0ha−1 (in site KA) and from 5.6 (in site BM) to 24.4\\xa0m2\\xa0ha−1 (in site KO), respectively. Stand density and basal area of tree species varied significantly across the six hill complexes (F(5,823)\\xa0=\\xa04.85, p\\xa0<\\xa00.0002 and F(5,823)\\xa0=\\xa02.71, p\\xa0<\\xa00.02, respectively). A positive correlation was obtained between stand density and species richness in sites PM (rs\\xa0=\\xa00.65, p\\xa0<\\xa00.05) and SH (rs\\xa0=\\xa00.67, p\\xa0<\\xa00.05), but not in other sites. The predominant tree species in the tropical forests of southern Eastern Ghats include Albizia amara, Euphorbia antiquorum, Canthium dicoccum var. dicoccum, Memecylon edule, Chloroxylon swietenia and Nothopegia heyneana. Taxonomically, Euphorbiaceae constituted the most diverse family with 25 species. Whereas, by tree abundance the Mimosaceae with 4126 stems enumerated from the 60\\xa0ha area formed the dominant family. Bray–Curtis cluster analysis, based on tree species composition and abundance revealed that the low-diverse site BM formed a separate entity from other hill complexes. This large-scale tree diversity inventory provides a baseline data for a variety of investigations and is expected to be useful for effective forest management and biodiversity conservation of southern Eastern Ghats region.Nilgirianthus ciliatus is of interest for its extensive applications in Ayurvedic medicine. The study focuses on the assessment of genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships in N. ciliatus populations to aid conservation of this species at risk of extinction. Thirty five inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) and thirty random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were employed in PCR yielding 298 and 99 bands, respectively. Using ISSR markers, bands of 200–3500 bp were obtained and accounted for 77.0% of polymorphism observed. The polymorphism information content (PIC) and resolving power (Rp) values were 0.59 and 20.8, respectively. RAPD analysis resulted in 99 total bands of which 89 were polymorphic (89.9%). The PIC value for RAPD was 0.61 and Rp value was 18.8. The two different cluster analyses (UPGMA and Neighbor Joining) and principal component analysis showed the genetic variation among the populations. Clustering of N. ciliatus populations from different geographical regions in distinct groups can be a good sign for clear separation that is supported by high bootstrap values. Overall, both ISSR and RAPD analyses were valuable for identifying genetic variations and phylogenetic relationships in N. ciliatus populations at the DNA level and these differences provides the basic knowledge for better conservation management policies and genetic identification of the different geographical populations of this plant.tion conflicts represent complex multilayered problems that are challenging to study. We explore the utility of theoretical, experimental, and constructivist approaches to games to help to understand and manage these challenges. We show how these approaches can help to develop theory, understand patterns in conflict, and highlight potentially effective management solutions. The choice of approach should be guided by the research question and by whether the focus is on testing hypotheses, predicting behaviour, or engaging stakeholders. Games provide an exciting opportunity to help to unravel the complexity in conflicts, while researchers need an awareness of the limitations and ethical constraints involved. Given the opportunities, this field will benefit from greater investment and development.Forest-agricultural ecotones are defined as areas that adjoin forests and other natural habitats and that lie between forests and zones of intensive agriculture. These ecotones are critical for conservation of biodiversity and for the maintenance of livelihoods of people that inhabit these areas. Here we focus on three questions: (1) How can we make land use sustainable in forest-agriculture ecotones? (2) How can forest-agriculture ecotones contribute to conservation of biodiversity? (3) How can we improve the institutions that foster sustainability and conservation of biodiversity in forest-agriculture ecotones? We address these questions in the context of interventions to foster biodiversity and rural livelihoods made by the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bangalore, in the Western Ghats and the Eastern Himalayas, 2 of the 34 global hotspots of biodiversity in India. At several sites, ATREE\\'s interventions have improved the livelihoods of several rural communities by providing increased income from non-timber forest products (NTFPs), diversification of livelihoods and enhanced agricultural production. These interventions have improved the prospects for sustainable land use in the forest-agriculture ecotones. Simultaneously, ATREE\\'s interventions have strengthened a range of village level and regional institutions that play a critical role in the rural economy and in conservation of biodiversity. We believe that the path to sustainability in agriculture as well as maintenance of biodiversity passes through adaptive, strong and relevant institutions. The development of institutions however is severely constrained by low social and human capital and the neglect of forest-agriculture ecotones by the governmental agencies and international organizations. We argue that forest-agriculture ecotones offer a means to conserve biodiversity through alleviation of poverty and development of community-based institutions.The structure, function, and ecosystem services of tropical forest depend on its species richness, diversity, dominance, and the patterns of changes in the assemblages of tree populations over time. Long-term data from permanent vegetation plots have yielded a wealth of data on the species diversity and dynamics of tree populations, but such studies have only rarely been undertaken in tropical forest landscapes that support large human populations. Thus, anthropogenic drivers and their impacts on species diversity and community structure of tropical forests are not well understood. Here we present data on species diversity, community composition, and regeneration status of tropical forests in a human-dominated landscape in the Western Ghats of southern India. Enumeration of 40 plots (50\\xa0m\\xa0×\\xa020\\xa0m) results a total of 106 species of trees, 76 species of saplings and 79 species of seedlings. Detrended Correspondence Analysis ordination of the tree populations yielded five dominant groups, along disturbance and altitudinal gradients on the first and second axes respectively. Abundant species of the area such as Albizia amara, Nothopegia racemosa and Pleiospermum alatum had relatively few individuals in recruiting size classes. Our data indicate probable replacement of rare, localized, and old-growth ‘specialists’ by disturbance-adapted generalists, if the degradation is continuing at the present scale.Kundapallam watershed is located in Nilgiris District of south India. This ungauged watershed has an areal extension of 14.37 km2. There are increasing numbers of rainfall induced landslide occurrences in this area. The causes of rainfall induced landslides require a thorough understanding of runoff characteristics of the watershed. In this respect, the runoff of the study area is estimated with two approaches such as modified Soil Conservation Curve Number (SCS-CN) and Green-Ampt loss method. By these approaches, the related thematic factors on runoff characteristics are prepared with satellite images by using ARCGIS and IDRISI image processing software. The catchment delineation is generated for the Kundapallam watershed to get watershed parameters by using HEC-GeoHMS extension in ARCGIS. Curve number is assigned based on Soil Wetness Index (SWI). Sixteen soil samples were collected from different localities for the determination of hydraulic conductivity, moisture content, wetting front capillary pressure, bulk density, porosity etc. The infiltration rate of sample locations is determined by using double ring infiltrometer. Then all the parameters are assigned to models applied in this study to determine runoff characteristics of the study area. The accuracy and goodness of fit of the model are tested by determining the correlation coefficient (SCS-CN = 0.979 and Green-Ampt = 0.985) and coefficient determination (SCS-CN = 0.958 and Green-Ampt = 0.97) and it indicates statically positive correlations and perfect fit between the results of the study. The results showed that the modified SCS-CN provides low runoff estimation compared than Green-Ampt loss method.Night frogs (Nyctibatrachidae) form a family endemic to the Western Ghats, a hill chain along the west coast of southern India. Extant members of this family are descendants of a lineage that originated on the subcontinent during its longtime isolation in the Late Cretaceous. Because the evolutionary history of Nyctibatrachidae has always been tightly connected to the subcontinent, these tropically-adapted frogs are an ideal group for studying how patterns of endemism originated and evolved during the Cenozoic in the Western Ghats. We used a combined set of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA fragments to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of 120 ingroup specimens of all known species of Nyctibatrachidae. Our analyses indicate that, although this family had an early origin on the Indian subcontinent, the early diversification of extant nyctibatrachids happened only in the Eocene. Biogeographic analyses show that dispersal across the Palghat gap and Shencottah gap was limited, which led to clade endemism within mountain ranges of the Western Ghats. It is likely that multiple biota have been affected simultaneously by these prominent geographical barriers. Our study therefore further highlights the importance of considering the Western Ghats–Sri Lanka biodiversity hotspot as an assemblage of distinct mountain regions, each containing endemism and deserving attention in future conservation planning.Economic valuation of ecosystem benefits and their aggregation in a benefit–cost analysis (BCA) framework is the norm in mainstream environmental economics. But valuation and BCA have also attracted criticisms. ‘Internal’ criticisms point to the absence of alternative scenarios in valuation, overlooking of ecological trade-offs and dis-services, and inattention to context. Others criticize aggregation across diverse stakeholders and the problem of non-monetizable benefits, and dismiss BCA as fatally flawed. They suggest approaches such as deliberative decision-making and multi-criteria analysis. We propose a middle path that uses the strengths of economic analysis for decision support while avoiding the pitfalls. We disaggregate economic impacts by stakeholder groups, link ecosystem changes to benefits as well as dis-benefits, and examine how socio-technological context shapes the magnitude of economic impact. We illustrate this approach by studying the impact of creating the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple wildlife sanctuary in the Western Ghats forests of southern India. Our analysis shows that while some stakeholders are net beneficiaries, others are net losers. Changes in forest rights, irrigation technologies, and ecosystem dynamics influence the magnitude of benefits and sometimes convert gainers into losers. Such disaggregated analysis can provide useful information for deliberative decision-making and important academic insights on how economic value is generated.We analyzed mycorrhizal types and dark septate endophyte (DSE) fungal associations in a shola vegetation of Western Ghats region, southern India. Plants belonging to 29 species of 19 families were assessed for mycorrhizal type and DSE fungal association. Five mycorrhizal classes were classified based on morphological traits: arbuscular, ecto-, ectendo-, ericoid-, and orchid mycorrhizas. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) association was the most predominant mycorrhizal type, occurring in 16 plant species, followed by orchid (3 species), ericoid- (2 species), and ecto- and ectendomycorrhizas (1 species each). Mycorrhizal association is reported for the first time in 19 plant species. DSE fungal association was found in six plant species. Arum- and Paris-type AM morphology was found, respectively, in 10 and 5 plant species, with intermediate type recorded in one species. In this study, some new records on the morphological types of AM in some plant families were obtained. Further occurrence of ectendomycorrhizas in Pinus oocarpa and dark septate fungal association in Eleaocarpus munronii, Symplocos cochinchiensis, Daphniphyllum neilgherrense, Euodia roxburghiana, Syzygium arnottianum, and Syzygium montanum are reported for the first time. Roots of Berberis tinctoria, Mahonia leschenaultii (Berberidaceae), Elaeagnus latifolia (Elaeagnaceae), and Elaeocarpus oblongus (Elaeocarpaceae) lacked any fungal structures.Knowledge of the social structure of a population is important for a range of fundamental and applied purposes. Group characteristics and population structure of chital (Axis axis) and sambar (Rusa unicolor) were studied in a deciduous habitat of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, Western Ghats, India, during 2008–2009. Vehicle transects were monitored monthly to gather information on group–size and age–sex composition of chital and sambar. The average mean group size and crowding for chital and sambar was 13.1\\xa0±\\xa00.5 (n\\xa0=\\xa01020), 3.6\\xa0±\\xa00.2 (n\\xa0=\\xa0377) and 33.3, 11.0 respectively. The average adult male:adult female:fawn ratio was 63.4:100:22.3 (n\\xa0=\\xa09391) and 43.9:100:23.7 (n\\xa0=\\xa01023) in chital and sambar respectively. The mean group size of chital and sambar varied significantly between seasons (Kruskal–Wallis test, p\\xa0=\\xa0<0.001). Peak fawning season was observed from February to May for chital and May to August for sambar. Group\\'s sex–age composition influenced group formation in both species between seasons at different level. Adult male and fawn were the important predicting variables of change in group size. Skewed female sex ratio was probably due to selective male predation by large predators. Although fawning occurred throughout the year, both species showed seasonality in fawning. The above mentioned patterns differed between species depending upon their ecological adaptation in foraging strategies and habitat preference.In the Western Ghats (South India), the natural evergreen forest has been highly disturbed and fragmented for 150 years. The resultant vegetation is a mosaic of more or less disturbed forests, pastures, and crops (mainly paddy fields). This paper aims to assess the effects of anthropic disturbance on earthworm communities. Earthworms were collected at the end of the rainy season in a wide range of milieux distinguished by their vegetation, soil properties and topography. The earthworms found belong to the families Octochaetidae, Megascolecidae and Moniligastridae. Densities ranged from 35.3 to 545.3 ind m−2. Biomasses ranged from 2.35 to 52.56 g m−2. There was no clear relationship between these community characteristics and the vegetation, soil properties or topography as pastures and forests supported high or low densities (or biomasses). Nevertheless, some species were restricted to pastures, some species to forests and some species are found in all milieux.here is comparatively limited information in the humid tropics on the surface and sub-surface permeability of: (i) forests which have been impacted by multi-decades of human occupancy and (ii) forestation of land in various states of degradation. Even less is known about the dominant stormflow pathways for these respective scenarios. We sampled field saturated hydraulic conductivity, K∗ at 23 sites at four depths (0\\xa0m, n\\xa0=\\xa0166), (0.10\\xa0m, n\\xa0=\\xa0139), 0.45–0.60\\xa0m, n\\xa0=\\xa0117, (1.35–1.50\\xa0m, n\\xa0=\\xa0117) under less disturbed forest (Forest), disturbed production forest of various local species (Degraded Forest) and tree-plantations (Acacia auriculiformes, 7–10\\xa0years old, Tectona grandis, ∼25–30\\xa0years old, Casuarina equisetifolia, 12\\xa0years old) in the Uttar Kannada district, Karnataka, India, in the Western Ghats. The sampling strategy was also undertaken across three physiographic blocks and under three main soil types. Subsequently the determined K∗ were then linked with rainfall intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) characteristics to infer the dominant stormflow pathways.The Degraded Forest shows an order of magnitude decline in K∗ at the surface as result of human impacts at decadal to century time scales. The lowest surface permeability is associated with the Degraded Forests over the Laterite (Eutric Nitosols and Acrisols) and Red soils (Eutric Nitosols) and infiltration-excess overland flow, IOF probably occurs. Further there is a progressive decline in K∗ with depth in these soils supporting Degraded Forests. The A. auriculiformes plantations over the Red and Lateritic soils are progressively restoring the near-surface K∗, but their K∗ still remain quite low when compared to the less disturbed forest permeability. Consequently these plantations still retain the ‘memory’ from the previous degraded state. In contrast the permeability of the Black soils (Vertisols) are relatively insensitive to T. grandis plantations and this soil group has a very low K∗, irrespective of land cover, so that IOF likely prevails. Overall, the Laterites are the most variable in K∗ when compared to the other soil groups. Thus when compared to other studies, IOF is probably more prevalent in this region. More especially so, when taking into account the marked reduction in surface K∗ during the wet season when compared to dry season measurements. In addition, we have demonstrated the potential for the ‘infiltration – trade-off’ hypothesis to be realized in this landscape under certain conditions of land degradation and restoration. It is most relevant to the combination of degraded sites and A. auriculiformes plantations on Red or Laterite soils using the less disturbed forests as the baseline. The intensity of forest use and effects of monoculture plantations on soil ecology (relative to native, mixed forests) is likely to be the critical factor in affecting surface K∗ over time. Predicted changes in the intensity of rain events in the future is likely to enhance overland flow on degraded sites on all soils and especially on Black soils, and restoration efforts by all stake-holders, preferably using native or non-invasive species, are needed to address this concern.The Western Ghats in India is one of the 25 global hotspots of biodiversity, and it is the hotspot with the highest human density. This study considers variations in the regional fire regime that are related to vegetation type and past human disturbances in a landscape. Using a combination of remote sensing data and GIS techniques, burnt areas were delineated in three different vegetation types and various metrics of fire size were estimated. Belt transects were enumerated to assess the vegetation characteristics and fire effects in the landscape. Temporal trends suggest increasingly short fire-return intervals in the landscape. In the tropical dry deciduous forest, the mean fire-return interval is 6 years, in the tropical dry thorn forest mean fire-return interval is 10 years, and in the tropical moist deciduous forest mean fire-return interval is 20 years. Tropical dry deciduous forests burned more frequently and had the largest number of fires in any given year as well as the single largest fire (9900\\xa0ha). Seventy percent, 56%, and 30% of the tropical moist deciduous forests, tropical dry thorn forests, and tropical dry deciduous forests, respectively have not burned during the 7-year period of study. The model of fire-return interval as a function of distance from park boundary explained 63% of the spatial variation of fire-return interval in the landscape. Forest fires had significant impacts on species diversity and regeneration in the tropical dry deciduous forests. Species diversity declined by 50% and 60% in the moderate and high frequency classes, respectively compared to the low fire frequency class. Sapling density declined by ca. 30% in both moderate and high frequency classes compared to low frequency class. In tropical moist deciduous ecosystems, there were substantial declines in species diversity, tree density, seedling and sapling densities in burned forests compared to the unburned forests. In contrast forest fires in tropical dry thorn forests had a marginal positive effect on ecosystem diversity, structure, and regeneration.The Kandivalasa River Sub Basin near Cheepurupalli town of Vizianagaram district, Andhra Pradesh, India was monitored for groundwater levels at 41 observation wells during 2013–2015. Along with groundwater levels, the daily rainfall data is also collected for these years. A continuous decrease in groundwater levels was observed during the study period more particularly in the year 2015 which also had minimum rainfall. Groundwater depletion is observed mostly in the Eastern and South Western part of the basin where pumping wells are more. Groundwater balance studies have indicated that 11.3 MCM of groundwater can be utilized in the basin annually. However, the net annual groundwater draft has been found to be 16.6 MCM. Hence, over abstraction of 5.66 MCM is the main cause for depletion of groundwater levels. The water conservation and groundwater recharge measures have to be taken up at Chinnanadipally and Dummeda villages in the basin to have sustainable groundwater utilization in the basin.Ghats have come about as a response to religious, spiritual and social needs along the water edges in India and have become places of human congregation. This study is limited to the main ghat area of the waterfront in Ujjain, a historic city and a significant Hindu spiritual center in India. The objective is to identify forces that underpin and threaten this valuable environment and propose strategies that could be implemented to salvage it. Research was conducted through detailed examination of physical aspects of the urban public realm, activity patterns and environmental conditions. Text, data and drawings were systematically collected through various sources. Key concerns are discussed in the light of current thinking on the subject to propose strategies and draw up conclusions for necessary conservation and revitalization to take place.Cane is one of the important forest products after timber, form an integral part of a rural and tribal population of many of the tropical countries of South East Asia, Africa and America. Calamus nambariensis Becc. has been recognized as endemic and threatened cane to the North East region of India. The plant is restricted to only two pockets of Assam with a poor population size. Therefore, conservation of this plant through proper scientific investigation is utmost necessary. The present investigation has as its objectives to study the distribution, estimation of population size, standardization of suitable micropropagation methods for reintroduction and reinforcement in suitable wild habitat as determined by ecological niche modelling (ENM) for the purposes of conservation. For improving the conservation status of the species, potential area and habitat for reintroduction was determined using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) distribution modelling algorithm. The population size in both the site was found to be very poor i.e., mean density, frequency of occurrence and abundance in relation to other associated species was 0.600, 29.26 and 2.307 in Nambor Reserve Forest whereas 0.526, 27.407 and 2.112 respectively in Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary. Macropropagation of C. nambariensis was standardized here through seed germination which was found to be more efficient in terms of time and cost which revealed 87% germination in treated seeds, followed by 61% only for untreated seeds till 90\\xa0days. It was also observed that seedlings in the hilly slope of Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary (reinforcement) showed high survivability than that of the hilly slop of Lahorijan Reserve Forest (reintroduction). Further, survival rate was measured for 24\\xa0months, which revealed significantly very high on an average of 97.85% in both the locations, while 1200 numbers of C. nambariensis plantlets were transferred to the field. The present study could change the population size of C. nambariensis in its natural habitat, proving effective means for preventing extinction and improving conservation status of the plant.As pressure from a growing human population increases around the world, greater levels of conflict between people and wildlife over shrinking available land may be inevitable. The conversion of Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary to Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) in India is a conservation initiative under “Project Tiger” scheme to facilitate greater habitat connectivity across the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. We interviewed local people in the MTR landscape to determine their interest and attitude towards resettlement and tiger conservation following MTR’s new status designation. We found that non-tribal Mountain Chetties generally had negative attitude towards tiger conservation, Kurumbas were positive toward the idea, and Kattunaickers, and Irula people and other minor ethnic groups were found neutral. We found that literate respondents were less likely to collect firewood and more likely to exhibit positive attitude towards tiger conservation and the establishment of MTR. Households with higher milk production, and people with generally negative attitude towards wildlife conservation, were against the declaration of MTR. People employed in private sectors and those having negative perception towards wildlife conservation were more likely to show negative attitude towards declaration of MTR. Locals desiring resettlement post MTR declaration were literate, and interested in availing better livelihood resources. However, they usually suffered relatively high livestock loss to large carnivores, and high crop damage caused by elephant (Elephas maximus). Most respondents (74.3%) were interested in resettlement provided that basic amenities were available to them. We recommend that conservation authorities facilitate “choice-based resettlement” options, which account for local people’s consent before making decisions on “resettlement”. This approach will avoid possible conflicts between forest managers and local people.The lantern flowers (genus: Ceropegia L. — Apocynaceae) are among the most fascinating group of flowering plants which comprises of over 200 species of herbs and climbers. Although most of the species have appreciable importance as a source of edible tubers, ornamental flowers and implications in folk medicine, the conventional propagation techniques limit the mass propagation and their commercialization. Plant tissue culture and other biotechnological tools proved their importance in breeding and large-scale propagation of lantern flowers. In recent past, numerous in vitro regeneration approaches for micropropagation and conservation have been established for lantern flowers. Molecular markers represent powerful tools for constructing phylogenetics, taxonomic confirmations and reconsiderations of lantern flowers. Moreover, molecular markers are routinely used for ascertaining genetic integrity among the micropropagated clones of lantern flowers. This review provides comprehensive information on the biotechnological interventions for propagation, conservation, and improvement of lantern flowers. Protocols for various in vitro regeneration approaches, genetic composition, genetic fidelity analysis and in vitro secondary metabolite production are compared and optimized results are highlighted.The endangered Nilgiri tahr Hemitragus hylocrius is endemic to the Western Ghats mountains in south India. The largest existing population inhabits the Anamalai conservation unit (Anamalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary, and Eravikulam National Park) straddling the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. We undertook a survey to assess the conservation status of Nilgiri tahr in the Anamalai-Parambikulam area of the conservation unit. Altogether, 348 tahr were sighted in 12 separate grassland areas, including two populations which had not been recorded previously. The present population of Nilgiri tahr in Anamalai and Parambikulam sanctuaries is estimated to be between 570 and 690 animals. Together with the Eravikulam population, the Anamalai conservation unit therefore contains some 1400 Nilgiri tahr. We found evidence of poaching in five of the 12 areas surveyed. Tahr habitat is also threatened by the spread of wattle Acacia mearnsii in one area, and by extensive livestock grazing in another. Comparisons are made with the successful conservation measures taken in Eravikulam and recommendations made for control of poaching in Anamalai–Parambikulam area.Earth is undergoing unprecedented urban growth, with urban areas forecasted to increase by 120\\u202fmillion\\u202fha from 2000 to 2030, impacting natural habitat. However, to date it is unclear where conservation investments can best mitigate biodiversity loss due to urban expansion into natural habitat. Here we combine spatially-explicit global forecasts of urban expansion, information on terrestrial vertebrate endemism, and data on current land cover and protected areas to define conservation priorities. Globally, 13% of endemics are in ecoregions under high threat from urban expansion. Biodiversity losses are highly spatially concentrated, with 78% of endemics threatened by urban growth occurring in just 30 priority ecoregions (4% of all ecoregions). Natural habitat protection of 4.1–8.0\\u202fmillion\\u202fha, <7% of total forecasted urban expansion, would be needed in these priority ecoregions. As an added benefit, such protection would also reduce GHG emissions by an amount worth up to 87.6 billion USD.The high altitude ferruginous Alfisols associated spatially with shrink–swell soils on the Deccan basalt plateau and dissected table lands in the Western Ghats of India were analysed for their morphological, chemical and mineralogical properties with a view to comprehend their formation and persistence in the tropical humid climate prevailing since the early Tertiary. The study indicates that despite their acidic pH the soils have high bases and their clay fractions are dominated by interstratified smectite-kaolin. The persistence of these non-kaolinitic and/or non-oxidic Alfisols has been possible due to the presence of base-rich zeolites of amygdoloidal basalt. It suggests that for an open system such as soil, the existence of steady state is a more meaningful concept than thermodynamic equilibrium. The knowledge gained on the role of zeolites in soils provides a check on the reasoning of models on the formation of soils in tropical humid climate. The study also indicates that the supply of bases from zeolites can prevent the soils from losing their productivity even in intense leaching environment.In tropical forest conservation, areas with full statutory protection are often surrounded by buffer zones. Information on the patterns of tree community structure differences in these zones is helpful to evaluate the conservation efficacy. Our study was implemented within a biodiversity hotspot, in the Ta Xua Nature Reserve of north-western Vietnam, which has a statutorily protected core zone and a buffer zone, where local H’Mong people are permitted low intensity forest use. The forests are rich in tree species (249 observed). Many of these tree species provide non-timber forest products (NTFPs) (48%) or valuable timber (22%), and 18 species are red-listed. Overall tree density was not different in the two zones, but tree diameter and species richness were lower in the buffer zone. At the tree level, logistic regression analysis indicated that red-listed status, large diameter, and low density of conspecifics increased the probability of tree absence from the buffer zone but not the potential use as a NTFP. However, most NTFP species had different densities in the core and buffer zones, and this correlated with signs of human interference. At the species level, the density of species was the most important variable, and rarity strongly increased the probability of species absence. Our results also indicate that rare and red-listed trees were depleted in the buffer zone. In consideration of conservation goals, the future monitoring of these species at the Ta Xua Nature Reserve and other protected areas is needed, and conservation measures most likely need to be improved.There is an increased interest in identifying the status of biodiversity in different spatial and temporal scales. The objective of the current research is to prepare a consistent spatial database of intact forest landscapes of India. The intact forest landscapes are located in the Himalayas, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Western Ghats and Sunderbans. At national level 237 forest landscapes and 5.4% of the total natural forest remained as intact in India. Current intact forest landscapes of India consists of blocks larger than 10\\xa0km2 covering an area of 34,061\\xa0km2. Of the total area under intact forest landscapes, Eastern Himalayas represent 76.7% of the area, followed by Western Himalayas (8.8%), Andaman & Nicobar Islands (6.2%) and Western Ghats (5.7%). The largest intact forest landscape block occupies an area of 3342.9\\xa0km2 (9.8%) is found in western Arunachal Pradesh. Temperate forest zone represents the highest intactness (56.6%), followed by subtropical zone (19.2%), tropical zone (18.6%) and alpine zone (5.6%). Himalayan moist temperate forests represent the highest area (39.1%) of intact forest landscapes followed by subtropical broad-leaved hill forests, wet evergreen forests, and montane wet temperate forests. It is estimated that 4.4% of the area of intact forest landscapes fall inside the existing 47 protected areas. The results of the analysis best suited as input for the process of identification of new protected areas. The study recommends fine-scale mapping of biodiversity within the intact forest landscapes and to prepare efficient conservation plans.Soppina Betta Forests (SBFs; foliage forests) are minor forests allowed by the State for the Areca-grower’s use as organic support in the Western Ghats area of Karnataka, South India. Sustainable utilization of these for foliage and litter (to make composted leaf-manure) and firewood (to boil Areca nuts before drying) would ensure the farmer to stand on his own and prevent him from unduly pressurizing the State Forests. Ten hamlets in Sringeri area of the Western Ghats were selected at random, from each of which nearly 10 farmers were interviewed by PRA technique for a socio-economic survey of the purpose, benefits and management of their individual SBFs. One representative SBF from each of the 10 hamlets was taken up for phytosociological survey and the results were compared with a natural forest benchmark selected nearby. Species diversity at all levels was higher in the SBFs than in the natural forest. Stand densities too were higher, but basal coverages were lower. The farmers were found to promote select species like Aporosa lindleyana, Memecylon umbellatum, Syzygium cumini and S. caryophyllatum for their foliage requirements. The benefits derived, lopping patterns, protection and planting attitudes of the farmers were marked with a differentiating scheme and the relative scores on these four heads of management attributes were summed up into a management value index (MVI). MVI was found to increase with the Areca-landholding status of the farmers, and optimization of the MVI was observed at an Areca-landholding to SBF ratio of 1\\xa0:\\xa01.5–2.5 for the low (0–1\\xa0ha), intermediate (1–2\\xa0ha) and rich (>2\\xa0ha) Areca-landholding categories. The optimization was most pronounced for the low landholding group of farmers. The average size-class distribution of tree species individuals of the 10 SBFs described the expected L-shaped curve similar to that of the natural forest, but possessed larger number of individuals in most of the size-classes.Interference competition by tigers, Panthera tigris, is widely reported to reduce leopard, Panthera pardus, density or cause its shift to more a marginal habitat. In Southeast Asia, lack of a medium sized prey, spotted deer (Axis axis), and increased consumption of sambar (Rusa unicolor) by leopards amplifies dietary overlap between these two large felids. In our study area in western Thailand, leopard density was 2.4 times that of tigers. Using scat analysis we estimated prey biomass in the diet of each species to examine resource competition between these species. Tigers had a 0.89 spatial overlap with leopards and leopards a 0.92 overlap with tigers. Larger prey in this system (>100\\u202fkg) composed 89.8 Ackerman\\'s coefficient, ACF, and 79.3% Chakrabati\\'s coefficient, CCF of the biomass in tiger diet and 47.0% (ACF) and 45.3% (CCF) of the biomass in leopard diet. Dietary overlap of prey >100\\u202fkg versus smaller prey (≤37\\u202fkg) between these felids was 74.4% (ACF) and 81.2% (CCF). Dense cover at our site may reduce interference competition from tigers. In turn, high leopard density and leopard consumption of young sambar likely increases resource competition with tigers and thus potentially reduces tiger density. Given current small tiger population sizes, it is important to recognize that leopards may compete with and potentially suppress tiger numbers at some locations throughout their range and this topic needs further study.Scholars and advocates increasingly favor rights-based approaches over traditional exclusionary policies in conservation. Yet, national and international conservation policies and programs have often led to the exclusion of forest-dependent peoples. This article proposes and tests the hypothesis that the failures of rights-based approaches in conservation can be attributed in significant measure to the political economic interest of the state in the tropics. To this end, the article presents findings from the empirical analysis of the Forest Rights Act of 2006 in India. Two key recommendations emerge from this analysis. One, the proposals for operationalizing rights-based approaches will likely be far more effective if they protect the inalienability of a minimal set of rights critical to the subsistence and well-being of forest people, as opposed to promising the protection of an expansive set of rights subject to the instrumentality of conservation. Two, the proponents of rights-based approaches in conservation need to guard against their actions reinforcing the institutional status quo of the state control of forests. This, in turn, requires international conservation groups to join hands with national forest rights movements.Despite being one of the dominant groups in freshwater ecosystems, morphological and ontogenetic studies on aquatic Hemiptera have received little attention in the Oriental region. We present the ontogenetic trajectory and allometry of the widespread Oriental belostomatid species, Diplonychus rusticus (Fabricius) for the first time. We have measured nine different morphological variables throughout the growth of the bug using both field captured and laboratory reared specimens. Our results suggest that the developmental instars can be distinguished by the size variables, as seen in the Principal Component Analysis. On the basis of a CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection) based regression tree, we also show that the characters – total length without head and maximum width – prove to be adequate for effective instar identification. The multivariate allometric growth pattern shows that different body parts exhibit different types of allometry. This is apparent in the allometry exhibited by forelegs and mid and hind legs, which show allometry of opposite polarities. This may be due to the different functions attributed to these body parts. Our results show that the growth pattern in D.\\xa0rusticus is comparable with the New World genus Belostoma, suggesting a conserved growth pattern in the family Belostomatidae.Technological advancement has allowed for consideration of electronic monitoring (EM) as a tool for improving the accuracy of logbook data and/or increasing the quantity of fishery-dependent data collected. In Australia, an integrated EM system was implemented in several managed fisheries, including the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery (ETBF) and the Gillnet Hook and Trap (GHAT) sector of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) from 1 July 2015. We compare logbook data from the first two years of EM operation to the previous six years, to measure changes in reported nominal catch and discard per unit effort (CPUE and DPUE) and interactions with protected species per-unit-effort (IPUE). We observed no significant increase in CPUE between non-EM (2009–2014) and EM (2015 and 2016) years for any species group in both the ETBF and GHAT. In contrast, DPUE increased significantly during the EM years for target, byproduct and bycatch species in the ETBF and for target species in the GHAT sector. There was a significant increase in the IPUE for seabirds, marine mammals and turtles in the ETBF and for dolphins and pinnipeds in the GHAT sector. While not discounting possible environmentally-driven shifts in availability and abundance, as well as individual vessel effects, the weight of evidence suggests the use of an integrated EM system has led to significant changes in logbook reporting of discarded catch and protected species interactions, particularly in the ETBF. Assuming this supposition is valid, we identify fishery-specific factors that might have influenced reporting behaviour.Habitat fragmentation, land cover change and biodiversity loss are often associated with village communities in protected areas, but the extent and intensity of such impacts are often inadequately assessed. We record resource use and depletion by human inhabitants by conducting ecological surveys in six villages and social surveys in all 13 villages of varying sizes in India’s Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary (492\\xa0km2). We examined the occurrence of 10 regionally-specific ecological indicators that encompassed several aspects of human activities. Thirty transects with 180 total sampling locations recorded the occurrence of these specific habitat disturbance variables. High correlations between the variables led to the use of principal component analysis to derive an effective summary index that reflected disturbance intensity and determined village ecological impacts spatially. A generalized linear model was fit to determine the rate at which disturbance decreases as we move away from village centers. Our model indicates that village size class, distance from the village and proximity to other villages were significant predictors of the disturbance index. The index distinguished each village’s spatially explicit ecological impact. We estimated that an average area of 23.7\\xa0km2 of the forest surrounding the six focal villages was altered by human activities. These six villages have directly impacted 8–10% of this protected area.Kodagu is one of the green districts in the Western Ghats, which contributes to a major share of coffee production in India with a rich cultural heritage, a significant part of which is a sustainable outlook in all aspects of life. The district is now witnessing a decline in its cultural and environmental vibrancy due to a number of reasons, notably, rapid urbanization, shift from the natural agricultural systems, destruction of the sacred groves, expansion of coffee plantations and reduction of the native green cover. The negative impact is indicated in various environmental statistical records. The College of Forestry, Ponnampet and University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore have proposed the Payment for Ecological Services through landscape labeling that could help alleviate the economic woes of the farmers and consequentially provide an opportunity to restore the ecological balance in Kodagu. The scope of the paper would be to investigate whether PES in conjunction with the cultural and social scenarios would be able to create a cultural renaissance in Kodagu.Amphibians are undergoing a global conservation crisis, and they are one of the most underrepresented groups of vertebrates in the global network of protected areas (PAs). In this study, we evaluated the ability of the world\\'s PAs to represent extant amphibian species. We also estimated the magnitude of the human footprint along the geographic distributions of gap species (i.e., those with distributions totally outside PAs). Twenty-four percent of species (n\\xa0=\\xa01535) are totally unrepresented, and another 18% (n\\xa0=\\xa01119) have less than 5% of their distribution inside PAs. Nearly half of all species with ranges under 1000\\xa0km2 do not occur inside any PA. Furthermore, more than 65% of the distribution of gap species is in human-dominated landscapes. Although the Earth\\'s PAs have greatly increased during the last ten years, the number of unprotected amphibians has also grown. Tropical countries in particular should strongly consider (1) the importance of using amphibians to drive conservation policies that eventually lead to the implementation and management of PAs, given amphibians\\' extinction risk and ability to act as bioindicators; (2) the effectiveness of national recovery plans for threatened amphibian species; and (3) the need for increased funding for scientific research to expand our knowledge of amphibian species. Meanwhile, data-deficient amphibian species should receive a higher priority than they usually receive in conservation planning, as a precautionary measure. Throughout this paper, we point out several challenges in creating more comprehensive amphibian conservation strategies and opportunities in the next decade.Ethnopharmacological relevanceTraditional medicine remained as the most affordable and easily accessible source of treatment for many ailments. The Malayali tribes living in the Kolli hills region of Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu has long history of ethnomedicinal knowledge has been remained unexplored hither to. Hence, this study was initiated with an aim to record the ethnomedicinal plants of Malayali tribes and to document and analyse the local knowledge on phytotherapy before environmental and cultural changes deplete the resources.MethodsIn order to document the phytotherapical knowledge, a field study was carried out between August 2012 and February 2014. The ethnomedicinal knowledge was recorded through interviews among the Malayali tribes, and traditional healers. In addition a semi structure questionnaire was used to collect information on the local name of the plant, plant part used for curing, method of preparation in phytoremedies and any other plants/agents used as ingredients. Factor of informant consensus (Fic), use value (UV), fidelity level (FL), relative importance (RI) and novelty index were employed in data analysis.ResultsCurrent research work reports total of 86 medicinal plant species belonging to 76 genera of 46 different families. Herbs constituted the largest growth habit (48 species, 56%) followed by trees (13 species, 15%) and shrubs (9 species, 11%) etc. Leaf 43 (46%) is the plant part widely used followed by whole plant 9 (10%), seeds and fruits 9 (10%) and root 7 (8%). Paste was the most common preparation method use in herbal recipes. These plants were used to treat various human diseases and ailments grouped under 19 disease categories with the highest number of species (31) being used for dermatological infections/diseases followed by gastro-intestinal ailments (28) and general health (15). Asystasia chelonoides (UV of 2.76) and Piper nigrum (UV of 2.12) are the most frequently and popularly used medicinal plant species in the study area.ConclusionThe result of the study revealed that there was high diversity of medicinal plants and traditional knowledge about the use, preparation, and application of which is still maintained in the study area. However, the knowledge of herbal medicine was held by elders. The decline in the use of plants by the younger generation may gradually lead to the fading away of indigenous knowledge associated with the plants.Rauvolfia serpentina L. is a high value medicinal plant having wide distribution in the tropics as well as other parts of the world. Thirteen accessions of Rauvolfia collected from different locations in the Western Ghat region of the peninsular India were analyzed for genetic variation using 15 ISSR primers. The 91 polymorphic amplicons generated were statistically analyzed using WinDist and PopGene software to calculate various diversity indices. Contrary to the general concept of low genetic variation associated with inbreeders, R. serpentina exhibits high genetic diversity as the similarity index value based on Nei and Li’s similarity coefficient ranges from 0.44 to 0.92 with mean value of 0.70. This is supported by other diversity parameters like Degree of genetic differentiation (Gst), Gene flow (Nm), Nei’s gene diversity (h) and Shannon index of genetic diversity (I). Cluster analysis showed characteristic grouping which is not in accordance with their geographical affiliation. The result indicates that ISSR markers are sufficiently informative in assessing genetic diversity across wild accessions of R. serpentina. The high genetic diversity observed in this otherwise self-pollinated plant entails the need for evolving effective ex-situ strategy for long-term conservation of this medicinal herb.Up-scaling the evaluation of threat status of biodiversity from species to ecosystem level has remained for long a research challenge in global conservation science. To meet this challenge, the present study makes an attempt toward actionable conservation prescription and assigning a threat category scheme for forest ecosystems. The scheme sets the quantitative criteria for evaluation of cumulative anthropogenic threats in grid cells, such as deforestation, degradation, fragmentation, forest fires and biological invasions. Adopting the convention of IUCN, five conservation status categories (i.e. Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable, Near Threatened, Least Concern) have been similarly adopted for the forest ecosystems facing these threats. The operational success of this scheme of threat categories at ecosystem level has been strengthened by remote sensing and field data generated for the forest ecosystems of Odisha, India. The threat category status of the forest ecosystems were identified by creating grids (5\\xa0km\\xa0×\\xa05\\xa0km) in GIS and assigned the degree of the threats for each grid. The database on deforestation was generated using topographical maps of 1935 and remote sensing data of 1975 and 2010. The degradation in forest ecosystems have been assessed based on the change in forest canopy closure, fragmentation pattern, forest fire distribution and impact of biological invasions. The analysis for conservation priority hotspots complements an assessment of the threatened ecosystems undergoing remarkable level of multiple threats. Areas under the danger of cumulative anthropogenic threats would have a higher priority. 5.8% grids of existing forest had included under the category of conservation priority hotspot-I, followed by 12.4% in conservation priority hotspot-II, and 12.5% in conservation priority hotspot-III. An integrated approach involving the cumulative anthropogenic threat indicators have been found to be the most appropriate tool to empirically evaluate the threat status of the forest ecosystems. Finally, identification of ecosystems especially those facing increasing extinction risks, as attempted in the present study, can help in devising an appropriate policy and management agenda for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.Within the framework of a programme on the functioning of dense moist evergreen forests of the Western Ghats, the French Institute of Pondicherry, in collaboration with the Karnataka Forest Department, installed permanent plots to monitor the dynamics of a low elevation forest. The preliminary results of the comparison of the demographic processes in two compartments are presented: one compartment had never been harvested, while the other was selectively felled in 1979–1980. They are compared in terms of species composition, recruitment, mortality and individual growth, in order to describe the natural forest dynamics and evaluate the impact of selective felling. In both compartments, the mortality rate, around 0.9% yr−1, is lower than in other tropical moist evergreen forests, while the average diameter increment, at 2.1 (unlogged stand) and 2.9 mm yr−1 (logged stand), is higher. The impact of selective felling, 10 to 15 years after the harvest, is mainly noticeable: (i) on mortality of trees with dbh>40 cm belonging to lower canopy and intermediate stratum species which died about four times more in the logged compartment; and (ii) on diameter increment of emergent and upper canopy tree species whose growth is still stimulated by about 50%. Despite the general trend of a reduction in the difference between the density and the basal area of the two compartments, medium-term modification of the demographic processes among the various structural ensembles in the logged compartment, indicates that selective felling may not be sustainable in the long-term without consequences on the forest structure and composition.Most of the world’s remaining terrestrial biodiversity exists in tropical ecosystems affected by human activities. Despite the threats to seasonally dry tropical ecosystems, little is known about the impact of human land use change on their conservation value. We used savanna woodlands within the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot as a case study to understand the effects of human land use on plant diversity. We investigated the effects of three common land-use activities – biomass extraction, livestock grazing and ground fire – on species richness and diversity, as well as species composition in terms of the breadth of geographic ranges of species present. We found that total species richness increased with livestock grazing due to increased understory richness. Overstory diversity and tree sapling diversity and richness decreased with more recent fire. Greater canopy openness was associated with increased understory richness and reduced overstory richness. The combination of fire and livestock grazing are likely to increase canopy openness, leading to a shift in diversity from the overstory to the understory. Although we found no change in species richness or diversity with biomass extraction, areas with biomass extraction had more widely distributed species and fewer narrowly distributed species, indicating land use may lead to biotic homogenization. Our results suggest that a mosaic of protected areas along with areas managed for biomass extraction and livestock grazing would be an effective way to balance the conservation of plant diversity with local communities’ needs while maintaining overall levels of plant species diversity in these savanna woodlands.To conserve a large, wide-ranging carnivore like the tiger, it is critical not only to maintain populations at key habitat sites, but also to enable the persistence of the species across much larger landscapes. To do this, it is important to establish well-linked habitat networks where sites for survival and reproduction of tigers are complemented by opportunities for dispersal and colonization. On the ground, expanding protection to areas with a potential for tiger recovery still remains the means of operationalizing the landscape approach. Yet, while the gazetting of protected areas is necessary to enable this, it is not sufficient. It is essential to benchmark and monitor the process by which establishment of protected areas must necessarily be followed by management changes that enable a recovery of tigers, their prey and their habitats. In this paper, we report a case study from the Cauvery and Malai Mahadeshwara Hills Wildlife Sanctuaries of southern India, where we document the infrastructural and institutional changes that ensued after an unprecedented expansion of protected areas in this landscape. Further, we establish ecological benchmarks of the abundance and distribution of tigers, the relative abundance of their prey, and the status of their habitats, against which the recovery of tigers in this area of vast conservation potential may be assessed over time.Connectivity for large mammals across human-altered landscapes results from movement by individuals that can be described via nested spatial scales as linkages (or zones or areas) with compatible land use types, constrictions that repeatedly funnel movement (as corridors) or impede it (as barriers), and the specific paths (or routes) across completely anthropogenic features (such as highways). Mitigation to facilitate animal movement through such landscapes requires similar attention to spatial scale, particularly when they involve complex topography, diverse types of human land use, and transportation infrastructure. We modeled connectivity for Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and gaur (Bos gaurus) in the Shencottah Gap, a multiple-use region separating two tiger reserves in the Western Ghats, India. Using 840\\xa0km of surveys for animal signs within a region of 621\\xa0km2, we modeled landscape linkages via resource selection functions integrated across two spatial resolutions, and then potential dispersal corridors within these linkages using circuit theoretical models. Within these corridors, we further identified potential small-scale movement paths across a busy transportation route via least-cost paths and evaluated their viability. Both elephants and gaur avoided human-dominated habitat, resulting in broken connectivity across the Shencottah Gap. Predicted corridor locations were sensitive to analysis resolution, and corridors derived from scale-integrated habitat models correlated best with habitat quality. Less than 1% of elephant and gaur detections occurred in habitat that was poorer in quality than the lowest-quality component of the movement path across the transportation route, suggesting that connectivity will require habitat improvement. Only 28% of dispersal corridor area and 5% of movement path length overlapped with the upper 50% quantile of the landscape linkage; thus, jointly modeling these three components enabled a more nuanced evaluation of connectivity than any of them in isolation.Available secondary suspended sediment data from the 1980s was analyzed together with new data collected during 2001–2003 at instrumented sites upstream and downstream of open-cast mining activities (∼4.2\\xa0km2) in an enclosure within the Kudremukh National Park in south India. More than 50% of the suspended sediment load in both the Bhadra River and Bhadra Reservoir comes from mining-affected lands that occupy <1% of the total catchment area (1968\\xa0km2). For baseflow conditions during the post-monsoon period of 2001, 0.02\\xa0Mg\\xa0km−2\\xa0day−1 of suspended sediment was discharged at the upstream site compared with 0.74\\xa0Mg\\xa0km−2\\xa0day−1 downstream of the mine. During the 2002 and 2003 monsoons, these rates increased to about 1.99 and 7.89\\xa0Mg\\xa0km−2\\xa0day−1 for upstream and downstream sites, respectively. The specific sediment yield above the mine is 239\\xa0Mg\\xa0km−2\\xa0year−1 versus 947\\xa0Mg\\xa0km−2\\xa0year−1 downstream. Sediment concentration downstream was significantly higher than upstream for all conditions. The current annual suspended sediment load below the mine ranges from 100,000 to over 150,000\\xa0Mg, depending on the size and frequency of large rain events. During the 2002 and 2003 monsoon seasons, 20–30% of the total suspended sediment load during the sampling period of 67 and 123 days, respectively, was transported in one single day and over one-third of the total recorded suspended load is discharged in less than 4 days in each monsoon. Daily rainfall and maximum hourly rainfall intensity were reasonable predictors of daily sediment loads downstream of the mine (R2\\xa0=\\xa00.71 and 0.575, respectively; p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). However, the upstream response was not predicted well by these variables, suggesting an absence of rapid overland pathways and/or reduced availability of easily transportable sediment on the less-disturbed lands above the mining area. Large episodic sediment events downstream of the mine were associated with daily rainfall >150\\xa0mm and hourly intensities exceeding 20\\xa0mm. One hundred and nine such episodic events occurred between 1990 and 2001 alone. A conservative estimate of the total suspended sediment load in the Bhadra River after mining commenced in the 1980s is 1.37\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0Mg, although the actual value could be considerably higher, up to 107\\xa0Mg. Comparison of historic data and another study in 1994, with recent measurements confirm that mining and associated activities in Kudremukh National Park are the greatest sources of sediment entering the Bhadra River; and the Bhadra river carries considerably more sediment now than before mining started damaging riverine ecosystems and disrupting downstream water resources.We evaluated the conservation attitudes of the local villagers living adjacent to the Kalakad–Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in southern India 6 years after implementation of a World Bank funded eco-development project. We assessed attitudes towards three facets of conservation: the tiger, an emblematic species signifying India\\'s commitment to wildlife conservation; the forest, a principle source of fuel-wood and other products; and the Forest Department, which manages the forest. More specifically we predicted that (i) attitudes would be an effective predictor of resource use interest in the forest and (ii) benefits obtained from the EDP would create more favorable attitudes towards conservation and the protected area employees. Twelve villages located within 3\\xa0km from the reserve boundary were chosen and 2–3% of the households interviewed with regard to their attitudes towards these three facets of conservation, their household resource use patterns, wealth, sex, age and length of residency. We found significant associations between wealth, sex, age and both tiger and forest conservation. Providing benefits has not changed the underlying attitudes of the communities. The poorer sections of society, whether receiving benefits or not, tended to support tiger conservation because conserving wildlife did not affect their livelihood in any way, whereas both the rich and poor had misgivings about forest conservation due to dependency on forest products. We conclude that the eco-development project has not effectively addressed the most important of the local concerns.Aboveground biomass of individual tree species by component and total biomass per unit area for four different stages of a recovering tropical dry deciduous forest stands, dominated by sal (Shorea robusta Gaertn. f.) of the Eastern Ghats, India were investigated during 2001–2002. Different periods of recovering (2, 4, 6, and 10-year) forest stands (84°13′E, 20°29′N) were selected in the Kandhamal district of Orissa, India and sample trees of all species were harvested. Tree species diversity was 23, 23, 21 and 22 in 2, 4, 6, and 10-year recovering stands, respectively. Species-wise Ixora pavetta showed the highest biomass in 2 and 4-year stands while Shorea robusta in 6 and 10-year stands. Component-wise, in all species, bole–wood contribution ranged between 22.6% and 60.9%. Aboveground tree biomass, in all the stands, was dominated by Shorea robusta, which ranged between 12.68 and 231.91\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1. Total aboveground tree biomass was 30.12, 49.21, 107.54 and 261.08\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1 in 2, 4, 6 and 10-year stands, respectively.Vanilla borneensis Rolfe is considered as a rare, endemic and threatened terrestrial climbing orchid of Assam, India. The plant is restricted to only two pockets of Assam with a poor population size. Therefore, conservation of this plant through proper scientific investigation is urgently needed. The present study has as its objectives to study the distribution, standardization of suitable macropropagation methods for reinforcement and reintroduction in suitable wild habitat, as determined by ecological niche modelling (ENM) for the purposes of conservation. For improving the conservation status of the species, potential area and habitat for reintroduction was determined using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) distribution modelling algorithm. Seed germination under natural conditions was found to be very poor for which a macropropagation protocol was standardized; plantlets were raised and reinforced to locations where the population size is very small i.e., mean density, frequency of occurrence and abundance in relation to other associated species was 17.77, 14.16 and 0.82 respectively. Macropropagation method standardized here through cutting was found to be more efficient in terms of time and cost. Application of 100\\xa0ppm indole −3- butyric acid (IBA) and 40\\xa0ppm naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) significantly improved rooting traits. Further, survival rate was measured significantly very high at 73% while 1000 numbers of V. borneensis plantlets were transferred to the field. Present study has improved the population and conservation status of V. borneensis.To what extent can private-sector bioprospecting incentives be relied upon for the protection of biological diversity? The literature contains dramatically different estimates of these incentives, from trivial to quite large. We resolve this controversy by isolating the fundamental source of the discrepancy and then providing empirically defensible estimates based on that analysis. Results demonstrate that the bioprospecting incentive is unlikely to generate much private-sector conservation. Thus, other mechanisms are likely required to preserve the public good of biodiversity.Sedimentationreduces the capacity of the reservoir and it is the important concern for watershed management. This paper presentsthe computation of sediment yield of Agrani River basin of Sangli and Belgavi districts in Maharashtra and Karnataka, India using RS and GIS techniques. The land use/land cover (LULC) map of the study area was prepared by supervised classification using satellite imagery of IRS P6 LISS III and ERDAS-imagine v9.1 image processing software. 26.67% of the area is occupied by agricultural land, 20.37% area covers forest land, 27.06% area of fallow land. Meteorological parameters such as average annual rainfall and mean annual temperature are then used to calculate amount of sediment yield in the reservoir. Garde model was used for determination of annual sediment yield. Mean annual runoff and sediment yield for investigating area is19.30 million m3 and 0.0897 million m3/year, respectively. With very fine drainage texture, drainage density in the study area is1.88 km/km2.Spatially explicit planning is required to set focused conservation priorities and assessing future ecological implications. Spatial ecological modeling and hotspot analysis prioritizes the forest ecosystems and supports the conservation of species level biodiversity. In the present study, the hotspots of deforestation and forest fires were obtained using historical deforestation trends (1975–1985–1995–2005–2014) and fire history (2009–2014) in Andhra Pradesh, India. The priority areas were identified as deforestation and degradation hotspots using combined measures of threat from deforestation, fire hotspots and current level of forest fragmentation. The state of Andhra Pradesh represents an area of 25985\\xa0km2 (16.2% of total geographical area) under forest cover in 2014. The net deforested area was estimated as 2390\\xa0km2 (8.4%) from 1975 to 2014. We have calculated the region of influence in percentages and found deforestation hotspots covering an average of 40.2% forest, followed by 35.9% under high fragmentation and 19.2% under fire hotspots. Ecosystem level analysis has been carried out for all the forest types i.e., semi evergreen, moist deciduous, dry deciduous, dry evergreen, thorn and mangroves, indicating ecosystem vulnerability. According to the results of prioritization, about 10.5% of existing forest had severe ecosystem collapse and categorized as deforestation and degradation hotspot-I. Analysis of protected areas shows Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve, Sri Peninsula Narasimha sanctuary, Papikonda sanctuary and Sri Venkateshwara sanctuary are representing deforestation and degradation hotspot-I. Deforestation and degradation hotspots identified in the study is an excellent surrogate for understanding anthropogenic disturbances and can be effectively useful in forest management to proceed for applicable restoration measures.IntroductionMedicinal plants have been used to treat various ailments since ancient times, as a result ethnobotanical investigations have a major role in pharmacological studies. The present study was conducted among the ethnic population known as the ‘Adiyans’, located in one of the little explored rich biodiversity areas in the Western Ghats. The aim was to collect and document information on the indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants.MethodsThe field survey was carried out during August 2015 to July 2016 among the Adiyan people in Chandanatodu, Thavihal and Thirunelly villages of the Wayanad district located in Kerala, India. Ethnomedicinal information was obtained through interviews/discussions and the collected data were analyzed using the informant consensus factor (Fic).ResultsFolk medicines practiced by indigenous people in the study area are used for their primary healthcare needs. The data gathered exemplified the knowledge of people using folk medicinal practices. Most of the documented claims used by Adiyans in the present study have not been shown in previous research in the nearby regions of Kerala, India and across the globe.ConclusionFinding further evidence for medicinal claims used by the indigenous community in this study highlights the need for scientific research to support documented folk use. Of the documented ethnomedicinal plants, Caesalpinia mimosoides, Desmodium triflorum, Elaeocarpus tuberculatus, E. serratus, Hydnocarpus macrocarpa, Pterospermum reticulatum, P. rubiginosum and Zizyphus nummularia have been poorly studied in vitro and in vivo models. It is important to validate their usage in terms of pharmacological activity.This paper takes its inspiration from Karl W. Butzer\\'s course on the Human Use of Landforms at the University of Chicago. It builds upon that concept through an exploration of regional settlement patterns and landforms in the Deccan volcanic province of west-central India. The first section develops a conceptual framework for analyzing human adjustment to landforms on regional, settlement, and site scales. The second section employs that framework to analyze four major landform-settlement configurations in the Deccan from antiquity to the end of the eighteenth century. The Satavahana kingdom (ca. 100\\u202fBCE to 200\\u202fCE) had a strong southeast to northwest alignment along the Godavari River. Their capital city of Paithan was located at a navigable sacred ford across the river (tirtha), which was linked with upstream confluences (sangams), tanks (kunds), mountain passes (ghats), and port cities on the Arabian Sea. Subsequent Hindu dynasties (ca. 850–1300\\u202fCE) shifted from fluvial landforms to a north-south alignment along steep mesa escarpments and buttes in the central Deccan that provided defensive fortress and cave temple sites. Sultanate and Mughal forces expanded the urban footprint on nearby plateau lands at sites protected by surrounding mesas (ca. 1330–1700\\u202fCE). These cities were supported by local watershed runoff and long distance water channels. The final precolonial phase of Deccan settlement entailed a shift from the semiarid central plateaus to humid headwaters of the Western Ghats, whose buttes and scarps provided sites for scores of forts controlled by the founder of the Maratha empire Chhatrapati Shivaji in the seventeenth century. Maratha success led to development downstream at the capital city of Pune (1627–1803\\u202fCE), located at a river confluence flanked by mesas, which combined the strategies of previous periods. Over two millennia these four distinct, yet intersecting, patterns of human-landform relations have shaped an evolving geocultural region on the Deccan plateau that deserves comparison with other flood basalt regions.This study documents a holistic approach, combining mineralogical, geochemical and textural data to characterize the decorative earthen plaster of the 2nd century BCE. Buddhist rock cut caves of Karle in Western India. The analytical examination was carried out by the use of a petrological microscope, Laser particle size analysis, thin section analysis, XRF (X Ray fluorescence), XRD (X Ray Diffraction), FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) and Raman spectroscopy in addition to the monitoring of environmental parameters. The results indicate that the local clayey soil, which is abundantly available in the high rain fed western coastal areas, was utilized for the earliest earthen plaster works. The characteristics of the clay seem to have been modified by mixing calcite and an organic adhesive. Rounded sub-angular aggregates derived from disintegration of basaltic rock and rice husk were added to influence shrinkage properties of the plaster. In addition to a better understanding of the technology and composition of ancient India\\'s early earthen plasterworks, scientific data from the analysis was used to plan the composition of restoration plaster.Urban botanical gardens conserve historical flora, improve the local environment and promote human well-being. Unfortunately they are often undervalued due to lack of public awareness or resources. Analysis of species diversity and turnover at long-lived gardens can improve the understanding of long-term plant resilience and help adapt management actions to align with rapidly changing urban contexts. Given the various threats faced by urban botanical gardens, we examined tree species diversity, historical changes and survival of plants at the Botanical Garden in Pondicherry (BGP), southern India, which was established 192 years ago by the colonial French government.A complete census of trees was carried out to compare current species diversity with two historical lists compiled 151 years ago and 57 years ago, respectively. These lists were also used to identify heritage trees. Effects of environmental threats, including the very severe cyclonic storm Thane (December 2011) and various damages to young stems, were analysed with Google Earth images and field inventories.There were 284 identified tree species, including 25 endangered/vulnerable/threatened species and 53 tropical dry evergreen forest species. Turnover had occurred, and approximately half of the historical species had been replaced with new species. Tropical Cyclone Thane caused severe damage to large trees and anthropogenic activities damaged saplings. Yet, at least 65 large resilient individuals had survived all the threats, and signifiy the adaptability and heritage value of the BGP.Our study revealed multiple values of this heritage green space in a rapidly developing South Asian city and suggests strategies for modernisation that are aligned with international conservation guidelines. We recommend better monitoring and utilisation of cyclone-damage data to guide future plant introductions at this coastal site.Conservation of existing remnants of tropical forests outside protected areas remains a major challenge because of developmental pressures. It is likely that, as forests outside of protected areas disappear, the pressure on protected areas will grow. Thus, it is important to conserve biodiversity outside protected areas, at least as buffers for protected areas, a conservation practice enshrined in the Aichi Biodiversity Targets for the 2011–2020 period. We designed a contingent valuation study to value the restoration of native trees on coffee plantations in the Kodagu district of Karnataka in India. Our study includes a sample of 1029 respondents who visited these sites. The survey was conducted using a pretested questionnaire to collect data from tourists between January and June 2016. We found that visitors derive positive benefits from the restoration of native tree species that form a dense tree-like ecosystem providing refuge for biodiversity not only on coffee plantations but also in adjoining protected areas. Visitors were willing to pay an average 187 Indian Rupees (INR) for the restoration program. The total estimated value for the restoration of native tree species is INR 47 million per annum. Thus, there is scope to collect and mobilize tourist revenue for the restoration program. We propose, in concurrence with local stakeholders, an institutional mechanism to generate and transfer the increased revenue from the surcharge to the coffee-growers to implement the proposed program.Understanding the impact of climate change on species invasion is crucial for sustainable biodiversity conservation. Through this study, we try to answer how species differing in phenological cycles, specifically Cassia tora and Lantana camara, differ in the manner in which they invade new regions in India in the future climate. Since both species occupy identical niches, exploring their invasive potential in different climate change scenarios will offer critical insights into invasion and inform ecosystem management. We use three modelling protocols (i.e., maximum entropy, generalised linear model and generalised additive model) to predict the current distribution. Projections are made for both moderate (A1B) and extreme (A2) IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) scenarios for the year 2050 and 2100. The study reveals that the distributions of C.\\xa0tora (annual) and L.\\xa0camara (perennial) would depend on the precipitation of the warmest quarter and moisture availability. C.\\xa0tora may demonstrate physiological tolerance to the mean diurnal temperature range and L.\\xa0camara to the solar radiation. C.\\xa0tora may invade central India, while L.\\xa0camara may invade the Western Himalaya, parts of the Eastern Himalaya and the Western Ghats. The distribution ranges of both species could shift in the northern and north-eastern directions in India, owing to changes in moisture availability. The possible alterations in precipitation regimes could lead to water stress, which might have cascading effects on species invasion. L.\\xa0camara might adapt to climate change better compared with C.\\xa0tora. This comparative analysis of the future distributions of two invasive plants with contrasting habits demonstrates that temporal complementarity would prevail over the competition.The Indus River dolphin (Platanista gangetica minor) is a freshwater cetacean that occurs only in the Indus River system in Pakistan and India. This review provides a comprehensive summary of issues surrounding Indus dolphin conservation, and includes a description of their distribution, the threats they face and a discussion of conservation and research activities, options and priorities. Information was gathered from published current and historical literature, newspaper articles, and unpublished reports. Prior to construction of the Indus Irrigation system dolphins occurred in 3500\\xa0km of the Indus River system. Their range has now declined by 80% due to fragmentation of river habitat by barrages and large-scale diversion of water for irrigated agriculture. The subspecies was estimated to number approximately 1450 individuals in 2011, and occurs in 6 subpopulations, three of which are probably too small to persist. There is an urgent need to evaluate whether dolphins move through barrages, as this has the potential to extirpate upstream subpopulations. Pre-requisites for dolphin translocations to combat this problem are outlined. Mortality in fishing gear and high levels of chemical pollution in water courses are both increasing threats exacerbated by depleted flows. Research and conservation priorities include maintenance of river flows, mortality monitoring, canal rescues and community-based conservation. Conservation and research action is urgently needed to prevent the Indus dolphin from succumbing to the same fate as the baiji.Chilika lake is the biggest lagoon in the Indian Eastern coast and is a source of livelihood for peoples of the coastal region surrounding it mainly through fisheries. However, the deposition of sediments in the lake carried through runoff water from its drainage basins may alter this wetland ecosystem in future. Implementation of appropriate soil water conservation measures may reduce the sediment load in runoff water and thus may protect this lagoon ecosystem. Keeping in view these concerns, runoff water from a selected watershed of western catchment of Chilika lagoon was modeled through ArcSWAT with a purpose to estimate future runoff potential from western catchment. Effective hydraulic conductivity of main channel, base flow alpha factor, curve number corresponding to antecedent moisture content II, and roughness coefficient of main channel were found most sensitive parameters in decreasing order. Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient of predicted monthly runoff was 0.72 and 0.88 during calibration and validation period, respectively whereas root mean squared error of predicted monthly runoff was 54.5 and 66.1\\xa0mm, respectively. Modeling results indicated that about 60% of rainfall is partitioned to runoff water, which carry significant amount of sediment load and contributes to Chilika lake.An ethnobotanical survey was carried out among the ethnic groups (Kani/Kanikaran) in Southern Western Ghats of India. Traditional uses of 54 plant species belonging to 26 families are described under this study. In this communication, the information got from the tribals were compared with the already existing literature on ethnobotany of India. The documented ethnomedicinal plants were mostly used to cure skin diseases, poison bites, wounds and rheumatism. The medicinal plants used by kanis are arranged alphabetically followed by family name, local name, major chemical constituents, parts used, mode of preparation and medicinal uses.This paper examines the growth of interrelated tourism phenomena yoga tourism and spiritual tourism - both sit under the wider umbrella of wellness tourism. Tourism has long been linked with spirituality and where this is the case (for example pilgrimage travel), it is considered to pave the way for personal transformation. Linking spiritual tourism to yoga tourism is a fait accompli, as is drawing similar associations with wellness and pilgrimage tourism on account of allied and abiding motivations predicated on uniting mind, body and spirit and these ruminations are central to this paper. More recently, there has been a growing chorus calling for the decolonisation of yoga on account of its commodification and industrialisation, and especially concerning what is argued to be a shift away from its spiritual and transformative tenets. The underlying meaning of the Sanskrit word yuj from which yoga is derived alludes to the pursuit of achieving a sense of union with something higher than oneself, and this is arguably one of the key drivers for its contemporary acceptance. Linkages between spirituality and yoga tourism through an examination of the motivations of Western yoga devotees in Maharashtra, India provide the canvas for this analysis. The motivations for yoga related travel and the broader implications for yoga and spiritual tourism are discussed. This article draws from two periods of exploratory fieldwork conducted in 2014 and 2015 in Maharashtra, India. A qualitative, case study scaffold underpinned by serious leisure as a conceptual framework (Stebbins, 2001) was constructed.The conservation challenges facing mega-biodiverse South and Southeast Asia in the 21st century are enormous. For millennia, much of the habitat of these regions was only lightly modified by human endeavour, yet now it is experiencing rampant deforestation, logging, biofuel cropping, invasive species expansion, and the synergies of climate change, drought, fire and sea-level rise. Although small-scale conservation management might assist some species and habitats, the broader sweep of problems requires big thinking and some radical solutions. Given the long expected lead times between progressive economic development and stabilization of human population size and consumption rates, we argue that ‘technological fixes’ cannot be ignored if we are to address social and fiscal drivers of environmental degradation and associated species extinctions in rapidly developing regions like southern Asia. The pursuit of cheap and abundant ‘clean’ energy from an economically rational mix of nuclear power, geothermal, solar, wind, and hydrogen-derivative ‘synfuels’, is fundamental to this goal. This will permit pathways of high-tech economic development that include intensified (high energy-input) agriculture over small land areas, full recycling of material goods, a transition from fossil-fuel use for transport and electricity generation, a rejection of tropical biofuels that require vast areas of arable land for production, and a viable alternative to the damming of major waterways like the Mekong, Murum and northern tributaries of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers for hydroelectricity. Rational approaches that work at large scales must be used to deal with the ultimate, rather than just proximate, drivers of biodiversity loss in the rapidly developing regions of southern Asia.The fate of much of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity is linked to the management of human-modified forest landscapes in the humid tropics. This Special Issue presents the first pan-tropical synthesis of research on the prospects for biodiversity in such systems, with eight individual regional summaries covering Mesoamerica, Amazonia, Atlantic forest of South America, West Africa, Madagascar, Western Ghats, Southeast Asia and Oceania. Two additional papers compare the state of conservation science in tropical forests with both temperate forests and savannah systems. This overview paper provides a comparative analysis of the threats and opportunities facing tropical forest biodiversity, thereby helping to identify the most pressing areas of future research and region-specific factors that contribute towards the effectiveness of individual conservation initiatives. While many of the threats facing tropical forest biodiversity are commonplace they vary markedly in their relative importance across different regions. There is a critical lack of comparable data to understand scale dependent processes, or the relative importance of varying geographic and historical contexts in determining present-day patterns. Conservation science has a key role to play in safeguarding the future of tropical forest biodiversity, but needs to become more effectively embedded in the context of real-world conservation challenges and opportunities. Significant progress can be achieved by improving the cost-effectiveness of research as well as the exchange of ideas and data amongst scientists working in different, often isolated parts of the world. We hope this special issue goes some way top achieving this exchange of knowledge.There is growing recognition that the fate of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity depends on the management of human-dominated tropical forest landscapes. While global environmental change is transforming the ecology of tropical forests, a number of studies have also demonstrated that tropical forests are able to recover following disturbance. But are tropical forests resilient to environmental and anthropogenic disturbances over timescales of centuries or millennia? Here we examine the relationship between vegetation cover and variation in monsoon rainfall, soil erosion, and fire over 7500\\xa0years in an ancient tropical landscape in the Western Ghats of India. We collected two overlapping sediment sequences at one study site and analysed them with palaeoecological techniques to reconstruct vegetation cover. Results suggest that climate and land-use changes might have had synergistic effects on this forested landscape, although the relationship between these factors and vegetation cover has varied over time. Results also indicate that the weakening of monsoon around 5750 BP might have caused a threshold event altering this landscape to a low tree-cover state. Although anthropogenic fire has maintained this landscape in low tree cover state from 3500 BP, this degraded tree–grassland mosaic has remained relatively resilient to fluctuations in environmental and anthropogenic factors. Tree taxa present throughout the sequence have lighter seeds than those absent in parts of the sequence, suggesting that dispersal mode might be an important factor in their persistence. Despite maintaining a degraded and fragmented forest mosaic, however, this landscape has supported populations of heavy-seeded trees and a probable refuge to their dispersal agents. We suggest that retaining tree cover on this landscape, even if fragmented, is key to maintaining its ecological resilience to environmental and anthropogenic disturbance.In India, conservation of biodiversity goes hand in hand with human welfare, as millions of people live adjacent or within protected areas and depend upon forests products. The high density and biomass requirements of these households could result in the degradation of forests and loss of biodiversity. We assessed the collection of forest products among households in five sites in the Western and Eastern Ghats of peninsular India: the Kogar region of the Central Western Ghats, the Bandipur and Sigur regions of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the Kalakad–Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve of the southern Western Ghats and Similipal Tiger Reserve of the northern Eastern Ghats, and tested whether extraction pressure on forests was associated with the proportion of agricultural households, wage labour and population density. We also examined whether data on loss of cover as stated by the State of the Forest Reports was supported by field data. The regions differed in land use: Kogar, KMTR and Similipal were primarily agricultural regions, whereas households engaged in wage labour or in running small businesses were predominant in Sigur and Bandipur. Fuel–wood was collected ubiquitously for household use in all sites, used mainly for domestic requirements and secondarily for generating income. Green leaves for making fertilizer and fodder were collected for household use and did not enter the market. Cattle manure for the global organic coffee industry was a major forest product in Bandipur and Sigur. Extraction pressure on forests was positively associated with the availability of wage labour and was negatively with the proportion of agricultural households. Data from official sources seem inadequate to measure forest degradation in protected forests. Accurate estimation of forest condition through field assessments and remote sensing, and understanding the socio-economic variables associated with forest loss and degradation are needed for the sustainable management of Indian protected areas.The population dynamics of the ground vegetation and its energetics such as biomass accumulation and net primary productivity, and the nutrient cycling patterns in the humid tropical forest of the Western Ghats in India are largely determined by gap age and by whether gaps are formed naturally or through selection felling. Responses of plant categories such as herbs, shrubs, tree seedlings and saplings also vary depending upon gap type and age. An exotic species such as Chromolaena odorata occurred only in selection-felled gaps ((9 ± 3)−(49 ± 4) individuals (100 m)−2). Nilgirianthus ciliatus, a dominant shrub, plays a key role in the gaps in determining population dynamics of others. The net primary productivity of the ground vegetation, which is about 31.17 ± 4.26 kg (100 m)−2 year−1 in an undisturbed site, increased a year after gap formation to 102.82 ± 6.46 kg (100 m)−2 year−1 in natural gaps and to 71.82 ± 2.36 kg (100 m)−2 year−1 in selection-felled gaps. Five years after gap formation, net primary productivity of the ground vegetation declined considerably, this being related to decline in fast-growing shrub and secondary tree species in the vegetation and gap closure. A similar trend was also recorded for the rates of nutrient uptake and nutrient accumulation in the vegetation.In natural gaps the soil nutrient level increased gradually with gap age. This could be attributed to slow release of nutrients from the fallen trunks and nutrient storage in the rapidly recovering vegetation. In contrast, in selection-felled gaps, the quantities of soil nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and magnesium were higher in 1-year-old gaps than in undisturbed sites, owing to the release of these nutrients from leaf litter and wood debris which were deposited in larger quantities within the gap itself, and owing to sparse ground vegetation resulting from the greater disturbance of the soil, in the first 1 or 2 years. The fractional annual turnover rates of elements of the ground vegetation and the soil were higher in 1-year-old gaps and declined with gap age. The significance of these results for forest management is discussed.The sustainable indigenous agro-ecosystems of India, a majority of which are degraded or destroyed, need protection. The main objective of this study was to analyse the traditional agro-ecosystems from structural and functional point of view and their interactions with other biophysical and socio-economic characters with a view to offer possible solutions. Analysis of traditional agro-ecosystems of three tribal villages, inhabited by Kondhs of Eastern Ghats of Orissa, India, revealed that cultivated land occupied 66% of the total land area. This covered valley, shifting and home garden cultivation. Under valley, rice (Oryza sativa L.) showed the maximum productivity (2–4\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1) among the crops. Minor millets and redgram (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) were cultivated under shifting cultivation in one of the villages. Vegetables and spices were the main crop under home garden. In valley agriculture human and draught power were the major inputs of energy, while in shifting cultivation human labour was the only source. Out of the total agricultural yield, 52.5, 90.6 and 75.9% were consumed in the villages of Rajikakhola, Nediguda and Badruguda, respectively. When agriculture, forest and animal husbandry sectors were taken together the average share of agricultural sector to the total consumption in the villages was 68.4%, the rest being contributed by forest, while the contribution of animal husbandry was almost negligible. Agricultural production can be stabilized through available rain water management, application of organic manure to agricultural fields and protection of the existing forests. Abandoned Podu (i.e. shifting cultivation) fields can be improved through agro-forestry practices. structure is known to vary across different scales of geographical separation, from differences between neighbours in a habitat to populations across continents. The high-elevation regions of the Western Ghats mountains in southern India form ‘sky islands’ containing the unique Shola habitat. Bird species on such sky islands are often specifically adapted to habitats typical of these islands while populations on different islands may have been geographically isolated over varying periods of time. Forest fragmentation can intensify the effects of such isolation by affecting species dispersal processes. We examined the effects of genetic differentiation across populations on the song of a threatened, endemic bird, the white-bellied shortwing, Brachypteryx major, on different islands of this sky island system. We compared songs from three populations, one of which on one island was genetically distinct from the other two populations on another island. These two populations were genetically similar but separated by recent deforestation. We recorded songs from 23 individuals and characterized 572 songs by 13 parameters. Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences in song between the three populations, with the genetically distinct populations across the two islands being the most differentiated. This was supported by a visual and aural examination of spectrograms that revealed characteristic qualitative differences in songs across these populations. Finally, this study corroborates accepted patterns of congruence between song and genetic divergence across islands and also highlights the difference in song between anthropogenically fragmented, but genetically similar populations, possibly owing to cultural drift.A 98\\xa0cm core from Potapuram Cheruvu, a rain-fed tank in the Nallamalai Hills of south India, has been palynologically analyzed to study the changes in vegetation and climate of the recent past. This run-off harvesting reservoir, chosen on the basis of remote sensing analysis and field surveys, is not linked with any major river. Its water level is the lowest in the summer, for two to three months, during which time the sampling was carried out. The site, lying south of the “core monsoon zone”, gets most of its rains from the south-west monsoon. Palynological studies yielded 75 pollen taxa with “dryness”, “wetness”, and “human-impact” markers. The ecological attributes of the plant species assigned to the pollen taxa provide an indirect link to specific environments (wetter/drier) that supported the land cover. The analyzed core revealed the vegetation history around the site during the past two centuries through pollen analyses supported by remote sensing. Even during this short period, distinct fluctuations in the vegetation assemblages were observed. Remote sensing indicates that the forest cover did not change significantly during the past ∼30 years. During this period there was also a change in the area covered by scrub and agriculture. Taken together and linked to the variations of the individual forest tree markers, this leads to the following story: a definitely drier period between ca. AD 1798 and AD 1846 and a definitely wetter one between ca. AD 1876 and AD 1920. The results from the RS and GIS show that while there was almost no change in the forest cover of the Potapuram Cheruvu watershed between 1973 and 2005, taking into account the tank\\'s seasonality by analyzing the wet and dry seasons, there was a notable decrease in the forest cover between 1924 and 1973.Strict protected areas are a critical component in global biodiversity conservation, but the future of biodiversity conservation may well depend upon the ability to experiment successfully with a range of institutional forms, including those that permit human use. Here, we focus on forest commons in human-dominated landscapes and their role in biodiversity conservation at the same time as they provide livelihood benefits to users. Using a dataset of 59 forest commons located in Bhutan, India, and Nepal, we estimated tree species richness from plot vegetation data collected in each forest, and drew on interview data to calculate a livelihoods index indicating the overall contribution of each forest to villager livelihoods for firewood, fodder, and timber. We found that tree species richness and livelihoods were positively and significantly correlated (rho\\xa0=\\xa0.41, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001, N\\xa0=\\xa059). This relationship held regardless of forest type or country, though significance varied somewhat across these two factors. Further, both benefits were similarly associated with several drivers of social-ecological change (e.g., occupational diversity of forest users, total number of users, and forest size), suggesting identification of potential synergies and complexes of causal mechanisms for future attention. Our analysis shows that forest commons in South Asia, explicitly managed to provide livelihoods for local populations, also provide biodiversity benefits. More broadly, our findings suggest that although strict protected areas are effective tools for biodiversity conservation, a singular focus on them risks ignoring other resource governance approaches that can fruitfully complement existing conservation regimes.Ethnopharmacological relevanceIt is becoming increasingly clear that ethnopharmacology cannot be disassociated from food production, human nutrition and the conservation of the biodiversity that constitutes its resource base.Aim of the studyThis paper aims to provide a perspective of ethnopharmacology that explicitly extends the range of disciplines it covers so as to embrace food and nutrition and the biodiversity basis, both wild and agricultural, and also places it in the context of the dramatic changes to our planet that we are experiencing during a period of rapid global change and the impacts that these changes are having on human health and nutrition and on its resource base.Materials and methodsA review is made of recent initiatives and developments that show linkages between ethnopharmacology, agriculture, food production, nutrition and biodiversity conservation.ResultsEthnopharmacology, biodiversity, agriculture, food and nutrition are inextricably linked but suffer from compartmentalization and a lack of communication which have to be overcome if progress is to be made. Fortunately, a convergence of interest between the agricultural biodiversity and the biodiversity conservation sectors has emerged in recent years and there is an increased appreciation of the need to adopt a wider approach to human nutrition than the conventional agricultural model allows; there is also a greater awareness of the important role played by diversity of crops, especially local species, and consumption of wild species in achieving balanced nutrition. An increased recognition of the key role of local communities in managing agricultural biodiversity is evident. While ethnopharmacologists have expressed concern at the relentless loss of biodiversity, there has been little direct involvement but it is perhaps now time to consider a more proactive role. Attention is also drawn to the need to assess the implications of global change for ethnopharmacology.ConclusionsEthnopharmacologists need to take much more cognizance of the fate of the resource base – the plants, animals and microorganisms – and of the actions being undertaken under the auspices of treaties, such as the Conservation on Biological Diversity and its Global Strategy for Plant Conservation, and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, to counter its degradation and loss. In addition, they should play a more active role in determining the actions needed to assess, monitor and conserve the resource base. Although it has been suggested that the ‘golden days’ of ethnopharmacology may be over, it is proposed that by embracing the challenges of broadening the remit so as to include the health aspects of wild biodiversity employed in nutrition, a new ‘golden age’ beckons. The paper concludes with some suggestions for action.Effective monitoring of biodiversity for conservation requires information on spatial and temporal variation in species’ abundances. As conservation resources are limited, monitoring methods are required that enable rapid and cost effective data collection. There are many traditional methods of estimating absolute abundance, such as territory mapping and distance sampling. However, these typically require more time, expertise and finances than are available across much of the globe. This is especially so in the tropics, where high species richness, low densities of many species and structurally complex environments also make monitoring particularly challenging. The MacKinnon lists technique is a rapid assessment methodology designed for use in species rich environments. This method is typically used to estimate species richness, but it has also been suggested that it can generate consistent abundance indices, even when observer experience and environmental conditions vary. If this suggestion is correct, the MacKinnon lists method could be used to assess spatial or temporal changes in abundance using diverse survey data. Here, we provide the first detailed assessment of intra- and inter-observer consistency of the Mackinnon List method in generating species abundance indices that could be useful for conservation monitoring purposes. As a case study, we use one of the world’s most diverse avifaunas, that of the forested Bolivian Andes. We show that MacKinnon lists can provide species abundance indices that are consistent between observers of markedly different experience of the focal avifauna (zero to six years), and between assessments carried out in different stages of the breeding season, between which detectability of individuals differed significantly. We believe this is the first time that a biodiversity monitoring method has been demonstrated to produce consistent abundance indices for a highly diverse avian tropical assemblage. We also suggest that the MacKinnon lists methodology has the potential to be a very useful conservation monitoring tool for many taxa in species rich environments, such as the tropics.nderstanding of the role and potential of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) for livelihood improvement and conservation has been hindered by a lack of a clear theoretical framework and a functional typology of cases. To help fill this gap, we did a comparative analysis of 61 cases of commercial NTFP production in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Cases were documented using a standardized set of descriptors organized into categories describing various aspects of the production-to-consumption system. Exploratory analysis yielded useful case groupings by (a) household economic strategy and (b) NTFP production strategy. These groups and their key characteristics are used as a basis for discussing the development and conservation implications of NTFPs.Groundwater, a renewable and finite natural resource, is a vital source of sustenance for humans and different ecosystems in the semi-arid regions. Rapid population growth in the last three decades has caused a rise in water demand which has inadvertently posed a stress on its availability. Occurrence of groundwater in the Deccan Volcanic Province is governed by the subsurface hydrogeological heterogeneity of basaltic lava flows and by the presence of geological structures like dykes, sills and fractures that influence spatial & vertical groundwater flow. The main objective of this paper is to map and assess areas that are naturally most susceptible to groundwater scarcity and at risk of depletion due to over extraction. The current study involves a field hydrogeological mapping that was integrated with remote sensing and GIS to delineate areas. This technique was based on using different thematic layers viz. lithology, slope, land-use and land cover, lineament, drainage, soil type, depth to groundwater and annual rainfall. Additionally, pumping tests were carried out to classify the study area into different hydrogeological typologies to help delineate communities that are most vulnerable to subsurface heterogeneity. This paper attempts to underline the groundwater scarcity zones based on different influencing thematic layers and provide a robust methodology to prioritize areas vulnerable to groundwater unavailability, by categorizing the study area into different vulnerable class types – extreme, high, moderate and low.The genus Swertia (Gentianaceae) is one of the most potent and traded herbs in Asian countries that has been described in the Indian, British and American pharmacopoeias as tinctures and infusions, and has also been reported in Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha traditional systems of medicines. Several Swertia species are declared as critically endangered in line with its increasing demand in therapeutic industries, and as a consequence, a gap is continuously increasing between the commercial demand and supply of Swertia herb. The present study aims to assess the molecular and phytochemical diversity among 48 accessions of five Swertia species collected from Western Himalayas, India. Using 16 inter sequence simple repeats (ISSR) and 18 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, total 202 and 291 polymorphic bands were documented, respectively. Percentage of polymorphism ranged from 89% to 100%, and 75% to 95%, with an average of 94.8%, and 89.8%, respectively with the ISSR and RAPD primers. Overall, high level of intra-specific genetic diversity (Gst: 0.40; h: 0.20; I: 0.30) was observed among S. paniculata accessions whereas S. chirata accessions (Gst: 0.16; h: 0.08; I: 0.18) showed least genetic diversity. Moreover, among all the Swertia accessions, maximum yield of amarogentin (0.75\\u202f±\\u202f0.20%), and swertiamarin (6.68\\u202f±\\u202f0.10%) was found in the S. chirata collected from Chakrata-Deoban (Uttarakhand), followed by S. paniculata accessions collected from Triund-Trek Mountains (Himachal Pradesh) that displayed 0.66\\u202f±\\u202f0.10% amarogentin and 5.76\\u202f±\\u202f0.03% swertiamarin contents. Densitogram based on the complete linkage, Euclidean distance and similarity level also revealed highest phytochemical diversity among S. paniculata accessions. In the present study, both molecular and phytochemical markers visibly categorize different Swertia species and thus these approaches can be used as significant tools for the assessment of genetic diversity among genotypes of Swertia. In this study, the potent S. chirata displays a low degree of genetic diversity and gene flow, and therefore there is a major risk of extinction of this significant species. The results of the present study would be useful to identify the promising genotype and to develop conservation strategies for the elite Swertia species.Yet there is considerable uncertainty over management effectiveness of many protected areas around the world. In this regard, long-term monitoring and management of disturbances in the protected areas need to be properly addressed and documented. The present study is aimed to analyze spatial extent, frequency and distribution of forest fires in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, Western Ghats, India over four decades (1973–2014). Multi-temporal Landsat and Indian Remote Sensing satellite data were used to quantify forest burnt area. The results showed that the spatial extent of burnt area greatly varied between 1318\\u202fkm2 (in 1989) to 15.7\\u202fkm2 (in 2013). The monitoring of fires during the recent decade (2005–2014) was observed to have a gradual decline over the reserve. High frequency of fires has been found in dry deciduous forest followed by moist deciduous forest, scrub, grassland and semi-evergreen forest. Among six protected areas, Bandipur National Park had represented more fire incidents followed by Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Nagarhole and Mukurthi National Parks. Grid analysis shows that 67% of the grids were affected by forest fires. Large burnt patches have steadily decreased in their size while the other patch classes showed a significant reduction in their size over the study period. This study had revealed the role of climate and accessibility in relation to fire occurrences. Based on historical burnt area mapping outputs, fire hotspots have been modeled to address fire risk zones. Indeed, the Mann-Kendall trend test has indicated that the overall trend of fire incidents have been declining and this indicates the management effectiveness in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve.While the collection of fish for the aquarium pet trade has been flagged as a major threat to wild populations, this link is tenuous for the unregulated wild collection of endemic species because of the lack of quantitative data. In this paper, we examine the extent and magnitude of collection and trade of endemic and threatened freshwater fishes from India for the pet markets, and discuss their conservation implications. Using data on aquarium fishes exported from India, we try to understand nature of the trade in terms of species composition, volume, exit points, and importing countries. Most trade in India is carried out under a generic label of “live aquarium fish”; yet despite this fact, we extracted export data for at least thirty endemic species that are listed as threatened in the IUCN Red List. Of the 1.5\\xa0million individual threatened freshwater fish exported, the major share was contributed by three species; Botia striata (Endangered), Carinotetraodon travancoricus (Vulnerable) and the Red Lined Torpedo Barbs (a species complex primarily consisting of Puntius denisonii and Puntius chalakkudiensis, both ‘Endangered’). Using the endangered Red Lined Torpedo Barbs as a case study, we demonstrate how existing local regulations on aquarium fish collections and trade are poorly enforced, and are of little conservation value. In spite of the fact that several threatened and conservation concern species are routinely exported, India has yet to frame national legislation on freshwater aquarium trade. Our analysis of the trade in wild caught freshwater fishes from two global biodiversity hotspots provides a first assessment of the trade in endangered and threatened species. We suggest that the unmanaged collections of these endemic species could be a much more severe threat to freshwater biodiversity than hitherto recognized, and present realistic options for management.I studied the distribution pattern, population structure and conservation status of rare and endangered medicinal plant species in Spiti sub-division of Himachal Pradesh in the Indian trans-Himalaya. The entire study area was stratified into six zones based on geomorphological and phytogeographical variations. In each zone different habitat types for rare and endangered species were identified and sampled using quadrats. A total of 23 rare and endangered medicinal plants were found in Spiti, distributed over 10 major habitat types. All the rare and endangered medicinal plants were localised and found in patches. The patch size for different species varied greatly from 1 to 20,000 m2. There were large differences in the number of rare and endangered medicinal plant species within different zones of Spiti. More species of rare and endangered medicinal plants occurred close to the Great Himalayan range in the southern part of the study area. The highest mean density was estimated for Picrorhiza kurrooa followed by Saussurea gnaphaloides. The results are discussed in the light of rare and endangered medicinal plants conservation with the strong recommendation of the establishment of medicinal plants conservation areas in this part of trans-Himalaya.White sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are globally distributed, protected in several countries, including Australia, and potentially dangerous to humans. Following a recent spate of fatal white shark attacks, the Government of Western Australia introduced a range of initiatives to mitigate shark hazards. An increasing trend in shark attacks over the last 20 years has been commonly perceived to be the result of an increase in population abundance since the species’ protection in Australian waters in 1997. We modelled potential population productivity and trajectories using different scenarios of life-history strategies, unexploited population sizes, reconstructed fishery catches and post-capture mortality. Under zero fishing mortality, the potential annual increase in population abundance varied from 2 to 6% per year, depending upon the assumed life history strategy. Depending upon model inputs there was a wide range of potential declines in abundance since 1938/39 and significant differences in the potential population trajectories since protection. However, no scenario (n\\xa0=\\xa0120) resulted in a total population increase of >31% since protection, with most scenarios showing population increase of 10% or less. We present a method for exploring the effects of alternative hypotheses about key population parameters when data are scarce and when scientific advice is required for guiding decision making and informing public debate.The tropical rainforest in the south-western Ghats of Kerala State was surveyed in May 1993 with the help of trained volunteers and Forest department staff to assess the status and distribution of the endangered lion-tailed macaque Macaca silenus. A total of 564 macaques in 64 troops were sighted during the survey. It is estimated that the number of lion-tailed macaques in Kerala is a minimum of 1216 but only three areas are identified as having viable populations with long-term conservation prospects. Most sightings of troops were in Protected Areas. The present survey indicates its absence in the ranges reported earlier, such as Cardamom Hills and South Wayanad. Maintenance of existing contiguous patches of evergreen forest and inclusion of suitable management strategies in Working Plans for non-Protected Areas are suggested.National conservation planning should operate with measures of biodiversity similar to those applied globally in order to harmonize national and international conservation strategies. Here we suggest quantitative measures which enable two criteria of the global biodiversity hotspots to be applied on a national level for 74 large countries, and show how these measures can be applied to map national biodiversity hotspots. The plant endemism criteria of global hotspots are captured by quantitative measures of endemism, which are approximately scale-independent and can be corrected to account for a country’s environmental conditions and conservation priorities. The flexible land use criteria for national biodiversity hotspots are defined from percentage of natural vegetation remaining in the global hotspots. The minimum-area-required approach is applied to define the borders of national biodiversity hotspots using data on vascular plants species richness. We show how national biodiversity hotspots can be mapped from the species–energy relationship for vascular plants using climate, topographical and land use data when spatial pattern of species richness is not known. This methodology to map national biodiversity hotspots from abiotic factors is applied to Russia as a case study. Three Russian biodiversity hotspots, North Caucasus, South Siberia and Far East were identified. The resulting hotspot maps cover national-scale environmental gradients across Russia and although they are also identified by Russian experts their actual geographical locations were hitherto unspecified. The large-scale national hotspots, identified for Russia, can be used for further fine scale and more detailed conservation planning.The relocation and resettlement of people from nature reserves is a controversial issue in the conservation community. The perceived poor success rate of resettlement efforts, combined with availability of few well-documented studies, warrants a detailed examination of this issue. I have analyzed a relocation and resettlement project in India’s Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary. I examine the relocation experience of 419 households who moved to two villages located outside the reserve. I interviewed 61% of relocated households in 2002 and 55% relocated households in 2006. In 2002, 71% of households were satisfied with the relocation effort and their quality of life. In 2006, 52% of households were satisfied with their quality of life. Four years after relocation, all households have access to electricity, water, schools, health care, transportation, and communication facilities. Many households have increased their income and assets. Yet, there were differences between the two different-resettlement villages, with one of them faring better in terms of economics, hardships, and uncertainty. This paper draws out insights important for improving conservation practices related to resettlement efforts. It documents short to mid-term successes and challenges that affect the communities involved. I submit that in specific contexts, relocation may be a viable conservation tool. Successful conservation resettlement requires substantial financial support to meet people’s socio-economic needs, active consultation of the people involved, and partnerships of committed non-governmental and governmental organizations.Climate change and land-cover change will have major impacts on biodiversity persistence worldwide. These two stressors are likely to interact, but how climate change will mediate the effects of land-cover change remains poorly understood. Here we use an empirically-derived model of the interaction between habitat loss and climate to predict the implications of this for biodiversity loss and conservation priorities at a global scale. Risk analysis was used to estimate the risk of biodiversity loss due to alternative future land-cover change scenarios and to quantify how climate change mediates this risk. We demonstrate that the interaction of climate change with land-cover change could increase the impact of land-cover change on birds and mammals by up to 43% and 24% respectively and alter the spatial distribution of threats. Additionally, we show that the ranking of global biodiversity hotspots by threat depends critically on the interaction between climate change and habitat loss. Our study suggests that the investment of conservation resources will likely change once the interaction between climate change and land-cover change is taken into account. We argue that global conservation efforts must take this into account if we are to develop cost-effective conservation policies and strategies under global change.Forests and grassy vegetation (savannas and grasslands) are alternative ecosystem states in many tropical landscapes. Relative to forests the grassy ecosystems are poorly known and poorly conserved, partly because they were thought to be products of forest clearance. However many grasslands have proved to be ancient. Commensurate with their antiquity, grassy biomes have distinct suites of plant and animal species that contribute a large fraction of the diversity of forest–grassland mosaics. Grasslands differ strikingly from forests in their ecology and in the nature of threats to their future. Here we highlight the high biodiversity value of grassy biomes and, in contrast to tropical forests, we illustrate the importance of fire in maintaining these systems. We discuss the major threats to, and consequences for, biodiversity in these regions including land clearance and elevated CO2-driven forest expansion. Finally we focus on the difficulties of grassland restoration. A new approach to understanding and conserving grassy ecosystems, free from cultural prejudices of the past, is long overdue.Rural communities have traditionally valued forests for a diversity of products and services, with timber serving a minor role. No-where has this diversity been greater than in tropical South Asia, and in particular south India and Sri Lanka. As economies advance towards full development and populations become increasingly urbanized, forests become increasingly valued for their services. National development generally occurs at differing rates in different regions, with rural forest dependent communities falling behind and pockets of poverty long remaining. The demand for ‘non-timber forest products’ (NTFPs) therefore changes from subsistence to monetary based values. Overall, though, forests have suffered an unprecedented decline with development in the tropics, especially in Asia. This necessitates restoration which takes account of the enrichment of economy, wellbeing and culture which forest products provide. Methods for such restoration, and the fundamental principles upon which these must rest, are presented for species yielding NTFP’s. In this paper we first review the history of NTFP species use within south India and Sri Lanka. Second we provide a description of the broad regional characterizations of the forest formations within this region in relation to their affiliated patterns of NTFP use and exploitation. We consider seven guilds as a way to categorize NTFP’s into autecological groups for application in restoration silviculture, and use it as a framework to suggest restoration protocols for South Asian forests. We use examples of scenarios based on experimental studies of NTFP’s in reforestation trials which take account of different social values and land tenures. We conclude with a call for further research.A comprehensive methodology that integrates Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques was adopted to determine the soil erosion vulnerability of a forested mountainous sub-watershed in Kerala, India. The spatial pattern of annual soil erosion rate was obtained by integrating geo-environmental variables in a raster based GIS method. GIS data layers including, rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodability (K), slope length and steepness (LS), cover management (C) and conservation practice (P) factors were computed to determine their effects on average annual soil loss in the area. The resultant map of annual soil erosion shows a maximum soil loss of 17.73\\xa0t h-1 y-1 with a close relation to grass land areas, degraded forests and deciduous forests on the steep side-slopes (with high LS). The spatial erosion maps generated with RUSLE method and GIS can serve as effective inputs in deriving strategies for land planning and management in the environmentally sensitive mountainous areas.Located in the foothills of the Indian Himalaya, Rajaji National Park was established to protect and enhance the habitat of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and tiger (Panthera tigris). In 2002 the Van Gujjars, indigenous forest pastoralists, were voluntarily resettled from the Chilla Range (an administrative unit of Rajaji National Park) to Gaindikhata, a nearby area where they were granted land for agriculture. In this study we used a variety of remote sensing approaches to identify changes in land cover associated with the resettlement. The methods comprise two main approaches. First, we used object-based image analysis (OBIA) to identify the pre-resettlement land cover classes of use areas (representing agricultural expansion and adjacent areas of grazing, and collection of fuelwood and fodder) and recovery areas (representing areas where settlements were removed, and the adjacent areas of resource use). Secondly, we used trend analysis to assess the gradual and abrupt changes in vegetation that took place in use and recovery areas. To conduct the trend analysis we used BFAST (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend), which separates seasonal variation from long-term trends, and identifies breaks that can be linked back to disturbances or land cover changes. We found that the OBIA classification yielded high average class accuracies, and we were able to make class distinctions that would have been difficult to make using a traditional pixel-based approach. Pre-resettlement, the recovery areas were classified as mixed forest and riparian vegetation. In contrast, the use areas were classified primarily as grass dominated, brush dominated, and plantation forest, and were located relatively far away from riparian areas. Following the resettlement, the trend analysis showed a sudden change in the seasonal variation of NDVI in areas converted to agriculture. Areas neighboring the new agricultural land experienced sudden decreases in NDVI, suggestive of disturbances, at a higher rate than the same land cover types elsewhere. At the same time, these neighboring areas experienced a gradual overall increase in NDVI which could be caused by an expansion of leafy invasive shrubs such as Lantana camara in areas heavily used for biomass collection. The recovery areas also experienced a gradual increase in NDVI as well as sudden breaks to this trend, but we lacked evidence to connect these changes to the resettlement. Our findings support the claim that the resettlement has shifted pressure from more ecologically valuable to less ecologically valuable land cover types, and suggest that to some degree resource use pressure has increased outside the park. The study employs a novel synthesis of OBIA and trend analysis that could be applied to land change studies more broadly.Water is essential for all living beings. It is a major concern to provide water to all. It is a challenge to supply water to all major cities in Dakshina Kannada district, Karnataka, India. Nethravathi River is one of the major sources of water in the region which yields about 1240TMC per year. Nethravathi River has its origins in Western Ghats of Karnataka flowing to a length of 126 Km and joins Arabian Sea. In Dakshina Kannada district all major cities face water scarcity in summer season even after getting an average annual rainfall of 3.75 – 4.25 m. It is a major challenge to the district administration for providing required water to the people during summer season in spite of plenty of water available during monsoon. This paper highlights in giving solution to this issue after studying various parameters like geographical structure, rainfall data and climate, study of catchment area, storage methods, water demand and water supply schemes available in the region. An attempt has been made to suggest for supplying the water to the cities in Dakshina Kannada district by increasing the storage capacity on the upstream side of the river to get water round the clock.Forest fragmentation is considered as one of the major conservation issue. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the national assessment of spatial patterns of forest fragmentation and influence of deforestation on fragmentation in the Indian forests during three decade interval (1975-2005). Mapping of forest cover was carried out based on Landsat MSS and IRS P6 AWiFS data using hybrid classification techniques on 1:250,000 scale. The present study considered biogeographic zones as a major stratum for national level assessment. The forest fragmentation was analysed based on landscape indices which allow quantification and categorisation of complex forest landscapes and depict landscape composition, structure and scenario of fragmentation. The analysis revealed that in all biogeographic zones, more than 90% of total number of forest fragments consists of patches having area less than 1\\xa0km2. At national level the mean forest patch size stands at 187\\xa0ha. The total core area was highest for Islands (87.4%) followed by Eastern Himalayas (82.5%), Deccan (78.9%), Deserts (76.4%) and Eastern Ghats (76%). The temporal analysis shows that the loss of Indian forest area as 5.8% during 1975–2005. The annual rate of deforestation has been computed as 0.20% at national level. The decreased mean patch size, increased edge density and increased number of patches from 1975 to 2005 indicates ongoing fragmentation in biogeographic zones. The very high fragmentation in Trans Himalayas is contributed mostly by the natural factors while in other biogeographic zones, increased fragmentation is due to deforestation.The nests of the Edible-nest Swiftlet (Collocalia fuciphaga) rank amongst the world\\'s most expensive animal products, which has resulted in high levels of exploitation of its nests in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India. The population of the Edible-nest Swiftlet was assessed through nest counts, and declines in population were estimated through changes in nest yields. The minimum breeding population of C. fuciphaga was estimated to be 13,260 birds, and the species currently bred in 291 caves, and had abandoned 31 caves. Nest collection in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands had taken place in 95% of breeding sites. Less than 2% of the nests counted had either eggs or chicks in them. The decline in swiftlet nest yields in the Andaman islands, between the present and 5–8 years ago (195 caves) has been 61%, and between the present and over 10 years ago (45 caves) has been 83%. Depending on the patterns of nest collection, declines in yield in the Nicobar Islands range between 40 and 95%, with only one cave apparently not having undergone a significant loss. The Edible-nest Swiftlet is critically threatened (IUCN criteria A1c) in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, as it has undergone a reduction in numbers greater than 80% over the last 10 years. To arrest continuing declines, protective measures need to be urgently implemented. Concomitantly, the house farming of the Edible-nest Swiftlet, as has been established in Indonesia, needs to be developed as an ex-situ conservation measure in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.Calamus thwaitesii Becc. is a potentially useful rattan found in the Western Ghats of India and Sri Lanka. The wild stock of this rattan species is greatly diminished due to overexploitation for the furniture industry and increasingly rare. Genetic diversity was estimated in 80 samples representing eight populations from the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. RAPDs generated a total of 120 markers with 10 decamer primers, of which 85% were found to be polymorphic. The percentage of polymorphic loci varied from 40.00 to 60.83 and genetic distance between populations ranged from 0.0332 to 0.2777. Among the analysed populations, Goa was found to be genetically superior followed by Achenkovil, Sinharaja and Talakkaveri. Majority of the genetic diversity was distributed within populations (70.79%) and only (29.21%) among populations. Genetic relationships estimated by the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averaging (UPGMA) cluster analysis and principal co-ordinate analysis failed to separate Indian and Sri Lankan populations geographically into two distinct groups.The view that biodiversity-rich areas partially or largely managed by local residents, sometimes referred to as community-conserved areas (CCAs), can be effective in biological conservation has gained considerable ground over the past decade. In this paper, we review available scientific information on the conservation effectiveness of such areas globally. We compiled studies undertaken during the last 5\\xa0years (2004–2009) that use quantifiable ecological attributes to: (1) compare CCAs with strictly protected areas (SPAs); (2) compare CCAs with open-access ecosystems and (3) study trends in biological attributes of CCAs over time. We found that there were few consistent differences in diversity/species richness of flora or fauna protected under the two types of management or in deforestation rates. However, CCAs tend to harbour a species complement distinct from that of SPAs and show lowered abundances of monitored taxa that are of conservation importance. CCAs conserve biological values more effectively than open-access areas. Also, biological values tend to decline in CCAs over time. We conclude that CCAs could represent a significant improvement over open-access areas in terms of conservation effectiveness, yet fall short of the needs of comprehensive biological conservation. While extremely few studies have been undertaken in India, the trends seen largely concur with global ones. This review, based on a limited sample size, is only a beginning, and is expected to serve as an invitation for further research to address both the question of biological effectiveness of diverse forest governance regimes as well as the socio-economic, demographic and institutional reasons underlying these differences.The southwestern Ghats region of the Indian Peninsula is unique for its extant endemic rainforest flora supported by high rainfall throughout the year. The record of tropical rainforest corresponding to the dynamic series of Pleistocene interglacial/glacial cycles is poorly known from peninsular India. This communication discusses the palynological study of organic matter (OM) deposits (>40\\xa0ka BP) in two well sections (Chaganachery, Kerala) from the Indian Peninsula (west coast). A rich archive of tropical rainforest pollen/spores and marine dinoflagellate cysts indicates anoxic fluvio-marine/estuarine depositional environments during warmer climates with an intensified Asian monsoon. The geochemical fingerprinting of glass shards indicates the presence of Youngest Toba ash of ∼74\\xa0ka from northern Sumatra, and therefore establishes a time-controlled stratigraphy. Thus, the depositional time period of the OM is related to the sea level highstand of Marine Isotopic Stage 5.1 (∼80\\xa0ka) which was the host to the YTT shards. The Late Quaternary pollen/spores diversity suggests that the modern climatic conditions in the southwestern Ghats have facilitated the conservation of moist evergreen rainforest and dry/moist deciduous forest. The pollen grains show its lineage with the extant flora and some of the fossil pollen recorded during the mesic Tertiary period from the Indian peninsula. Thus, it appears that the tropical rainforest survived here as ‘Plant Refugia’ in xeric (glacial) Quaternary periods, perhaps as riparian vegetation, and was rejuvenated during the Holocene as modern extant flora.Turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) is an industrially important plant used for production of curcumin, oleoresin and essential oil. In the present study we examined the genetic diversity among turmeric accessions from 10 different agro-climatic regions comprising 5 cultivars and 55 accessions. Two DNA-based molecular marker techniques, viz., random amplified polymorphism DNA (RAPD) and inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) were used to assess the genetic diversity in turmeric genotypes. A total of 17 polymorphic primers (11 RAPDs and 6 ISSRs) were used in this study. RAPD analysis of 60 genotypes yielded 94 fragments of which 75 were polymorphic with an average of 6.83 polymorphic fragments per primer. Number of amplified fragments with RAPD primers ranged from 3 to 13 with the size of amplicons ranging from 230 to 3000\\xa0bp in size. The polymorphism ranged from 45 to 100 with an average of 91.4%. The 6 ISSR primers produced 66 bands across 60 genotypes of which 52 were polymorphic with an average of 8.6 polymorphic fragments per primer. The number of amplified bands varied from 1 to 14 with size of amplicons ranging from 200 to 2000\\xa0bp. The percentage of polymorphism using ISSR primers ranged from 83 to 100 with an average of 95.4%. Nei\\'s dendrogram for 60 samples using both RAPD and ISSR markers demonstrated an extent of 62% correlation between the genetic similarity and geographical location. The result of Nei\\'s genetic diversity (H) generated from the POP gene analysis shows relatively low genetic diversity in turmeric accessions of South eastern ghat (P7), Western undulating zone (P8) with 0.181 and 0.199 value whereas highest genetic diversity (0.257) has been observed in Western central table land (P9). Knowledge on the genetic diversity of turmeric from different agro-climatic regions can be used to future breeding programs for increased curcumin, oleoresin and essential oil production to meet the ever-increasing demand of turmeric for industrial and pharmaceutical uses.Rohitukine, a chromane alkaloid, is a precursor of flavopiridol, a promising anti-cancer compound. Currently in Phase III clinical trials, flavopiridol is a potent inhibitor of several cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Rohitukine was first reported from Amoora rohituka (0.083% dry weight) followed by that in Dysoxylum binectariferum (0.9% dry weight), both belonging to the family Meliaceae. Here, we report incredibly high yields of rohitukine (7% dry weight) in trees of D. binectariferum from the Western Ghats, India. Crude extracts of the tree were found to be highly effective against ovarian and breast cancer lines tested.Across the globe, catch-and-release (C&R) angling represents a leisure activity indulged by millions. The practice of C&R is commonly advocated by conservation managers because of its potential to protect local fish populations from a range of anthropogenic threats, including over-fishing. In India, C&R angling in fresh waters has a history dating back to colonial times. Despite this, little is known about the current state of the sector. To address this, an online web-based survey was conducted to target C&R anglers who fish in Indian rivers to assess their knowledge, attitudes and perceptions relating to the status of India\\'s freshwater C&R fisheries. From a total of 148 responses, factors such as angling quality (score of 4.6/5.0); aesthetics of surroundings (4.6/5.0), presence of other wildlife (4.4/5.0), fishery management practices (4.6/5.0) and socioeconomic benefits (4.4/5.0) were evaluated. Over 65% (n\\xa0=\\xa0148) of the anglers reported an observed decrease in the quality of fishing (e.g. a reduction in the size and/or numbers of fish available for capture). Respondents also considered deforestation (score of 4.2/5.0), water abstraction (4.4/5.0), pollution (4.4/5.0), hydropower projects (4.2/5.0) and destructive fishing techniques (4.7/5.0) as factors which threaten both the habitat and species they target. C&R practitioners were largely united regarding the benefits and willingness to contribute both their time and financial input to support conservation initiatives (score of 4.7/5.0). The current study provides the first overview of the status of C&R angling in India and explores challenges, opportunities, and priorities for future resource management.The species richness and density of lianas (woody vines) in tropical forests is determined by various abiotic and biotic factors. Factors such as altitude, forest patch size and the degree of forest disturbance are known to exert strong influences on liana species richness and density. We investigated how liana species richness and density were concurrently influenced by altitude (1700–2360\\xa0m), forest patch size, forest patch location (edge or interior) and disturbance intensity in the tropical montane evergreen forests, of the Nilgiri and Palni hills, Western Ghats, southern India. All woody lianas (≥1\\xa0cm dbh) were enumerated in plots of 30\\xa0×\\xa030\\xa0m in small, medium and large forest patches, which were located along an altitudinal gradient ranging from 1700 to 2360\\xa0m. A total of 1980 individual lianas were recorded, belonging to 45 species, 32 genera and 21 families, from a total sampling area of 13.86\\xa0ha (across 154 plots). Liana species richness and density decreased significantly with increasing altitude and increased with increasing forest patch size. Within forest patches, the proportion of forest edge or interior habitat influenced liana distribution and succession especially when compared across the patch size categories. Liana species richness and density also varied along the altitudinal gradient when examined using eco-physiological guilds (i.e. shade tolerance, dispersal mode and climbing mechanism). The species richness and density of lianas within these ecological guilds responded negatively to increasing altitude and positively to increasing patch size and additionally displayed differing sensitivities to forest disturbance. Importantly, the degree of forest disturbance significantly altered the relationship between liana species richness and density to increasing altitude and patches size, and as such is likely the primary influence on liana response to montane forest succession. Our findings suggest that managing forest disturbance in the examined montane forests would assist in conserving local liana diversity across the examined altitudinal range.A simple and efficient method has been developed for rapid regeneration of plantlets via adventitious bud differentiation on mature seeds of Garcinia indica (Thouars) Choisy, a medicinally important facultative apomictic tropical tree species. High frequency direct shoot proliferation was induced in seed segments cultured on Murashige and Skoog\\'s medium supplemented with cytokinins (BAP, kinetin and TDZ) alone and in combination with auxin (NAA). Amongst the various combinations used, BAP proved to be the most effective. Multiple shoots formed within 4–5 weeks of culture. The shoot forming capacity of the seeds was influenced by the BAP concentration tested (5–50\\xa0μM) and optimal response was observed at different concentrations (12.5–50\\xa0μM) in different genotypes investigated. Significant differences were recorded in terms of percent response (27.78–100%) as well as average number of shoots per explant (3.49–57.67) among the four genotypes investigated. Elongation of the induced shoots was achieved on MS basal medium containing 0.2% activated charcoal. The induction medium had a profound effect on rate of bud elongation with shoots induced on lower concentrations of BAP showing as much as four-fold elongation within 4 weeks. Proliferating shoot cultures were established by repeatedly subculturing the shoot nodes on MS medium supplemented with 5\\xa0μM BAP. Maximum rooting (91.66%) occurred in shoots cultured on half-strength MS medium supplemented with 10\\xa0μM IBA. The plantlets were successfully transferred to soil after hardening; the time period from initiation of shoot buds to transplantation being 15–17 weeks. For in vitro conservation, the shoot cultures were maintained on medium supplemented with 0.5\\xa0μM BAP and the subculture duration could be enhanced up to maximum of 11 months.In an era of human activities, global environmental changes, habitat loss and species extinction, conservation strategies are a crucial step toward minimizing biodiversity loss. For instance, oceans acidification and land use are intensifying in many places with negative and often irreversible consequences for biodiversity. Biodiversity hotspots, despite some criticism, have become a tool for setting conservation priorities and play an important role in decision-making for cost-effective strategies to preserve biodiversity in terrestrial and, to some extent, marine ecosystems. This area-based approach can be applied to any geographical scale and it is considered to be one of the best approaches for maintaining a large proportion of the world’s biological diversity. However, delineating hotspots includes quantitative criteria along with subjective considerations and the risk is to neglect areas, such as coldspots, with other types of conservation value. Nowadays, it is widely acknowledged that biodiversity is much more than just the number of species in a region and a conservation strategy cannot be based merely on the number of taxa present in an ecosystem. Therefore, the idea that strongly emerges is the need to reconsider conservation priorities and to go toward an interdisciplinary approach through the creation of science-policy partnerships.Gaultheria (Ericaceae), a perennial woody genus, comprises of approximately 200 species, is distributed in the temperate and tropical regions of the world. Although majority of them are diploids with basic chromosome number of n\\xa0=\\xa011, some species are tetraploid or hexaploid. The genus is known for Gaultheria procumbens and Gaultheria fragrantissima for the production of “oil of wintergreen” which is used for antimicrobial, insecticidal, and antioxidant properties, and hence these two species have been investigated relatively more than other species. Most importantly, the plants of this genus contain higher levels of salicylic acid within the plant kingdom. Only limited information is available on biotechnological aspects; other investigations have however, concentrated on identification and quantification of chemical compounds from the genus at the species level, or to evaluate their pharmacological activities. Being vulnerable and economically important due to rich source of natural salicylic acid, G. fragrantissima (Wall.) has drawn much attention in the recent times, and hence there is an urgent need for biotechnological interventions not only for its conservation but also for bioprospecting its genome resources. Studies on phytochemical and pharmacological characteristics have been recently reviewed, therefore in this communication, an attempt has been made to depict the recent advances in various biotechnological aspects aimed for the conservation and varietal improvement of G. fragrantissima.The rheophilous tadpoles of the rare and endangered Purple frog, Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis (Biju and Bossuyt, 2003), have suctorial mouthparts that enable them to occupy a very unique microhabitat within torrential streams. In this study, we examined the influence of four stream habitat variables, i.e. water flow velocity, slope of substrate, depth of water column and water temperature, on the distribution and abundance of these tadpoles. A total of 204 measurements were recorded for all the four variables in 68 marked grids along a 100 m section of two selected streams. Statistical analysis showed that water flow velocity was the best predictor for abundance of tadpoles in both streams. When the number of tadpoles was modeled as a function of each environmental variable, the relationship ranged from linear (w.r.t water flow velocity and water temperature) to unimodal humped curves (w.r.t slope of substrate and depth of water column). The results were further assessed with respect to distribution and behavioral observations of the tadpoles in the streams as well as to the threat posed by dams and reservoirs on tadpole microhabitats.In India, sacred groves have been considered the forested abodes of one or multiple deities and are often managed by communal governance systems. As land development has progressed, the population surrounding these and other green spaces has changed, and responsibility for their protection has shifted to the bureaucracies that manage urban environments. The sacred grove now means different things to different people, and the value of its protection is increasingly difficult to characterize. In this context, we study individual preferences for sacred groves and non-forested temples along an urbanization gradient –defined by land use– in rural locales near the megacity of Delhi, informed by the theoretical perspective of Sanskritization. We use revealed and stated preference data that includes information on visits to forests and worship sites, weighting for relevant forest characteristics, and socio-demographic factors related to culture. Respondents generally place higher value on sacred groves than on non-sacred green space, but more urbanized and sanskritized individuals exhibit higher valuations for non-forested temples and conservation of urban green space. Taken together, these results suggest a potential increase in the perception of non-sacred and non-use forest value among urbanized respondents.Nepal is located in the central part of the greater Himalayan range with a unique series of mountain chains formed by recent mountain building geological events. As one of the youngest mountains in the world it contributes to diversity of plants and also provided barriers to and corridors through which plants migrated during the ice ages. The higher altitudinal variation with the high mountains, deep river valleys and lowland plains combine with the effects of the summer monsoon and dry winter result with an extraordinary diversity of ecosystems including flora and fauna in a relatively small land area. The existing checklists for Nepal record some 6000 species of flowering plants and about 530 ferns. However, the botanical experts estimate that numbers may go up to 7000 when the poorly known remote regions are fully explored. The information on plant endemism in Nepal Himalaya is not adequately known as Nepal is still struggling to complete long awaited Flora of Nepal project. Endemic species are confined to specific areas and are the first to be affected by land use and other global changes. We sought to explore the spatial distribution of endemic plant species in Nepal in relation to the consequences associated with climatic and geologic changes over time in the region with the help of published literature. It was found that the endemism showed marked spatial variation between open moist habitat and dry inner valleys, the former with higher endemism. The updated records showed 312 flowering plant species to be endemic to Nepal with higher endemism around the elevation of 3800–4200\\xa0m at sea level. The recent human population explosion, intensified deforestation, habitat fragmentation and modern day environmental changes are posing greater threats to endemic plant in Nepal. The conservation status and threats to these peculiar species are unknown. Nevertheless, environmental degradation and high poverty rates create a potent mix of threats to biodiversity in this landscape.This paper describes how a green energy surplus region changed over the years to a thermal energy-mix, driven by environmentalist forces’ strong opposition to Hydro-Electric Power Projects (HEPPs) in Kerala, India. The specific instance of the proposed Athirappilly HEPP is discussed against the background of the opposition of environmentalists and other sympathetic associations. The strong opposition to HEPPs in specific local contexts has led to increased emissions in other places. The tenets of Energy Justice – distributional, procedural, recognition and cosmopolitan – have been challenged by the environmentalists’ movement against the Athirappilly HEPP. The inherent conflicts between Environment Law and Climate Law on the one hand and the principles of Energy Justice and Law on the other are pointed out. The concept of “Power-Environ” is introduced and characterized, and its relation to Energy Justice and Law is explored in the policy context. The concept proposed here serves as a foundation for realizing parsimonious and effective representation of the opposition to HEPPs, and ushering Energy Justice and Law. The use of this concept, as an integrated whole founded on the principles of Energy Justice and Law, should facilitate balanced policy-making in the Energy sector, especially in India and hopefully across the world too.Soil erosion contributes negatively to agricultural production, quality of source water for drinking, ecosystem health in land and aquatic environments, and aesthetic value of landscapes. Approaches to understand the spatial variability of erosion severity are important for improving landuse management. This study uses the Kelani river basin in Sri Lanka as the study area to assess erosion severity using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model supported by a GIS system. Erosion severity across the river basin was estimated using RUSLE, a Digital Elevation Model (15\\u202f×\\u202f15\\u202fm), twenty years rainfall data at 14 rain gauge stations across the basin, landuse and land cover, and soil maps and cropping factors. The estimated average annual soil loss in Kelani river basin varied from zero to 103.7\\u202ft ha-1\\u202fyr−1, with a mean annual soil loss estimated at 10.9\\u202ft ha−1 yr−1. About 70% of the river basin area was identified with low to moderate erosion severity (<12\\u202ft ha−1\\u202fyr−1) indicating that erosion control measures are urgently needed to ensure a sustainable ecosystem in the Kelani river basin, which in turn, is connected with the quality of life of over 5 million people. Use of this severity information developed with RUSLE along with its individual parameters can help to design landuse management practices. This effort can be further refined by analyzing RUSLE results along with Kelani river sub-basins level real time erosion estimations as a monitoring measure for conservation practices.The quantitative liana inventories made in five peninsular Indian independent forest sites, distributed in the Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats and on the Coromandel coast, were examined particularly with reference to site altitude and forest stature. Liana diversity totaled 148 species in 101 genera of 47 families, in a total sample of 47\\xa0ha. The coefficient of variability in species distribution among the five sites was used to identify an oligarchy in liana species by taking 55 abundant species from the species pool. Ordination analysis, based on presence–absence as well as relative density of liana species indicated a geographical differentiation among the five sites in both the ordinations with respect to site altitude. Liana density (stems>1.6\\xa0cm diameter) decreased with increasing altitude, whereas richness was highest at intermediate elevations. The mean liana density across the forest sites showed a weak negative correlation with forest stature. The lianas encountered in the five study sites fell under six climber types, of which twining was the chief climbing mechanism, both in terms of species diversity and density, and tendril climbers were more abundant in dry evergreen forests than in the wet evergreen forests. In liana diaspore dispersal modes, the majority of evergreen forest species possessed animal dispersal guilds, whereas wind-dispersal was prevalent in semi-evergreen and dry evergreen forests.There is an urgent need for techniques to rapidly and periodically measure biodiversity and ecosystem services over large landscapes. Conventional vegetation classification and mapping approaches are based on discrete arbitrary classes which do not capture gradual changes in forest type (and corresponding biodiversity and ecosystem services values) from site to site. We developed a simple multi-date NDVI based Mahalanobis distance measure (called eco-climatic distance) that quantifies forest type variability across a moisture gradient for complex tropical forested landscapes on a single ecologically interpretable, continuous scale. This Mahalanobis distance, unlike other distance measures takes into account the variability in the reference class and shared information amongst bands as it is based on the covariance matrix, and therefore is most useful to summarize ecological distance of a pixel to a reference class in multi-band remotely sensed space In this study we successfully apply this measure as a surrogate for tree biodiversity and ecosystem services at two nested scales for the Western Ghats Bio-diversity hotspot. Data from over 500 tree-plots and forest type maps was used to test the ability of this remotely sensed distance to be a surrogate for abundance based tree-species compositional turn-over and as a continuous measure of forest type and ecosystem services. Our results suggest a strong but scale dependant relationship between the remotely-sensed distance measure and floristic distance between plots. The multi-date NDVI distance measure emerges as very good quantitative surrogate for forest type and is a useful complement to existing forest classification systems. This surrogate quantifies forest type variability on a single, continuous quantitative scale and has important applications in conservation planning and mapping and monitoring of hydrologic and carbon storage and sequestration services.Rauvolfia species are important medicinal plants due to the presence of bioactive indole alkaloids, especially reserpine. Reserpine content in the roots of six Rauvolfia species (R. hookeri, R. micrantha, R. serpentina, R. tetraphylla, R. verticillata, and R. vomitoria), were detected by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrapole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI-QToF-MS/MS) and estimated by validated high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) method. Reserpine has positively been identified in the crude alkaloid extracts through HPLC–ESI-QToF-MS/MS method by exact mass, isotopic peak pattern, tandem mass fragmentation pattern, and with authentic standard match. Excellent separation of reserpine was achieved in HPTLC using the solvent system hexane:acetone:methanol (6:3.5:0.5, v/v). The HPTLC estimation method was validated in terms of linearity, specificity, detection limit, quantitation limit, precision, accuracy, and repeatability. Among the six Rauvolfia species, reserpine content was highest in the exotic species R. vomitoria (689.5\\xa0μg/g, dry wt.), while among the five Indian species the highest reserpine content was for R. tetraphylla (450.7\\xa0μg/g, dry wt.). In the most common Indian Rauvolfia species, R. serpentina, the reserpine content was comparatively low (254.8\\xa0μg/g, dry wt.). The endemic species R. micrantha possesses significant quantity of reserpine (422.1\\xa0μg/g, dry wt.), making it a potential candidate for developing as a source of reserpine, replacing R. serpentina and R. tetraphylla that are endangered due to over exploitation.Embelia ribes Burm. f. belongs to the family Myrsinaceae found in hilly parts of India up to 1500 m. elevation from outer Himalayas to Western Ghats. It is an endangered medicinal plant valued for its digestive, carminative, anthelmintic and laxative property since time immemorial. It is also used in diabetes, heart related problems, nerval disorders, cancerous tumors and liver disorders. The seeds are also used for wound healing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and contraceptive activity. Due to over exploitation of this plant it is reported in red list data book as vulnerable [Ravikumar & Ved 2000]. Therefore an overview of this plant on pharmacognosy, pharmacology, safety and toxicity is presented below along with HPLC details of Embelin the active constituent of the seeds.Camptothecine (CPT), a quinoline alkaloid, is a potent inhibitor of eukaryotic topoisomerase I. Because of this activity, several semi-synthetic derivatives of CPT are in clinical use against ovarian and small lung cancers. Together with its derivatives, CPT is the third largest anti-cancer drug in the world market. CPT is produced by several plant species belonging to the Asterid clade. In the recent past, several studies have reported the production of CPT by endophytic fungal associates of some of these plant species. In this paper, we report the production of CPT by endophytic bacteria isolated from Miquelia dentata Bedd. (Icacinaceae). Besides CPT, the bacteria also produced 9-methoxy CPT (9-MeO-CPT), in culture, independent of the host tissue. The chemical nature of CPT and 9-MeO-CPT was determined by LC–MS and ESI-MS/MS analysis, and was shown to be similar to that produced by the host tissue. One of the bacterial isolates examined, showed indications of attenuation of CPT production through sub-culture. This is the first report of production of CPT by endophytic bacteria. The identity of the bacteria was ascertained by Gram staining and 16s rRNA sequencing. We discuss the possible mechanisms that might be involved in the synthesis of CPT by endophytic bacteria.Soil erosion is a serious problem arising from agricultural intensification, land degradation and other anthropogenic activities. Assessment of soil erosion is useful in planning and conservation works in a watershed or basin. Modelling can provide a quantitative and consistent approach to estimate soil erosion and sediment yield under a wide range of conditions. In the present study, the soil loss model, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with GIS has been used to estimate soil loss in the Nethravathi Basin located in the southwestern part of India. The Nethravathi Basin is a tropical coastal humid area having a drainage area of 3128\\xa0km2 up to the gauging station. The parameters of RUSLE model were estimated using remote sensing data and the erosion probability zones were determined using GIS. The estimated rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, topographic and crop management factors range from 2948.16 to 4711.4\\xa0MJ/mm·ha−1hr−1/year, 0.10 to 0.44\\xa0t\\xa0ha−1·MJ−1·mm−1, 0 to 92,774 and 0 to 0.63 respectively. The results indicate that the estimated total annual potential soil loss of about 473,339\\xa0t/yr is comparable with the measured sediment of 441,870\\xa0t/yr during the water year 2002–2003. The predicted soil erosion rate due to increase in agricultural area is about 14,673.5\\xa0t/yr. The probability zone map has been derived by the weighted overlay index method indicate that the major portion of the study area comes under low probability zone and only a small portion comes under high and very high probability zone. The results can certainly aid in implementation of soil management and conservation practices to reduce the soil erosion in the Nethravathi Basin.Protected areas are essential for both conservation of biodiversity and provisioning of dynamic ecosystem services. In recent years, invasive plant species have had devastating impacts on the sustenance of natural habitat for the in-situ conservation of threatened species. In the present study, we investigated the distribution pattern of Chromolaena odorata and Mikania micrantha and factors governing their spread in the grassland of Manas National Park. We carried out extensive field sampling and modeled the distribution of invasives using a suite of algorithms. Model predictions differed with respect to AUC, sensitivity, specificity and TSS range, largely in classification performance. Final risk maps were produced averaging the model outputs of Random Forest and MaxEnt for both the species. Subsequently, we also emphasized that the niche/SDM modelling studies should instigate by testing a suite of algorithms for predictive ability under the specific conditions of the study since no single optimization approach would be best under all circumstances. Proximity to the road and human settlement, elevation, fire occurrence and precipitation of driest quarter were the key predictors for both the invasive. The potential area invaded by the C. odorata was 74.87\\u202fsq.\\u202fkm and M. micarantha 81.82\\u202fsq.\\u202fkm, and a high degree of overlap found between the distributions of both the species. Invasion risk maps can be used as an early detection tool for the management of invasive species, which could help in minimizing the ecological significance and economic cost of invasions. The findings of the present study will help the forest authorities to manage, take the necessary steps in the identified area to chalk out a comprehensive strategy for control of invasive.An efficient protocol for the mass propagation of Torenia bicolor using internode derived callus organogenesis has been described. The optimum callusing was observed when internode explants were cultured on MS medium augmented with 4.0\\xa0μM 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2, 4-D) and 0.5\\xa0μM kinetin (Kn). The calli were subcultured on MS medium supplemented with various concentrations of N6-benzylaminopurine (BA; 1.0-5.0\\xa0μM) or Kn (1.0-5.0\\xa0μM) alone or in combination with naphthalene acetic acid (NAA; 0.5-1.5\\xa0μM) for shoot regeneration. The highest shoot regeneration in terms of percent response (100%) and number of shoots (89.3) was observed on MS medium supplemented with 4.0\\xa0μM BA and 1.0\\xa0μM NAA. The best rooting was observed on half strength MS medium augmented with 0.6\\xa0μM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). On this medium, 100% shoots rooted with an average number of 6.8 roots per shoot. The rooted shoots were transplanted to soil and acclimatized successfully. Of the 80 plants transplanted to soil 72 survived. Inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis clearly indicated that callus derived plants of T. bicolor resembled the parent plant at the genetic level. The protocol described here could be used for the mass multiplication and conservation of this endemic plant.Planning and management decisions concerning forest resources require the integration of large volumes of disparate information from numerous sources, which in turn, need different techniques and tools. The present work attempts to develop an integrated range management decision support system (IRMDSS) to provide an interactive decision support tool for forest planners in the Western Ghats of India, which is one of the ecologically important areas of the Earth. The IRMDSS interface combines individual technologies such as remote sensing, a geographic information system (GIS) and a knowledge based system. The prototype IRMDSS was developed by customizing arcview gis software and coupling it other software using dynamic link libraries. The IRMDSS prototype provides forest planners and managers a better means of organizing, accessing, and evaluating a wide range of information and alternative strategies for effective forest planning and management in the study area.In the wet forest regions of southwest Sri Lanka and the Western Ghats, India, Pinus caribaea was a common tree species for reforestation on public lands that were originally cleared of native forest for agriculture but subsequently succeeded to fire tolerant grasses and ferns. Much of this reforestation occurred during the 1970s and 1980s. The ecological literature suggests that in many temperate broadleaf forest regions pine is an important component of early succession on old fields, beneath which second growth hardwood can establish and eventually dominate. More recent studies have demonstrated the establishment of native rain forest regeneration beneath a variety of exotic tree plantations. We review nearly twenty-five years of research on this topic for South Asia through a series of studies done in southwest Sri Lanka. Results demonstrate that native species recruitment of both pioneers and site generalist late-successional trees grow well beneath exotic pine plantations. Diversity and density increase from plantation interior to edge. Protection from groundstory fire is the single most important component of promoting regeneration recruitment beneath pine. Establishing late-successional site and dispersal restricted species requires planting beneath pine rather than reliance on natural establishment. Best establishment and growth occur in openings where rows of canopy pine have been removed. Species considered for planting comprise the major late-successional canopy tree species of the forest in the genera Dipterocarpus, Shorea (Dipterocarpaceae) and Mesua (Clusiaceae). Native species that produce non-timber forest products (NTFP) need to be planted with best results in canopy openings. The most valuable NTFP’s comprise a sugar palm (Caryota urens), rattan (Calamus spp.) and a medicinal liana (Coscinium fenestratum). Financial analyses reveal that pine plantations that are enrichment planted and cultivated with rain forest timber and non-timber species can provide superior economic benefits as compared to land cultivated singly for tea.Camptothecin and 10-hydroxycamptothecin are two important precursors for the synthesis of the clinically useful anticancer drugs, topotecan and irinotecan. In recent years, efforts have been made to identify novel plant and endophytic fungal sources of camptothecin and 10-hydroxycamptothecin. In this study we have isolated endophytic fungi strains from Apodytes dimidiata (Icacinaceae), a medium sized tree from the Western Ghats, India. The fungi were identified as Fusarium solani using both ITS rDNA sequencing and spore morphology. Two strains, MTCC 9667 and MTCC 9668 were isolated, both of which produced camptothecin and 9-methoxycamptothecin in their mycelia; one of the strains, MTCC 9668 also produced 10-hydroxycamptothecin, though in small amounts. The yields of camptothecin in MTCC 9667 and MTCC 9668 were 37 and 53\\xa0μg/100\\xa0g, respectively, after 4\\xa0days of incubation in broth culture. The yields of 10-hydroxycamptothecin and 9-methoxycamptothecin in MTCC 9668 were 8.2 and 44.9\\xa0μg/100\\xa0g, respectively. Further research in optimizing the culture conditions of these fungal strains might permit their application for the production of camptothecin and 10-hydroxycamptothecin.The last 6000 years are of particular interest to the understanding of the Earth System because the boundary conditions of the climate system did not change dramatically (in comparison to larger glacial–interglacial changes), and because abundant, detailed regional palaeoclimatic proxy records cover this period. Here, we present fossil pollen data and examine their climatic interpretation based on a 200-cm-deep trenched sedimentary profile from Mahanadi river side, located near the Barpahar hillock of Bargarh District, Odisha, which is influenced by the South-west and North-east monsoon. The 5840\\xa0y chronology of the sediment core is based on three 14C dates on soil samples. During 5840–4380\\xa0BP, dense tropical mixed deciduous forest consisting of Madhuca, Syzygium and Acacia flourished in the region along with Rhizophora under a warm and humid climate governed by high monsoonal activity. This phase of climate is associated with the Holocene Climatic Optimum which falls within the temporal range of 8000–5000\\xa0BP. Subsequently, an increase in humidity was discerned between 4380 and 3230\\xa0BP, as evident by increase in forest elements, under warm and relatively humid climate in response to an increased monsoon. The climate during 3230–1860\\xa0BP was mild and in general less humid than today. This climate event was inevitably influenced by a notable global cold event 4200 years ago, which is synchronous with the collapse of the world\\'s first human empire in Mesopotamia. After this event, there was a return of more humid climate from 1860 to 1300\\xa0BP, marked by high values of Potamogeton, Myriophyllum, Nymphoides, and fungal and trilete fern spores. This is further supported by the presence of Rhizophora and Sonneratia indicating high precipitation under the influence of coastal habitation. A striking signal of the Little Ice age (LIA) was observed since 1300\\xa0BP when the climate became relatively dry, as recognized in a sudden decline in major arboreals, along with high frequency of occurrence of dry herbs. This changing pattern of humidity was also reflected in the proportions of marshy/aquatic taxa, as well as ruderal taxa which is a result of human impact. The study will be helpful to display the palaeovegetation and climate in the region between Bengal and the Ganga plain.Ecohydrological modelling and prescribing environmental flows (e-flows) is significant in the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) practice. However, for many river basins, there is lack of data on ecosystems and on the relationships between e-flows and ecosystem functioning. This lack of sufficient ecosystem data is mostly addressed in ecohydrological modelling by using hydrological metrics as surrogates of river ecosystem. In this study, we are demonstrating how it helps e-flows modelling and real-life management decisions underway with respect to Inter-basin Water Transfer (IBWT) projects. Desktop model ‘Flow Health’ is used here to design e-flows regime for Chalakkudi Sub-basin in Southern Peninsular India. Chalakkudi Sub-basin is over abstracted with six large dams built as components of the Parambikulam Aliyar Project (PAP), Asia\\'s largest IBWT network. The monthly e-flow regimes required to maintain alternate levels of ecosystem conservation are estimated in this paper. The additional flood flow volume required for these alternate levels is also discussed. The results are useful in the stakeholder engagement process for informed decision-making on e-flows and redefining the IBWT operations within a broad framework of IWRM.Application of remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) as a tool has assumed an immense significance in habitat suitability modelling for various wildlife species and now a days these are widely used in conservation biology and wildlife management.This paper evaluates habitat suitability for tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) in Chandoli National Park, India. This research provides information about potential areas that can be declared as Tiger Reserve, a federal designation of protection. Habitat evaluation was completed in the Chandoli National Park (17° 04′ 00″ N to 17° 19′ 54″ N and 73° 40′ 43″ E to 73° 53′ 09″ E) using habitat suitability index (HSI). Remotely sensed data of satellite IRS-P6, LISS-III of 25th February 2005 was procured from National Remote Sensing Agency, India. The satellite imagery data was digitally processed and collateral data were generated from topographic maps in a GIS framework. Various layers of different variables such as landuse land cover, forest density, measures of proximity to disturbances and water resources and a digital terrain model were created based on ground truthing. These layers, GPS location of animal\\'s presence and “binomial multiple logistic regression (BMLR)” techniques were integrated in a GIS environment for the HSI modelling.Results indicate that approximately 160.48\\xa0km2 (55%) of the forest of Chandoli National Park is highly suitable for herbivores population, and 176.52\\xa0km2 (50%) of the Park is suitable for tigers. Therefore, this study concludes that forest areas within the Chandoli National Park are appropriate for consideration as Tiger Reserve.Furthermore, the identification and mapping of wildlife corridors and other forest patches lying in between neighboring protected area like Koyana sanctuary, suggests that these region of Sahyadri range of Western Ghats should be included into the proposed Tiger Reserve. This will be a benefit for tigers, as tigers require larger and least disturbed forest habitats for establishing and maintaining their high-density population. Fortunately, in May 2008 the Government of India declared Chandoli NP as tiger reserve. Thus declaration of Chandoli National Park as a Tiger Reserve reflects that the habitat suitability model developed by us for tiger was not only statistically sound but also has potential to be considered while taking any decision regarding wildlife habitat management.In Eravikulam National Park, India, Nilgiri tahr Hemitragus hylocrius frequent the fringes of the grass-covered plateau. The two main types of grassland utilised by tahr were dominated by Eulalia phaeothrix and Andropogon polyptichus.The total wild population of Nilgiri tahr is about 2200. Available evidence suggests that the three largest populations have remained approximately stable in recent years. Annual mortality at Eravikulam NP was estimated to be 44–52% for young, 31–37% for yearlings, and 17–24% for adults. Life expectancy at birth was estimated at 3–3·5 years. There was evidence for mortality incurred by predation, disease, accidents, injury during intraspecific combat, and thermal stress.Relevant to conservation are the short life expectancy of Nilgiri tahr; the need for comparable information on size and structure of all extant populations; and the effect of weather patterns on the temporal distribution of births and census results.ObjectivePresent study reports the various factors affecting somatic embryogenesis and in\\xa0vitro flowering in Hybanthus enneaspermus (L.) F. Muell.MethodsThe effect of the salts strength of Murashige and Skoog\\'s (MS) medium, concentration of sucrose and plant growth regulators were analyzed for the induction of direct somatic embryogenesis using nodal segments as explants.ResultsHigh frequency of somatic embryogenesis was reported on full strength MS medium (with 3% sucrose) and additives supplemented with 0.5\\xa0mg/L 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 0.25\\xa0mg/L indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Maximum somatic embryos (207.0\\xa0±\\xa04.2) were germinated on 1/2 strength MS medium augmented with 0.5\\xa0mg/L BAP. Microscopic studies revealed the typical developmental patterns in somatic embryogenesis from globular to heart-shaped and followed by bipolar torpedo-shaped somatic embryos from nodal explants. The plantlets raised from the somatic embryos resulted in flowering on full strength MS medium augmented with 1.0\\xa0mg/L each of BAP and Kinetin (Kin)\\xa0+\\xa00.5\\xa0mg/L IAA at 50\\xa0μmol/(m2·s) SFPD for 13\\xa0h/d photoperiod. About 92% plantlets were successfully acclimatized in the greenhouse. Field transferred plants exhibit normal flowering and fruit setting.ConclusionsThe study could be exploited for large scale propagation of true to type plants as conservation strategies of this rare and endemic medicinal plant.gies to identify individual animals, follow their movements, identify and locate animal and plant species, and assess the status of their habitats remotely have become better, faster, and cheaper as threats to the survival of species are increasing. New technologies alone do not save species, and new data create new problems. For example, improving technologies alone cannot prevent poaching: solutions require providing appropriate tools to the right people. Habitat loss is another driver: the challenge here is to connect existing sophisticated remote sensing with species occurrence data to predict where species remain. Other challenges include assembling a wider public to crowdsource data, managing the massive quantities of data generated, and developing solutions to rapidly emerging threats.Biological invasions by alien non-indigenous species are one of the major problems of the present era which impose massive environmental and socio-economic costs. In India about 40% of the floral species have long been recognized to be aliens, but the need for priority conservation efforts has only been felt since the turn of the century. Thus, it is now of utmost importance to predict the potential distribution of invasive alien species and identify suitable environmental conditions that allow the species to spread rapidly.The invasive plant Mikania micrantha was chosen as the test species. Native occurrence records (longitude and latitude) were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). For Indian occurrences, GBIF records were supplemented with occurrences from herbaria label data and information gathered from published literature. Nineteen climatic variables were obtained from World-Clim databse.To predict the potential distribution, species distribution models (SDMs) were built by using logistic regression and the climatic variables were chosen by using two cross-validated regularization methods induced by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) and the ridge penalty function. This approach has twofold benefits; it deals with the multicollinearity problem efficiently and selects the raw environmental covariates. Fβ-score was utilized to measure the models’ performance. Combining the data from both native and alien ranges, seven environmental predictors were selected using four different background choices. Using lasso penalty, mean diurnal range (mean of monthly (max temp – min temp)) (BIO2), Isothermality (BIO2/BIO7) (×100) (BIO3), Temperature Annual Range (BIO5-BIO6) (BIO7), Precipitation of Wettest Month (BIO13), Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation) (BIO15) and Precipitation of Warmest Quarter (BIO18) were found to be strong correlates for all four backgrounds. The predicted probabilities from the model containing these seven selected variables, demonstrated higher invasion risk in the central part of India than the model containing all the predictors.Accurate analysis of present distributions and effective predictive modelling of future distributions of invasive alien species is of vital importance for the early detection of the invasion and rapid remedial actions downstream. This study may aid in the adoption of management initiatives like early detection and rapid response. This could result in identifying both new populations and established populations to be prioritized for management.This study assessed the spatial patterns of significant negative trend of forest seasonal greenness over the different forest types of India using 8-day composite MODIS NDVI (500\\xa0m) time series data (2001–2014). It was further analyzed to quantify the negative changes in the core forest areas and to indentify hotspots of it over the large protected forest areas. Significant negative changes in the seasonal greenness were found to be highest over tropical moist deciduous forest (2067.35 thousand ha) followed by tropical dry deciduous (1407.73 thousand ha), tropical wet evergreen (577.43 thousand ha), tropical semi evergreen (442.58 thousand ha), subtropical broad leaved (321.13 thousand ha) and Himalayan moist temperate forest (293.80 thousand ha). Mangroves forest also showed decrease in its greenness over 15.6% of its total area. Interestingly, most of the observed negative changes of high to medium magnitude were found in the core areas of the forest types. Hotspots analysis revealed spatially coherent significant negative changes of seasonal greenness over the large protected areas i.e. Similipal wildlife sanctuary of Odisha, Rajaji national park of Uttarakhand, Achanakmar wildlife sanctuary of Chhattisgarh and Sundarban of West Bengal. The outcomes of the present study would help in the prioritization of the forest types and protected forest areas for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation programmes.accelerating local and global environmental change threatens societal well-being now and in the future in a variety of ways, especially in developing countries. A necessary condition for responding adequately to this environmental crisis is the generation of knowledge that speaks to policy and action, and is holistic, not fragmented along disciplinary lines. The idea of interdisciplinary applied research on the environment has been around since the early 1970s and has taken different institutional forms and labels. In developing countries such as India, the academic community has generally ‘disciplined’ environmental pedagogy into environmental ‘science’ programs, and academic research also continues largely on disciplinary lines. We review the experience of the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bangalore, India, that was set up almost two decades ago as an effort to institutionalize an interdisciplinary and problem-oriented research and teaching paradigm. One key element of this effort has been an explicitly normative but broad set of concerns, including equity and democratic governance as integral aspects of conservation and sustainability. Another has been an emphasis on balancing academic rigor with social relevance, the latter achieved not just by speaking to policy makers, but by building collaborations with local communities and activist groups in a number of field sites. Finally, building an explicitly interdisciplinary PhD programme in spite of significant resource and other constraints has built a common perspective. In our analysis, we highlight factors that influence success, including clarity and a common understanding of the mission, human resources, resolution of perennial tensions between disciplinary and interdisciplinary work, commitment to the program structure, program and institutional leadership, and the framework for rewards and incentives. Availability of resources, political support, and the willingness of the state to accept and recognize the work of non-state actors are other major factors. ATREE\\'s experience offers important insights to the conceptualization and implementation of sustainability studies programs elsewhere.Sacred natural sites are considered an additional pillar for biodiversity conservation, next to the protected areas network. However, sacred landscapes are not primarily conservation areas, but exist for cultural and social reasons. To evaluate their strengths and weaknesses as community-based conservation areas, a thorough understanding of the underlying values, institutional arrangements, and outcomes is required. Here, I use institutional economics for a meta-analysis of publications on sacred natural sites to identify potential conflicts in their maintenance, and to analyze institutional arrangements to solve these conflicts. I show that most sacred natural sites resemble common-pool resources and that many design principles that are linked to common-pool resources are also found in traditional institutions managing sacred places. Design principles are no blue-print solution but they may guide future research to identify locally robust institutional arrangements that are linked to the ecological integrity of sacred natural sites.The success of incorporating natural capital into resource- and land-use decisions hinges on the ability to quantify the ecosystem services, forecast the returns to the investments, convert these values into effective policy and finance mechanisms, and the presence of well-functioning institutions and infrastructure. However, ecosystem production functions i.e., the relationship between regulatory functions of the ecosystem and the economic activity it protects or supports are often poorly understood. Even with respect to Forest Watershed Services – a service that is widely recognized and even institutionalized through market based mechanisms in some parts of the world – the biophysical relationships between forests and services such as stream flow stabilization, water quality and water quantity are undefined, particularly for the tropics. For this reason, this study through time series data and multivariate analysis characterizes the relationships between Forest Cover (all lands with tree cover of a canopy density of 10% and above when projected vertically on the horizontal ground with minimum areal extent of 1\\xa0ha), water quality and cost of water treatment in the Western Ghats of peninsular India. In particular, the recursive relationship between the economic and environmental components is estimated by tracing the effects through the two-stage model. Annual value of impacts (increased ‘treatment cost’, increased ‘water losses due to backwash and desludging’, and changes in ‘water yield’) induced by loss of Forest Cover is estimated as 64.96 Indian rupee/m3 treated water/ha/year ($1.32/m3 treated water/ha/year). At an annual rate of change in the forest cover by −0.0088% (average annual rate of change in the forest cover between the years 1994–2007) the deforestation induced costs translate to 3.73 million Indian rupee/year ($0.075\\xa0million/year) according to the 2010–2011 prices for the Panjrapur treatment plant of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. Thus, if deforestation is avoided the Municipal Corporation can save significant amount towards recurring costs of water treatment and to some extent mitigate the costs for the development of a new source.Exponential growth of population and the resultant rapid rate of urbanization and industrialization in India have significantly transformed its nighttime light environment. The study makes an attempt to analyze the spatio-temporal pattern of light pollution and its causative actors in a fast-developing economy. We utilized nighttime light data from 1993 to 2013 and calibrated through linear regression. Ten patches of major changes from the whole study area were selected to assess the intensity of light pollution at regional scale. Spatial analysis of light pollution in selected patches revealed that New Delhi, Telangana, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh experienced increase in very high light pollution intensity. West Bengal, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu witnessed a remarkable change from low to high light pollution. Urban expansion, industrial development and air pollution are main drivers for increasing light pollution. Strong correlation was found between light pollution and digital numbers (DN) values at regional scale. The maps generated through Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Line Scanner Night Time Light data not only helped in assessing the intensity of light pollution but also identified its causative actors.The results of study can effectively be utilized for setting priorities of environmental protection in different geographical regions at various scales.In an effort to prioritize conservation efforts, scientists have developed the concept of biodiversity hotspots. Since most hotspots occur in countries where poverty is widespread, the success of conservation efforts depends upon the recognition that poverty can be a significant constraint on conservation, and at the same time conservation is an important component to the alleviation of long-term poverty. In this paper we present five key socio-economic poverty indicators (access to water, undernourishment, potential population pressure, number living below poverty line and debt service) and integrate them with an ecologically based hotspots analysis in order to illustrate magnitude of the overlap between biological conservation and poverty. The analysis here suggests that the overlap between severe, multifaceted poverty and key areas of global biodiversity is great and needs to be acknowledged. Understanding the magnitude of overlap and interactions among poverty, conservation and macroeconomic processes is crucial for identifying illusive, yet possible, win–win solutions.embers of the kingdoms Chromista, Fungi s.str. and Protozoa studied by mycologists, have received scant consideration in discussions on biodiversity. The number of known species is about 69 000, but that in the world is conservatively estimated at 1·5 million; six-times higher than hitherto suggested. The new world estimate is primarily based on vascular plant: fungus ratios in different regions. It is considered conservative as: (1) it is based on the lower estimates of world vascular plants; (2) no separate provision is made for the vast numbers of insects now suggested to exist; (3) ratios are based on areas still not fully known mycologically; and (4) no allowance is made for higher ratios in tropical and polar regions. Evidence that numerous new species remain to be found is presented. This realization has major implications for systematic manpower, resources, and classification. Fungi have and continue to play a vital role in the evolution of terrestrial life (especially through mutualisms), ecosystem function and the maintenance of biodiversity, human progress, and the operation of Gaia. Conservation in situ and ex situ are complementary, and the significance of culture collections is stressed. International collaboration is required to develop a world inventory, quantify functional roles, and for effective conservation.Tourism has the potential to advance biodiversity conservation through the creation of societal constituency by providing alternative livelihood to resource-dependent communities. Institutional arrangements play a crucial role in ensuring equitable benefit sharing of tourism gains among different stakeholders. We examined this role of institutional arrangements in four National Parks of the Indian Western Himalaya at varying altitude through multiple case study analysis using qualitative methods. Our results suggest that a three-tier setup involving local communities and civil society organizations, supported by enabling government policies is most efficacious in mainstreaming socio-economic development of local communities and environmental concerns in tourism management framework. Strong local institutions with intrinsic spatial linkage are required to ensure maximum benefits to all sections of society and least monetary leakages. We recommend that in natural landscapes with conflicting interests among stakeholders, a hierarchical three-tier institutional arrangement should be encouraged to achieve the goals of sustainable tourism.The Albany Mobile Belt is dominated by ductile fabrics and regional structures formed during progressive dextral transpression at ∼ 1190 Ma (D1) resulting from NW-SE to NNW-SSE shortening and represents the oblique convergence between the West Australian and East Antarctic shields. Deformation was accompanied by metamorphism up to granulite facies and granitoid intrusion.Neoproterozoic extension and progressive deformation within a sinistral transcurrent to transtensional shear zone in the Leeuwin Complex of the southern Darling Mobile Belt may be contemporaneous with transpressional shearing along the Donnybrook-Nannup Shear Zone on the western Yilgarn Craton margin. During this Neoproterozoic event, E-W Mesoproterozoic trends in the western Albany Mobile Belt have been rotated into a N-S orientation. Ductile reactivation and overprinting of Mesoproterozoic structures is accompanied by retrogression of granulite facies assemblages to amphibolite facies, migmatisation and pegmatite and granitoid intrusion. In demonstrating that the N-S orientation of the western Albany Mobile Belt results from a younger event, a continuation of this mobile belt is expected in northeast India, whilst a continuation of the Darling Mobile Belt may exist in the Mirnyy area of East Antarctica.Folding and the formation of conjugate brittle-ductile shear zones during NE-SW shortening and Early Cambrian conjugate faulting and jointing resulting from ESE-WNW shortening is common to both the western Albany Mobile Belt and Leeuwin Complex.This paper reviews biological and economic issues related to biodiversity, including problems of estimating the number of species globally, rates and causes of extinction, and measures biodiversity. It also argues that, while the value of the earth\\'s ecosystems and natural capital may be large, at the margin, undiscovered pharmaceutical values of biodiversity and existence values are small. The challenge of biodiversity research is to make a stronger case for sacrificing economic development benefits for increased protection of biodiversity.The presence of roads in any landscape is known to negatively influence terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Many tourist destinations and religious enclaves in developing countries are inside protected areas (PA). They are well connected by roads and attract thousands of visitors. The effect of such large human congregations inside PA on biodiversity is not well understood. Here, we address the impacts of increased vehicular traffic due to religious tourism on local fauna inside the Kalakad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in south India. We sampled sections of surfaced roads for mortalities before and during an annual festival across three habitats in 2008 and 2009. Millipedes, anurans, insects and reptiles dominated the mortalities and mammals avoided the roads. A total of 1413 individuals belonging to 56 species were killed on roads. Nocturnal species constituted 50% of these mortalities and 64% of the species composition. There was a 299% increase in road mortalities and 648% increase in nocturnal species mortality during the festival compared to those before the festival. Mean mortalities varied across habitats and were highest in moist deciduous forests. Mortalities were influenced significantly by vehicular traffic rather than rainfall. Indications of a temporary local extinction were evident beyond certain threshold of vehicular movement. The number of vehicles plying on the roads was three times higher than the threshold level as determined in this study. The festival also had a spillover effect by causing increased mortalities on roads not connected to the temple. We discuss several strategies to minimize impacts due to large scale vehicular movement inside protected areas.The present study, first of its kind, has analyzed the land cover and investigated the spatial patterns of deforestation and forest fragmentation in South Asian region since the 1930\\'s. This region comprises of eight countries: India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Maldives. In South Asia, agricultural land is predominant constituting 43% of the total geographical area followed by barren land (19.99%) and forests (14.72%). The long-term change analysis using the classified maps of 1930 and 2014 indicated a loss of 29.62% of the forest cover. Higher annual net deforestation rates were observed in the period from 1930–1975 (0.68%) followed by 1975–1985 (0.23%), 1985–1995 (0.12%), 1995–2005 (0.06%) and 2005–2014 (0.04%) for the region. Forest fragmentation had significant spatio-temporal variation across the South Asian countries. In 1930, 88.91% of the South Asian forest was classified as large core forest, 8.18% as edge forest and 1.18% as perforated forest. The large core forest category has decreased significantly in area over last eight decades. The results of the present study are expected to serve as a reference for the evaluation of globally agreed Aichi biodiversity target 5 for South Asian countries. This study will be a valuable basis for developing management strategies and restoration programs as it tracks the spatial changes in deforestation and forest fragmentation.The article describes the land use system transition dynamics in selected states in India and discusses its underlying biodiversity impacts and economic driving forces. The concept of system transition is described as a continuum between forests and highly intensive agriculture via different grades of intensification where profit differential is identified as the system transition pressure. In order to operationalise the concept, the article develops land use suitability, input use intensity and farming system diversity indices which are calculated for different agricultural cropping systems in the selected states of India. The results show the apparent decline in land use suitability, reduction in farming system diversity, increase of cultivation intensity, reflecting a reduction in planned and associated agro-biodiversity. The results also show increasing transition pressure to shift from low intensive and high diverse systems to high intensive low diverse systems that represent increasing opportunity cost of conservation of the former systems. A set of policy measures to deflate the transition pressure that can at least retain a threshold of traditional high diversity systems are briefly discussed. The study also outlines further research directions.raditional herbal medicine is predominantly practiced by the rural people of India, especially remote areas such as the Uttara Kannada District in Western Ghats of Karnataka. Local traditional healers play an important role in the management of reproductive health problems of the native population due to socio-economical and geographical factors.In the present study, 92 traditional medicine practitioners/healers from various regions of Uttara Kannada district were interviewed to collect information on the use of herbal treatments for a range of female and male reproductive disorders. Information was also collected on the method of preparation, dose and duration along with the botanical names, family and local names of the medicinal plants. The plants were then collected and identified. A total of 18 formulations from 25 plant species belonging to 17 families were identified, which are commonly used to treat 12 different reproductive ailments.This study identifies herbal remedies not previously documented, that are used by indigenous people in the treatment of reproductive disorders. Additionally, the paper highlights the need to retain and explore the rich biodiversity associated with Indian rain forests that may result in the discovery of new medical treatments. Finally, this paper notes the continuing reliance on herbal medicines and healing traditions by local people in remote areas. Understanding and working with local healers and tribes provides a unique opportunity to learn about the use of potentially new herbal and plant medications.ObjectiveTo record the medicinal plants of Uthapuram Village, Madurai district, Tamilnadu, South India for the first time and the usage of these medicinal plants to remediate the diseases among the peoples.MethodsExplorative field trips were made to the village for about twelve months from April 2012 to May 2013 to survey the medicinal plants and collect the information from the villagers.ResultsFrom this study 52 species of valuable medicinal plants belonging to 36 families were recorded and their ethnomedicinal values were collected from the village peoples.ConclusionThis study focuses the importance, utilization and conservation of the medicinal plants among the people.The cultivation of cash crops in the understorey of tropical forests is an ancient practice, but the effects of cultivation on forest ecosystem processes are poorly understood. We assessed the effects of planting the high-value spice crop cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum) on forest structure, tree species composition, and soil properties in the montane forests of the Knuckles Forest Reserve in central Sri Lanka, where cardamom cultivation has been banned since 1985 because of the high conservation value of this site. Vegetation and soil were sampled in forest under-planted with cardamom and adjacent natural forests without planted cardamom. The densities of woody plants (⩾5\\xa0cm\\xa0dbh), saplings (<5\\xa0cm\\xa0dbh and ⩾1.5\\xa0m tall), and seedlings (<1.5\\xa0m tall) were lower in cardamom plantations than natural forests, while stand basal area was marginally higher in cardamom plantations. Canopy openness at 1.3\\xa0m height was higher in the cardamom plantations (mean\\xa0±\\xa0SEM: 35\\xa0±\\xa08%) than in the natural forests (19\\xa0±\\xa03%). Pioneer tree species such as Macaranga sp. increased in abundance in cardamom plantations, and this contributed to the emergence of a difference in species composition between cardamom plantations and adjacent natural forests. Species richness of trees ⩾5\\xa0cm\\xa0dbh per plot was higher in natural forests than cardamom plantations, while species diversity was higher in cardamom plantations. The concentration of total N in top-soil was higher in natural forests, while concentrations of total P and exchangeable K were higher in the cardamom plantations. We conclude that cardamom cultivation results in a net loss of tree stems through weeding and opening of the canopy to promote cardamom production. The higher concentrations of total P and exchangeable K in the soil of cardamom plantations may be associated with the application of fertilizer, while total N concentration may have been higher in the natural forests because residual uncultivated forest occurs at a slightly higher elevation than the majority of cardamom plantations and/or because of elevated denitrification rates in the cardamom plantation. Since cardamom cultivation has affected forest structure and soil properties, management interventions may be required to mitigate these effects in high conservation value forests where cardamom cultivation has been banned.The occurrence and abundance of five species of arboreal mammals in 25 rain forest fragments ranging from <1 ha to 2500 ha in area in the Anamalai Hills in south India, were examined in relation to several habitat and landscape variables. The lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus) was the most affected, being absent from 15 fragments while the Nilgiri langur (Trachypithecus johnii) was absent from six and the Malabar giant squirrel (Ratufa indica) from only three fragments. The densities of the giant squirrel, the large brown flying squirrel (Petaurista petaurista) and the Travancore flying squirrel (Petinomys fuscocapillus) increased with decreasing area and increasing disturbance level. In logistic regression, canopy height and tree density were the best predictors of the occurrence of the lion-tailed macaque and the Nilgiri langur, respectively. Area of the fragment may be an important predictor of occurrence of these species only when the fragments are very small. Once initially present, their continued occurrence is better predicted by habitat variation, consistent with the ecology of the species. It is possible to retain the arboreal mammals in the rain forest fragments through improving habitat quality. The suggested measures include (a) prevention of degradation due to lopping and felling of trees; (b) assisted regeneration in forest fragments; and (c) retention of orchards of jack fruit trees (Artocarpus integrifolia), guava (Psidium guajava), etc., in the labour settlements around the fragments. Land use policies that would prevent conversion of cardamom plantations into tea or coffee plantations are also needed.The resource issues around restoring human dominated landscapes in tropical South Asia are complex and can be divided into topics concerning forest fragmentation and restoration. Issues that focus on effects of forest fragmentation include studies that show declines in forest structure and standing carbon stocks within forest fragments as compared to contiguous forest; changes in bird composition and flock density in relation to land use – especially between forests, the forest buffer zones and agricultural lands (tea, coffee); and the potential origins of many sacred groves as forest fragments and their future roles as cultural, social and ecological centers of reforestation within deforested landscapes. Studies that focus on restoration have demonstrated the benefits of plantations as mechanisms to establish second growth forests and native species plantings for both economic and conservation purposes; the incorporation of indigenous plants that produce non-timber forest products in forest restoration programs; and the control of fire, soil preparation and protection from herbivory as treatments that can facilitate natural forest regeneration in montane grasslands.The geological history of the Indian subcontinent is marked by successive episodes of extensive isolation, which have provided ideal settings for the development of a unique floral and faunal diversity. By molecular phylogenetic analysis of a large set of ranid frog taxa from the Oriental realm, we show that four genera, now restricted to torrential habitats in the Western Ghats of India and the central highlands of Sri Lanka, represent remnants of ancient divergences. None of three other biodiversity hotspots in the Oriental mainland were found to harbour an equivalent level of long-term evolutionary history in this frog group. By unceasingly providing favourable humid conditions, the subcontinent’s southern mountain ranges have served as refugia for old lineages, and hence constitute a unique reservoir of ancient ranid endemism.Monitoring the changes in forest-cover and understanding the dynamics of the forest is becoming increasingly important for the sustainable management of forest ecosystems. This paper uses temporal MODIS Vegetation Continuous Field (MODIS-VCF) to monitor the tree cover change in the Indian region over a period of 6\\xa0years (2000–2005). Pixel-based linear regression model is developed to identify rate of deforestation and fragmentation at landscape level. The regression parameters viz., slope, offset and variance are used to identify threshold between forest and non-forest classes. The classification algorithm resulted into change area, no change area, positive change and negative changes. MODIS-VCF raw product of 2005 was validated using the field data and showed a coefficient of determination (R2\\xa0=\\xa00.85) between percent tree cover and individual plot wise canopy cover information. The results were overlaid with UNEP protected area boundary. On a long-term basis, the forest cover change was monitored using medium spatial resolution (Landsat and IRS) satellite data to identify the rate of deforestation and fragmentation at landscape level. The developed approach is efficient and effective for regional monitoring of forest cover change. It could be automated for regular usage and monitoring.Ethnopharmacological relevanceEnsete superbum (Roxb.) Cheesman. (Family: Musaceae), commonly known as “Wild Banana” is well recorded as popular ethnomedicine for medicinal and nutritional uses by different people and communities native to India, Ethiopia, Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam.Aim of the reviewDespite the wide ethnomedicinal and pharmacological studies on E. superbum, there are no concise elaborated article comprising reviews of published literature. So, herein we designed this review article to discuss the current ethnopharmacology, pharmacognosy, phytochemistry, pharmacology and intellectual property status of E. superbum.Materials and methodsExhaustive literature searches were performed on E. superbum through various scientific and patent search engines such as Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, USPTO, Google patents, and Espacenet, using different keywords for screening of relevant information.ResultsE. superbum was recorded in different regions of the world for ailments such as dog bite, calculi, semen production, abortion, leucorrhoea, stomachache, immune response, pain, diabetes, psychosomatic, contraceptive, umbilical cord care, convulsions, pneumonia, cholera, labor and delivery pain, dehydration, appendicitis, chickenpox, measles, urinary problems, food poisoning, snake bites, diarrhoea, dysentery, jaundice, bone fracture, infections, fever, asthma, hiccups and leucoderma. Major bioactive phytochemicals such as triterpenoid esters, proanthocyanidin, pro-pelargonidin glucosides, pelargonidin, anigorufone, hydroxyanigorufone, β-carboline alkaloids and fractions such as VIDR-2T, VIDR-2GC, VIDR-2GD were reported. Pharmacologically, E. superbum was found to be non-toxic (LD50 =\\u202f3235.9\\u202fmg/kg) and has been reported to possesses antiurolithiatic, antidiabetic, antifertility, anti-estrogenic, antiviral, cardiovascular and anti-inflammatory activities.ConclusionsE. superbum could be an excellent source of safe and effective medicinal and nutritional herbal remedies for human and animal consumption.In this study we attempted to explore patterns of diversity, abundance, climbing and dispersal mode of lianas in relation to disturbance in 40 Indian subtropical dry forests. The sites were selected to represent four disturbance categories: relatively undisturbed, moderately disturbed, much disturbed and heavily disturbed. All lianas ≥1\\xa0cm dbh were counted, which resulted in a total amount of 5689 individuals of lianas, representing 77 species in 62 genera and 32 families. Liana species richness and abundance increased with forest disturbance, but the liana basal area values showed an opposite trend, with high scores in undisturbed sites. Twining was the main climbing mechanism (61.3%) and zoochory (59.6%) was the main dispersal mode in all the four forest categories. Application of Bray–Curtis cluster analysis produced three distinct clusters in which the much disturbed category was more distant from the others. High abundance of large lianas in undisturbed sites and that of the invasive Lantana camara in heavily disturbed site signals the conservation significance of the less disturbed study sites. The predominance of zoochorous dispersal indicates the faunal dependence of lianas, besides of host trees, thus underlining the need for a holistic approach in biodiversity conservation of this and similar tropical forests.This study was undertaken to investigate the use of satellite remote sensing data in forest-type mapping and change detection in a part of the Western Ghats in Karnataka, India. Using Landsat MSS data, it could be possible to map various types of forests viz., evergreen, semi-evergreen, moist deciduous, dry deciduous, degraded and scrub, and to detect changes in their spatial distribution over a period of time. A reduction of 5.66% in total forest area was noted from 1973 to 1985. The decrease was pronounced in the case of semi-evergreen and moist deciduous forests. This study also demonstrated (a) that temporal, low-resolution satellite data could be conveniently used in forest-type mapping and temporal monitoring on an operational level and (b) that such a survey is time- and cost-effective.The tree rhododendrons include the most widely distributed Himalayan Rhododendron species belonging to the subsection Arborea. Distributions of two members of this sub-species were modelled using bioclimatic data for current conditions (1950–2000). A subset of the least correlated bioclimatic variables was used for ecological niche modelling (ENM). We used an ENM ensemble method in the BiodiversityR R-package to map the suitable climatic space for tree rhododendrons based on 217 point location records. Ensemble bioclimatic models for tree rhododendrons had high predictive power with bioclimatic variables, which also separated the climatic spaces for the two species. Tree rhododendrons were found occurring in a wide range of climate and the distributional limits were associated with isothermality, temperature ranges, temperature of the wettest quarter, and precipitation of the warmest quarter of the year. The most suitable climatic space for tree rhododendrons was predicted to be in western Yunnan, China, with suitability declining towards the west and east. Its occurrence in a wide range of climatic settings with highly dissected habitats speaks to the adaptive capacity of the species, which might open up future options for their conservation planning in regions where they are listed as threatened.This study examines the influence of an extra-curricular educational program on children\\'s knowledge and cultural valuation of wild food plants, which are an important component of their diets. This program aims to reinforce children\\'s traditional knowledge and values around biological resources in Wayanad, India\\'s Western Ghats, encouraging tribal and non-tribal children to learn from each other and from their own communities. Results show that the educational program has enhanced children\\'s ability to identify selected wild food plants. Moreover, strong social stigma related to wild food plant gathering also appears to have been effectively countered, and the program seems to have created more self-confidence among the children about (a) the perceptions of others\\' social attitudes towards their gathering practices, and (b) the importance of these plants as part of their diets and cultures.This study estimates the value of forest ecosystem services provided by a protected area in a biodiversity hotspot in India. It also addresses some of the shortcomings identified in existing literature by estimating the value of several intangible benefits, and disservices of forests ignored in most valuation studies, as well as the added value from intact forests as compared to from alternative landscapes. Using primary and secondary data, and economic valuation techniques the study shows that the total net benefits provided by the Nagarhole national park in Karnataka, India are considerable. The added value of benefits from the park is also higher as compared to from alternative landscapes considering just three ecosystem services. If these are factored in decision making it could strengthen the economic case for conserving forests in tropical countries such as India where there is immense pressure to divert forests for meeting development needs.Information is given on the population status, distribution and ecology of the Ganges river dolphin, Platanista gangetica, in the Karnali River, Nepal. Seven animals were counted. Sightings were highly habitat-specific. Six habitats were identified and classified as primary or marginal, according to differences in physical characteristics and sighting frequencies within them (χ2, p < 0·05, d.f. = 5). Mean sighting frequencies were 0·57 and 0·13 sightings/visit for primary and marginal habitats, respectively. Primary habitats were characterized by an eddy counter-current system in the main river flow caused by a fine sand/silt point bar formed from sediment deposits of a convergent stream branch or tributary. Marginal habitats were characterized by a smaller eddy counter-current system caused by an upstream meander. Mean group size was 1·38 animals. Dolphin movements within primary habitats were found to be nonrandom and aggregate for 25 theodolite tracking sessions (χ2, p < 0·05, d.f. = 1–7), concentrated in locations of high prey availability and reduced flow. Human disturbance effects are summarized. Recommendations are given for preservation.A seamless vegetation type map of India (scale 1: 50,000) prepared using medium-resolution IRS LISS-III images is presented. The map was created using an on-screen visual interpretation technique and has an accuracy of 90%, as assessed using 15,565 ground control points. India has hitherto been using potential vegetation/forest type map prepared by Champion and Seth in 1968. We characterized and mapped further the vegetation type distribution in the country in terms of occurrence and distribution, area occupancy, percentage of protected area (PA) covered by each vegetation type, range of elevation, mean annual temperature and precipitation over the past 100 years. A remote sensing-amenable hierarchical classification scheme that accommodates natural and semi-natural systems was conceptualized, and the natural vegetation was classified into forests, scrub/shrub lands and grasslands on the basis of extent of vegetation cover. We discuss the distribution and potential utility of the vegetation type map in a broad range of ecological, climatic and conservation applications from global, national and local perspectives. We used 15,565 ground control points to assess the accuracy of products available globally (i.e., GlobCover, Holdridge’s life zone map and potential natural vegetation (PNV) maps). Hence we recommend that the map prepared herein be used widely. This vegetation type map is the most comprehensive one developed for India so far. It was prepared using 23.5\\xa0m seasonal satellite remote sensing data, field samples and information relating to the biogeography, climate and soil. The digital map is now available through a web portal (http://bis.iirs.gov.in).Hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha) or river shad is an anadromous fish species widely distributed in the North Indian Ocean, mainly in the Bay of Bengal (BoB). Hilsa is the national fish of Bangladesh and it contributes 10% of the total fish production of the country, with a market value of $1.74 billion. Hilsa also holds a very important place in the economics of West Bengal of India with 12.5% of the catch and also tops the marine capture in Myanmar. During the last two decades Hilsa production from inland waters has been stable, whereas marine yields in the BoB increased substantially. In order to sustainably manage the trans-boundary stock of Hilsa, the taxonomy, distribution, habitat, migration patterns, population dynamics, fisheries and socio-economics aspects of the fishery have been reviewed here. To achieve a successful trans-boundary management for the Hilsa stock, complete ban on undersize fishing, well-targeted temporal and spatial bans, creation of protected areas in strategic points, incentive for Hilsa fishers and ecological restoration of Hilsa habitats and more work on technological development of Hilsa aquaculture are recommended.Millions of people are dependent on tropical forests for livelihood. However, their dependence on meagre incomes from nontimber forest products (NTFPs) and payment for ecosystem services (PES) are leading to continuing poverty. It is doubtful if the program, Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has yet achieved much in its primary goal of forest conservation, and the chance of it helping to alleviate rural poverty is slim. Forest conservation per se hardly creates economic opportunities, beyond survival, for rural people. Our efforts for conserving forests and their biodiversity will remain less effective as long as there are so many enclaves of trenchant poverty within and around them in the landscapes and we continue to by-pass practical routes to poverty alleviation. Poverty can be alleviated only if local actions spur economic development in which local communities have a rightful and fair share and can earn rewards for their entrepreneurships.Wood is a renewable, recyclable, versatile and sustainable natural resource. The demands for wood products are rising in developing countries, as their economies grow. They also face endemic wood deficits. This provides opportunities to pro-actively develop commercial forestry as a path to rural development and poverty alleviation. That would also assist national climate change mitigation measures, because forests sequester carbon, wood products are largely carbon positive and timber- based options are on hand to substitute for high emission materials such as concrete, steel and aluminium used to build our living environments.To move along this path, the businesses of tree growing by small-growers and local value adding should be strengthened, catalysing the entrepreneurial spirits of local people. Central to this is the need to put in place strategies to improve the productivity of and value from small scale enterprises; yet there is a serious lack of research and application to serve this key need. Among other constraints faced by small-growers include, lack of transparent and legal rights to land ownership in several countries, layers of bureaucratic regulations and the current international forest certification systems which are cumbersome and unaffordable for small-growers. Actions are possible and needed for simplifying or removing road blocks on all these fronts, along with, importantly, the development of markets for diverse products. Growth of the forestry sector as an engine for rural development warrants far greater recognition and investment than has been the case so far. We need to re-imagine and strengthen the role of forestry including commercial wood business - green growth - as an effective path to rural development and poverty alleviation.Swertia chirata (Family: Gentianaceae) is a potent and valuable medicinal herb used in various herbal formulations in Indian system of medicine. Different species of Swertia are being used as constituents in various herbal formulations. Present study was undertaken for the screening of an efficient extraction technique and for the development of a rapid and simultaneous quantification of four pentacyclic triterpenoids in different populations of Swertia species by a high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC)-densitometric method. This method involved the separation of four triterpenoids with a single mobile phase composition consisting of n-hexane, ethyl acetate, toluene (14.2, 4, 1.8 v/v). The retention factor (Rf) values for oleanolic acid (OA), ursolic acid (UA), betulinic acid (BA), and lupeol (Lup) were 0.25, 0.50, 0.58 and 0.74 respectively. In this study, microwave assisted extraction (MAE) using aqueous ethanol proved to be the most efficient method for extraction for all the studied triterpenoids when compared with the other conventional methods. The present HPTLC method was found to be precise, fast, and cost effective and can be used for the quality control of any Swertia samples with regards to its pentacyclic triterpenoids content. Since, S. chirata is a critically endangered species, the present study depicts the utility of other species of Swertia viz. S. paniculata and S. angustifolia as promising substitutes for S. chirata in herbal preparations.In vitro multiple shoot production was achieved in Ceropegia bulbosa var. bulbosa. Nodal segments obtained from mature plant were used as an explant and their morphogenetic potential was tested on, Murashige and Skoog\\'s medium containing cytokinins alone or in combination with auxins. Application of 8.88\\xa0μM, 6-benzyladenine was most effective for shoot regeneration and resulted in an average of 9.7 shoots/explant. Nodal segments obtained from in vitro proliferated shoots of C. bulbosa, were encapsulated in calcium alginate beads for large-scale clonal propagation, short-term conservation, germplasm exchange and distribution. Maximum percent response for conversion of encapsulated nodal segments into plantlets was 100%. Encapsulated nodal segments could be stored at low temperature (4\\xa0°C) up to 60 days with a survival frequency of 50.7%. Morphologically identical plants generated in vitro were genetically identical when analyzed using random decamer primers (RAPD).Land use and hydrology are interdependent, so that land use modeling could benefit from hydrologic modeling. This study aims to integrate spatial predictions of hydrologic variables as provided by a hydrologic model into a land use model for a rapidly urbanizing catchment in India. The benefits of this integration are quantified by comparing predictions of a land use model that uses a basic set of explanatory variables to a land use model that additionally uses the modeled hydrologic variables. Our results indicate that the integration of the hydrologic variables improved the model accuracy indicated by overall accuracy (+3 and\\xa0+\\xa04 percentage points (pp)), class specific user and producer accuracies (up to +8 pp) and figure of merit (+4 and\\xa0+\\xa05.3 pp) when compared with land use classifications at two points in time. Moreover, the land use patterns show that the integration of the hydrologic variables helped to avoid allocation errors.Community forests/rangelands, called Orans and Gauchars in the western arid part of India, constitute a significant proportion of the total geographical area of the region. Given the economic importance of these areas from time immemorial, the local people took special care to protect and sustainably utilize these common property resources. However, these forests and rangelands have suffered severe degradation in the recent past. Rehabilitation of Orans and Gauchars needs proper planning and execution of a technically feasible package, tailored to suit their unique edaphic, climatic, vegetation, social and legal status. Keeping in view the vast potential of these areas to sustain large scale livestock farming for overall economic upliftment of the local population, there is an urgent need to rehabilitate these degraded areas in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Salient problems faced by these natural assets of western Rajasthan and strategies for their rehabilitation have been discussed in the paper.Sapindus emarginatus is an economically important tropical tree species sparsely distributed in different geographical provinces like Gangetic Plains, Western Ghats, and Deccan Plateau in India. In the present paper estimation of genetic variability within and among 41 accessions representing five populations was carried out using 3 single primer amplification reaction (SPAR) methods viz. RAPD, DAMD and ISSR. The cumulative data analysis was carried out for all three SPAR methods, and showed 82.32% polymorphism across all the accessions of S. emarginatus. Jaccard\\'s similarity values among 41 accessions ranged from 0.15 to 0.49 with an average value of 0.37. The intra-population genetic diversity revealed highest values of Nei\\'s genetic diversity (0.19,) Shannon information index (0.29) and polymorphic loci (55.18%), among the accessions of Gujarat (GJ) population, while the corresponding lowest values were (0.10), (0.15) and (26.40%) respectively among the accessions of Rajasthan (RJ) population. The maximum inter-population average genetic distance (0.20) was between Karnataka (KA) and RJ, while the corresponding least genetic distance (0.06) was between Allahabad (AL) and Varanasi (VS) populations. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed maximum percentage of variation among individuals of populations (72%) followed by 16% among regions and 12% among populations. Principal coordinate analysis (PCA) of cumulative data also supported the clustering pattern in the UPGMA dendrogram. These results suggest that genetic diversity is corroborating with the geographical diversity. Mantel\\'s test was performed which revealed a highly significant correlation between cumulative vs RAPD, and showed the maximum (0.93) correlation coefficient, followed by cumulative vs ISSR (0.78) and cumulative vs DAMD (0.91) respectively, and this clearly indicates that the SPAR methods (RAPD, DAMD and ISSR) are sufficiently informative and are suitable to analyze the genetic variability within and among the populations of S. emarginatus.Under a centralized forest management system dating back to the start of the British colonial regime, forest-dwelling communities across India were denied formal rights to access forest resources, while large tracts of forest land were degraded or deforested. Enacted in 2006, The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, better known as the Forest Rights Act, was a landmark piece of legislation in India. Its attempt at righting a “historic injustice” and “strengthening the conservation regime” through recognition of forest dwellers’ right to sustainably use and manage forests is significant for socioeconomic, political and ecological reasons. Beyond implications for people and forests of India, the Forest Rights Act represents an important case study that informs analysis of a global trend toward decentralization of governance of forests as well as rights-based approaches to development. This study analyses implementation of the Forest Rights Act across India for the period 2008-2017. We examine rates of formal distribution of rights claims at the level of individual states, and we try to explain variance across states through reliance on political, economic and ecological considerations. In trying to make sense of the large variation in the outcomes of claims made under the Forest Rights Act across states, we find that extent of forest cover is positively associated with rate of distribution of claims, and presence of left-wing extremism is positively associated with claim rejection rates. These findings indicate constraints to wider and more even formal implementation of this legal foundation for development, and they highlight important governance tensions underlying prospects for environmental conservation through decentralization of forest management authority.The aim of the present study was to screen cardioactive herbs from Western Ghats of India. The heart beat rate (HBR) and blood flow during systole and diastole were tested in zebrafish embryos. We found that Cynodon dactylon (C. dactylon) induced increases in the HBR in zebrafish embryos with a HBR of (3.968±0.344) beats/s, which was significantly higher than that caused by betamethosone [(3.770±0.344) beats/s]. The EC50 value of C. dactylon was 3.738 μg/mL. The methanolic extract of Sida acuta (S. acuta) led to decreases in the HBR in zebrafish embryos [(1.877±0.079) beats/s], which was greater than that caused by nebivolol (positive control). The EC50 value of Sida acuta was 1.195 μg/mL. The untreated embryos had a HBR of (2.685±0.160) beats/s at 3 d post fertilization (dpf). The velocities of blood flow during the cardiac cycle were (2,291.667±72.169) μm/s for the control, (4,250±125.000) μm/s for C. dactylon and (1,083.333±72.169) μm/s for S. acuta. The LC50 values were 32.6 μg/mL for C. dactylon and 20.9 μg/mL for S. acuta. In addition, the extracts exhibited no chemical genetic effects in the drug dosage range tested. In conclusion, we developed an assay that can measure changes in cardiac function in response to herbal small molecules and determine the cardiogenic effects by microvideography.In Kerala, based on management systems, sacred groves can be categorised into three groups namely those managed by individual families, by groups of families and by the statutory agencies for temple management (Devaswom Board). Ollur Kavu, S.N. Puram Kavu and Iringole Kavu which represent above mentioned management systems, respectively, were studied for their tree species composition and vegetation structure. The study was also designed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of present management systems and role of different stakeholder groups in conserving the sacred groves. Of the three sacred groves, the one managed by individual family (Ollur Kavu) is highly disturbed as indicated by low stem density of mature trees (367\\xa0ha−1) and poor regeneration potential with the ratio between mature trees and saplings is 1:0.4. In order to quantify the level of disturbance in these sacred groves, Ramakrishnan index of stand quality (RISQ) was calculated. The values obtained for all the three tree layers (i.e., mature trees, saplings and seedlings) in single family managed sacred grove (Ollur Kavu) was between 2.265 and 2.731, an indicator of the dominance of light demanding species in the population, suggested that the grove is highly disturbed one. Whereas, other two sacred groves are less disturbed as indicated by lower `RISQ\\' values (between 1.319 and 1.648). Iringole Kavu and S.N. Puram Kavu were compared with some other evergreen forests of the Western Ghats of India for the parameters like stem density, basal area and species diversity of trees (gbh≥10.1\\xa0cm). Values obtained for these parameters in the two sacred groves are within the range obtained for other forests. Stakeholder importance value index (SIVI) was calculated based on the attributes like the proximity of the stakeholder to the sacred grove, contribution of stakeholders in managing the sacred grove, benefits being enjoyed by the stakeholder due to involvement with sacred grove and attitude of the stakeholder group towards the conservation and management of sacred grove. This indicated that local people, temple trust and/ or sacred grove owners are the major stakeholders, while in general some other stakeholder groups such as youth clubs, schools, forest department, municipality and local Panchayat with lower SIVI are comparatively neutral in conserving and managing the groves. Some of the major strategies to be adopted are self-imposed complete ban on the removal of biomass for the revitalisation of ecosystem, creation of awareness among local people and all stakeholder groups, identification of the type of contribution a stakeholder group can offer in managing the sacred grove and encouragement of all stakeholders to participate without either directly or indirectly adversely affecting the ecosystem as well as the wisdom and interest of the major stakeholder groups.While there is no substitute for undisturbed forest, secondary forests and agroforests are increasingly common in tropical areas and may be critical to conservation plans. We compared the diversity and abundance of birds and the characteristics of mixed-species bird flocks in forests inside protected reserves to “buffer” areas, consisting of degraded forests and non-native timber plantations at reserve boundaries, and to agricultural areas. We monitored a network of 57 transects placed over an altitudinal gradient (90–2180\\xa0masl) in Sri Lanka and southern India, collecting 398 complete flock observations and 35,686 observations of birds inside and outside of flocks over two\\xa0years. Flocks were rarely found in agricultural areas. However, the density of flocks in buffer areas was similar to that in forests, although buffer flocks were smaller in average flock size and differed significantly in composition, as measured by the proportion of species that were classified, from the literature, as forest interior or open-landscape species. While flock composition was distinct between agricultural, buffer and forest areas, the differences in the composition of flocks was not as great as the differences between the overall communities in these different habitats. Considering buffer transects alone, pine plantations retained fewer forest interior species in flocks than did forests, and small areas of agriculture and abandoned agriculture attracted open-landscape species. Though clearly not equivalent to protected forests, degraded forests and agroforests in buffer areas still hold some conservation value, with forest species found particularly in mixed-species flocks in these human-modified habitats.Genus Nemacheilus, Nemachilichthys and Schistura belong to the family Nemacheilidae of the order Cypriniformes. The present investigation was undertaken to observe genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationship and to develop a molecular-based tool for taxonomic identification. For this purpose, four different types of molecular markers were utilized in which 29 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), 25 inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers, and 10 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker sets were screened and mitochondrial COI gene was sequenced. This study added COI barcodes for the identification of Nemacheilus anguilla, Nemachilichthys rueppelli and Schistura denisoni. RAPD showed higher polymorphism (100%) than the ISSR (93.75–100%) and AFLP (93.86–98.96%). The polymorphic information content (PIC), heterozygosity, multiplex ratio, and gene diversity was observed highest for AFLP primers, whereas the major allele frequency was observed higher for RAPD (0.5556) and lowest for AFLP (0.1667). The COI region of all individuals was successfully amplified and sequenced, which gave a 100% species resolution.Andrographis paniculata is a medicinal herb also known as ‘King of Bitter’. This herb was studied using arbitrary amplified (RAPD and ISSR) and gene targeted (SCoT and CBDP) molecular markers. Thirty-nine accessions were collected from five agro-ecological regions of India. Eighteen RAPD and five ISSR primers generated a total of 124 and 32 amplicons with an average of 6.89 and 6.4 amplicons per primer respectively. Similarly, 22 SCoT and 19CBDP primers were used to characterize A. paniculata accessions. A total of 132 and 97 amplicons were generated, with an average of 6.0 and 5.11 amplicons per primer, respectively. Polymorphic information content (PIC) for RAPD and ISSR primers ranged from 0.32 to 0.45 and 0.25–0.42, with resolving power (Rp) ranging from 2.13 to 10.03 and 2.46–3.96, respectively. PIC values ranged from 0.09 to 0.48 and 0.30–0.46, with an average value of 0.34 and 0.41 per primer for SCoT and CBDP markers, respectively. The resolving power for SCoT and CBDP primers ranged from 2.36 to 10.54 and 1.39–13.15 per primer, respectively. Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) based clustering grouped 39 accessions into three broad clusters based on all four marker systems studied, did not correlate with their agro-ecological regions. Population structure based analysis divided 39 accessions into seven populations, six populations and four populations using RAPD, ISSR and SCoT markers respectively. Whereas only three populations were observed using CBDP primers which corresponded to the grouping observed with the UPGMA. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) based analysis showed that the maximum variation (10%) among agro-ecological regions was observed using CBDP primers; whereas, minimum variation (2%) was observed using SCoT markers. Taken together, our data suggest CBDP markers are better markers for genetic diversity study in A. paniculata.Changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services in terrestrial systems are being driven by the synergistic interactions between the loss of native vegetation and land-use intensification. Disentangling the influence of these two processes on species persistence is an important step towards reconciling conservation and agriculture production. We investigated how forest cover and management intensification affect the conservation value of cacao agroforests for mammals in an Atlantic forest landscape in southern Bahia, the most extensive area of diverse shaded cacao plantations in Brazil. Although both factors affected the distribution of mammal species, management intensification had a stronger effect, negatively affecting a larger number of species. Frequency of domestic dogs, an indirect aspect of management intensification, negatively affected four species and lower connectivity of shading trees decreased the use of cacao agroforests by three species of conservation concern. In comparison, the reduced forest cover negatively affected two species of conservation concern. Our results suggest that controlling domestic dog populations is particularly valuable for large mammal conservation in agroforestry mosaics, since it does not affect crop productivity. Improving shade cover within agroforests, on the other hand, should be implemented carefully, maintaining acceptable yield while promoting canopy connectivity and the recruitment of tree species used by forest dependent mammals. However, the importance of both local management intensification and local forest cover are likely to be context dependent, and changes in their relative importance are likely to occur with different levels of deforestation at the landscape scale.Among the most popular of metrics used to quantify landscape composition are Shannon’s index, believed to emphasize the richness component of diversity, and Simpson’s index, emphasizing the evenness component. These indices can show considerable variation in response to changes in landscape richness and evenness. However, the possibility of encountering opposite trends in the responses of these indices to assemblages that differ in only a single component of diversity has not been sufficiently acknowledged. An opposite response of these indices was observed for two Indian landscapes with the same richness, differing only in evenness. Using a numerical simulation, the likelihood of encountering landscapes with an opposite response was demonstrated to increase with increasing richness, from about 4% for landscapes consisting of three cover types, to about 6% for ten types. This emphasizes the need for caution when choosing an index of landscape diversity. Rare cover types provide habitats for sensitive species and facilitate critical ecological processes. The Shannon index, sensitive to their presence, is therefore recommended for landscape management within an ecological framework. Simpson’s index, more responsive to the dominant cover type, can be used for specific situations where the dominant cover type is of interest, such as single-species reserve design.Watershed management is the process of formulating and carrying out a course of action involving manipulation of natural system of a watershed to achieve specified objectives. This implies the proper use of land and water resources of watershed for optimum production with minimum hazard to natural resources. Remote sensing and GIS techniques have emerged as powerful tools for watershed management programmes. The study area, Harangi Catchment geographically lies between 750 38’ E and 750 55’ E longitude and 120 24’ N and 120 40’ N latitude with an area of 417.54 sq km. In the present study an attempt was made to understand the hydrological processes of the catchment at watershed level by deriving the watershed parameters through Remote Sensing, GIS and other data. Based on the drainage pattern and topography, thirteen watersheds were delineated to understand the hydrological process of the catchment at the watershed level. The drainage density of the watersheds varies from 1.36 to 3.42\\xa0km/km2 which indicate that the area is coarse texture. Runoff was estimated using USDA Soil Conservation Services (SCS) Curve Number model. The information such as land use/ land cover and hydrological soil group map derived from remotely sensed data were overlayed through ArcGIS software to assign the curve number on polygon wise. Soil erosion was estimated by using Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). The weighted soil erosion estimated for the catchment was 19 t/ha/year, which is a moderate soil loss and needs conservation measures.IntroductionEnsete superbum (Roxb.) Cheesman, a wild banana species endemic to the Western Ghats, northeastern hills of India and northern Thailand. The seeds are known for their medicinal value and are widely used by indigenous healers as remedy for human disorders.MethodsSystematic pharmacognostical evaluation of seeds of the plant has been carried out with focus on physicochemical and phytochemical characterization.ResultsMacroscopical and microscopical features of the seed have been documented. Preliminary phytochemical investigations indicated presence of steroid, terpenoids, alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins and sugars. HPTLC fingerprint profile was developed for identification of active compounds.DiscussionE.\\xa0superbum is an under-exploited medicinal plant of immense utility. The seeds are utilized by indigenous communities to cure various human ailment without adverse or side effects The present study has unveiled standardization of macroscopic and microscopic characterizations of the seed coat, embryo and perisperm powder. Seeds of E.\\xa0superbum comprises of hard seed coat, perisperm, endosperm, embryo and chalazal disk. The seed coat consists of exotesta and Mesotesta made from sclerenchyma cells. The silica layer present in seed coat increases the strength and hardness of testa.Determination of physico-chemical parameters for endosperm and testa of seeds are subjected as per standard methods. HPTLC fingerprint profile has also been recorded for identification of the E.\\xa0superbum extract. Phytochemical entities such as steroid, terpenoids, alkaloids, flavanoids, tannins and sugar were detected by colour tests. The standard tests conducted in the present investigation are important and useful in determining authenticity and purity of crude seed powder drug of E.\\xa0superbum.ConclusionThese parameters can be utilized for quick identification of the drug and are useful in establishing the identity of this medicinal material as whole or even in the form of powder.Knowledge of biodiversity is woefully inadequate. Only a fraction of the planet\\'s species has been described by science (the “Linnean shortfall”). Even for described species, scientists often have only fragmentary information about their distributions (the “Wallacean” shortfall). These shortfalls in biodiversity knowledge place serious limitations on the ability to conserve biodiversity in the face of the ongoing extinction crisis. Here, I test the hypothesis that data deficiency may be used to guide surveys and inventories to regions that would increase the probability of discovering new species. I compiled global distribution maps for all Data Deficient amphibian species (species described up to 2004) and constructed a Data Deficiency (DD) surface (the DD surface was based on distribution information obtained from the IUCN Red List). Then, I compared the type-locality sites of new amphibian species descriptions (species described between 2005 and 2009) with the DD surface in order to check if new species discoveries were significantly more abundant within the DD surface or not. Even though the amphibian DD species surface covers only 8% of Earth\\'s land area, 79% of the amphibian species discovered between 2005 and 2009 were within the DD surface. The results suggest that directing surveys towards areas of known data deficiency will likely result in the discovery of species new to science, helping to address the Linnean shortfall. Incorporating DD information from the IUCN Red List may provide an efficient methodology for strategically targeting surveys and inventories, maximizing the chances of obtaining high conservation benefits from them, and helping minimize the costs associated with such endeavours. of deforestation continue to rise in many parts of the tropics, the international conservation community is faced with the challenge of finding approaches which can reduce deforestation and provide rural livelihoods in addition to conserving biodiversity. Much of modern-day conservation is motivated by a desire to conserve ‘pristine nature’ in protected areas, while there is growing recognition of the long-term human involvement in forest dynamics and of the importance of conservation outside protected areas. Agroforestry – intentional management of shade trees with agricultural crops – has the potential for providing habitats outside formally protected land, connecting nature reserves and alleviating resource-use pressure on conservation areas. Here we examine the role of agroforestry systems in maintaining species diversity and conclude that these systems can play an important role in biodiversity conservation in human-dominated landscapes.The impact of biotic pressures on the habitat and population of the endangered grizzled giant squirrel Ratufa macroura dandolena was quantified from December 1987 to January 1989 during a three-year study in Alagarkoil Valley (15 km2) in the Srivilliputtur Grizzled Giant Squirrel Wildlife Sanctuary in south India. This valley has about 40% of the total population of c. 300 of this subspecies in south India. A total of 40,079 people visited the 11 km2 study area during the study period. This included pilgrims (57%), wood cutters (40%) and collectors of minor forest produce such as Combretum ovalifolium climbers and Tamarindus indica fruits.The squirrel population did not show a decline during annual counts over three years but these disturbances resulted in loss of cover, food trees and nesting sites. Conservation measures are needed to safeguard this population and its habitat by the creation of a 40 km2 Alagarkoil Valley National Park and planting of desired species to promote canopy continuity and availability of food plants, nesting sites and cover.Sweet flag (Acorus calamus L.), is a critically endangered species of mountainous regions of India. In order to evaluate and preserve the endangered medicinally important plant Sweet flag. We investigated the variation by collecting the whole plant from different geographical regions. Genetic variability among 20 accessions of this species was assessed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) (25 primers) and inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers (17 primers).The results showed 33.7% of bands formed by RAPD markers and 63.7% for ISSR were polymorphic. The Shannon’s indices (I) and Nei’s genetic diversity (h) among all the accessions were estimated for RAPD and ISSR respectively at 0.58 (SD\\xa0=\\xa00.07), 0.57 (SD\\xa0=\\xa00.13) and 0.40 (SD\\xa0=\\xa00.06), 0.33 (SD\\xa0=\\xa00.11) respectively. The similarity coefficient ranged from 0.72 to 0.94. The results revealed that genetic variation is much low among accessions. Since genetic variation within collected accessions is homogenous, the pattern of low genetic diversity within the accessions specifies that they are monoclonal. Therefore, we proposed that studies of intraspecific variation could be utilized in the development of conservation strategies, by identifying appropriate units of A. calamus for conservation.Commonly proposed definitions of the \"anthropocene\" suggest that significant human alteration of the Earth system is connected to fossil fuel consumption coinciding with the Industrial Revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries, or global change resulting from the \"Great Acceleration\" following the Second World War. Although evidence for earlier, anthropogenically-driven environmental changes are acknowledged, they are seen as qualitatively different. This perspective is also prevalent in conservation and ecological discussions of human impacts on tropical forests. A growing body of archaeological and historical evidence demonstrates, however, that humans influenced physical, chemical, and biological systems through large regions of tropical forest starting as early as 45,000 years ago. This evidence challenges the idea, prevalent in global scenarios of anthropogenic land cover change, that human influence on tropical forests was limited until the colonial or industrial era. This paper reviews the role of tropical forests in the Earth system and, through a synthesis of archaeological data, critiques the prevailing view of anthropogenic influence on tropical forests in the pre-industrial world. We suggest that any definition of the anthropocene should account for the long history of human modifications to tropical forests. Archaeological and palaeoenvironmental research in these ecosystems is also critical to the broader debates in the social and natural sciences around the onset and utility of the anthropocene concept, and the potential for long-term, sustainable occupation of tropical forest environments.Coffee-farming units of India, with their strong orientation to export markets, have in the WTO era, displayed a high propensity for compliance with trade-facilitating environmental norms arising from sanitary and phytosanitary measures. But thee farming units seek to recoup incremental costs arising from compliance with these norms through unsustainable exploitation of their biodiversity wealth. Based on this unique case of conflict between WTO-related environmental standards and biodiversity concerns, the paper advocates integration of national and global environmental concerns with trade-related environmental regulations in the larger interests of sustainable agriculture in developing countries.Orchids (Orchidaceae) are one of the most diverse plant groups on the planet with over 25,000 species. For over a century, scientists and horticulturalists have been fascinated by their complex floral morphology, pollinator specificity and multiple ethnobotanical uses, including as food, flavourings, medicines, ornaments, and perfumes. These important traits have stimulated world-wide collection of orchid species, often for the commercial production of hybrids and leading to frequent overexploitation. Increasing human activities and global environmental changes are also accelerating the threat of orchid extinction in their natural habitats. In order to improve gene conservation strategies for these unique species, innovative developments of cryopreservation methodologies are urgently needed based on an appreciation of low temperature (cryo) stress tolerance, the stimulation of recovery growth of plant tissues in vitro and on the ‘omics’ characterization of the targeted cell system (biotechnology). The successful development and application of such cryobiotechnology now extends to nearly 100 species and commercial hybrids of orchids, underpinning future breeding and species conservation programmes. In this contribution, we provide an overview of the progress in cryobanking of a range of orchid tissues, including seeds, pollen, protocorms, protocorm-like bodies, apices excised from in vitro plants, cell suspensions, rhizomes and orchid fungal symbionts. We also highlight future research needs.Seed dispersal is a key process in plant communities and frugivory is very important in vertebrate communities. This paper updates a review of frugivory and seed dispersal by vertebrates in the Oriental Region (tropical and subtropical Asia) published in 1998. The major conclusions remain the same. Small fruits are consumed by a wide range of potential seed dispersal agents, including species that thrive in small forest fragments and degraded landscapes. Larger and larger-seeded fruits are consumed by progressively fewer dispersers, and the largest depend on a few species of mammals and birds which are highly vulnerable to hunting, fragmentation, and habitat loss. Controlling hunting in both forest areas and the agricultural matrix must be a top priority for conservation. A lot more natural history information has been added to the literature since 1998. This reinforces previous evidence for the importance of hornbills, bulbuls, elephants, gibbons, civets, and fruit bats in seed dispersal, and suggests that the roles of green pigeons, macaques, rodents, bears, and deer were previously underestimated. The taxa for which additional natural history observations would be most valuable include fish, pheasants, pigeons, babblers, rodents, and even-toed ungulates. For other animal taxa, future frugivory and seed dispersal studies need to focus more on the fitness consequences for both the plants and the animals.Protected areas are experiencing increased levels of human pressure. To enable appropriate conservation action, it is critical to map and monitor changes in the type and extent of land cover/use and habitat classes, which can be related to human pressures over time. Satellite Earth observation (EO) data and techniques offer the opportunity to detect such changes. Yet association with field information and expert interpretation by ecologists is required to interpret, qualify and link these changes to human pressure. There is thus an urgent need to harmonize the technical background of experts in the field of EO data analysis with the terminology of ecologists, protected area management authorities and policy makers in order to provide meaningful, context-specific value-added EO products. This paper builds on the DPSIR framework, providing a terminology to relate the concepts of state, pressures, and drivers with the application of EO analysis. The type of pressure can be inferred through the detection of changes in state (i.e. changes in land cover and/or habitat type and/or condition). Four broad categories of changes in state are identified, i.e. land cover/habitat conversion, land cover/habitat modification, habitat fragmentation and changes in landscape connectivity, and changes in plant community structure. These categories of change in state can be mapped through EO analyses, with the goal of using expert judgement to relate changes in state to causal direct anthropogenic pressures. Drawing on expert knowledge, a set of protected areas located in diverse socio-ecological contexts and subject to a variety of pressures are analysed to (a) link the four categories of changes in state of land cover/habitats to the drivers (anthropogenic pressure), as relevant to specific target land cover and habitat classes; (b) identify (for pressure mapping) the most appropriate spatial and temporal EO data sources as well as interpretations from ecologists and field data useful in connection with EO data analysis. We provide detailed examples for two protected areas, demonstrating the use of EO data for detection of land cover/habitat change, coupled with expert interpretation to relate such change to specific anthropogenic pressures. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations and feasibility of using EO data and techniques to identify anthropogenic pressures, suggesting additional research efforts required in this direction.To examine management options for biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, eight research regions were classified into social-ecological domains, using a dataset of indicators of livelihood resources, i.e., capital assets. Potential interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture were then compared among landscapes and domains. The approach combined literature review with expert judgment by researchers working in each landscape. Each landscape was described for land use, rural livelihoods and attitudes of social actors toward biodiversity and intensification of agriculture. Principal components analysis of 40 indicators of natural, human, social, financial and physical capital for the eight landscapes showed a loss of biodiversity associated with high-input agricultural intensification. High levels of natural capital (e.g. indicators of wildland biodiversity conservation and agrobiodiversity for human needs) were positively associated with indicators of human capital, including knowledge of the flora and fauna and knowledge sharing among farmers. Three social-ecological domains were identified across the eight landscapes (Tropical Agriculture-Forest Matrix, Tropical Degrading Agroecosystem, and Temperate High-Input Commodity Agriculture) using hierarchical clustering of the indicator values. Each domain shared a set of interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture and ecological intensification that could also increase food security in the impoverished landscapes. Implementation of interventions differed greatly among the landscapes, e.g. financial capital for new farming practices in the Intensive Agriculture domain vs. developing market value chains in the other domains. This exploratory study suggests that indicators of knowledge systems should receive greater emphasis in the monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and that inventories of assets at the landscape level can inform adaptive management of agrobiodiversity-based interventions.Urban planning is a tool, which enables in managing changes within a spatial approach. It helps in conducting planning activities where the economic, environmental, and social goals are taken care of holistically. Planning process involves studying past trends, learning from past and present, and then preparing a proposal for future. This process mostly assesses the trend of growth and plans for development. A trend follows change in a defined rate. An indefinite or unexpected change spoils the planning process, by breaking the trend of growth. City is known for its resources, geography, population, social-culture structure, economy etc. Whenever there is an unexpected change in any of these parameters, the city undergoes remarkable changes. Disaster also brings hasty changes in all these, which is indeed a challenge to urban planning and design. The fast modernization and adoption of western culture leads to significant changes in socio-cultural and economic spheres. City also changes, when rapid movement of people and resources occur. Tourism industry in this decade brought many changes is Indian cities. It diversifies social and cultural identity of the city and generates tremendous opportunity for economic development. Therefore cities having tourism potential are facing urban planning problems. Exploring these issues and reasons behind it will be helpful to minimize its impact. Tourism cities have tremendous potential of research in this direction. The need of the decade for urban planners and designers is to be prepared for the changes in a tourist city.The status and trends of global biodiversity are often measured with a bias towards datasets limited to terrestrial vertebrates. The first global assessment of an insect order (Odonata) provides new context to the ongoing discussion of current biodiversity loss. A randomly selected sample of 1500 (26.4%) of the 5680 described dragonflies and damselflies was assessed using IUCN’s Red List criteria. Distribution maps for each species were created and species were assigned to habitat types. These data were analysed in respect to threat level for regions and habitat types. We have found that one in 10 species of dragonflies and damselflies is threatened with extinction. This threat level is among the lowest of groups that have been assessed to date, suggesting that previous estimates of extinction risk for insects might be misleading. However, Odonata only comprise a small invertebrate order, with above-average dispersal ability and relatively wide distribution ranges. For conservation science and policy to be truly representative of global biodiversity a representative cross-section of invertebrates needs to be included.Attappady is a rural area in Kerala, South India, that has suffered from severe land degradation and which is inhabited by a poor and predominantly tribal population. The combination of severe land degradation, poverty and a tribal population make Attappady hydrologically and socially unique. Ecological degradation and deforestation followed the gradual building up of land pressure resulting from immigration by more wealthy outsiders. The hills of Attappady were once the forest land of Kerala. Recently it was on the verge of complete degradation.This paper explains how an ecorestoration project involving soil and water conservation interventions, the introduction of agro-forestry, nutritional diversification, income generation activities and training was implemented in a participatory manner. The project had positive impacts on both the environment and the livelihoods of the people living in the watershed, but it also suffered from drawbacks. This paper reports on the successes as well as the lessons learned from this unique ecorestoration project.Mangrove forests in South Asia occur along the tidal sea edge of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. These forests provide important ecosystem goods and services to the region\\'s dense coastal populations and support important functions of the biosphere. Mangroves are under threat from both natural and anthropogenic stressors; however the current status and dynamics of the region\\'s mangroves are poorly understood. We mapped the current extent of mangrove forests in South Asia and identified mangrove forest cover change (gain and loss) from 2000 to 2012 using Landsat satellite data. We also conducted three case studies in Indus Delta (Pakistan), Goa (India), and Sundarbans (Bangladesh and India) to identify rates, patterns, and causes of change in greater spatial and thematic details compared to regional assessment of mangrove forests.Our findings revealed that the areal extent of mangrove forests in South Asia is approximately 1,187,476\\xa0ha representing ∼7% of the global total. Our results showed that from 2000 to 2012, 92,135\\xa0ha of mangroves were deforested and 80,461\\xa0ha were reforested with a net loss of 11,673\\xa0ha. In all three case studies, mangrove areas have remained the same or increased slightly, however, the turnover was greater than the net change. Both, natural and anthropogenic factors are responsible for the change and turnover. The major causes of forest cover change are similar throughout the region; however, specific factors may be dominant in specific areas. Major causes of deforestation in South Asia include (i) conversion to other land use (e.g. conversion to agriculture, shrimp farms, development, and human settlement), (ii) over-harvesting (e.g. grazing, browsing and lopping, and fishing), (iii) pollution, (iv) decline in freshwater availability, (v) floodings, (vi) reduction of silt deposition, (vii) coastal erosion, and (viii) disturbances from tropical cyclones and tsunamis. Our analysis in the region\\'s diverse socio-economic and environmental conditions highlights complex patterns of mangrove distribution and change. Results from this study provide important insight to the conservation and management of the important and threatened South Asian mangrove ecosystem.This paper presents data on the impact of biotic pressure in terms of grazing by livestock and wood cutting by humans on the plant community in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve of India. Grass, and herbaceous plant biomass, number of cattle dung piles, number of woody stems available and damaged by human activities and weed biomass were assessed at different proximity along transects radiating from village-forest boundary to forest interior to measure the ecological impact of livestock grazing and fire wood collection. The grass biomass was positively correlated to overgrazing indicating the adverse effect on natural vegetation by cattle. Woodcutting was intense along the forest boundary and significantly declined as distance increased. Similarly, weed biomass and number of thorny species declined positively with proximity from village-forest boundary and the weed biomass was significantly higher in the pastoral sites compared to residential sites. The results suggest that human impact adversely affects natural vegetation and promotes weed proliferation in forest areas adjoining human settlements in the ecologically important Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Continued anthropogenic pressure could cause reduction in fodder availability to large herbivores like elephants, which in turn leads to an increase in human–elephant conflict.Pseudophilautus comprises an endemic diversification predominantly associated with the wet tropical regions of Sri Lanka that provides an opportunity to examine the effects of geography and historical climate change on diversification. Using a time-calibrated multi-gene phylogeny, we analyze the tempo of diversification in the context of past climate and geography to identify historical drivers of current patterns of diversity and distribution. Molecular dating suggests that the diversification was seeded by migration across a land-bridge connection from India during a period of climatic cooling and drying, the Oi-1 glacial maximum around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. Lineage-through-time plots suggest a gradual and constant rate of diversification, beginning in the Oligocene and extending through the late Miocene and early Pliocene with a slight burst in the Pleistocene. There is no indication of an early-burst phase of diversification characteristic of many adaptive radiations, nor were there bursts of diversification associated with favorable climate shifts such as the intensification of monsoons. However, a late Miocene (8.8 MYA) back-migration to India occurred following the establishment of the monsoon. The back migration did not trigger a diversification in India similar to that manifest in Sri Lanka, likely due to occupation of available habitat, and consequent lack of ecological opportunity, by the earlier radiation of a sister lineage of frogs (Raorchestes) with similar ecology. Phylogenetic area reconstructions show a pattern of sister species distributed across adjacent mountain ranges or from different parts of large montane regions, highlighting the importance of isolation and allopatric speciation. Hence, local species communities are composed of species from disparate clades that, in most cases, have been assembled through migration rather than in situ speciation. Lowland lineages are derived from montane lineages. Thus, the hills of Sri Lanka acted as species pumps as well as refuges throughout the 31 million years of evolution, highlighting the importance of tropical montane regions for both the generation and maintenance of biodiversity.The genus Chlorophytum consists of medicinally important species like Chlorophytum borivilianum, C.\\xa0tuberosum and C.\\xa0attenuatum. Uncontrolled harvest of this plant from wild habitat due to its high commercial value made the species of this genus be listed in the Red Data Book of Indian plants as an endangered species. In India, approximately nineteen species of Chlorophytum are found; out of these, only C.\\xa0borivilianum is cultivated commercially. The objective of this study was to measure genetic diversity, population structure and phylogenetic relationship among the species using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP). Fifteen pairs of primer (out of 64 primer pairs screened) were used to analyse the genetic diversity in eighteen species of genus Chlorophytum. Cluster analysis, estimation of the gene flow among the species and of the phylogeographic distribution of this genus were carried out using an AFLP data matrix. A high level of genetic diversity was observed on the basis of the percentage of polymorphic bands (99.91%), Shannon\\'s information index (0.3592) and Nei\\'s gene diversity (0.2085) at species level. Cluster analysis of UPGMA dendrogram, principal component analysis and Bayesian method analysis resolved these species in three different clusters, which was supported by morphological information. The Mantel test (r\\xa0=\\xa00.4432) revealed a significant positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances. The collected data have an important implication in the identification, authentication, and conservation of the species of the genus Chlorophytum.Protected areas (PAs) often depend on landscapes surrounding them to maintain flows of organisms, water, nutrients, and energy. Park managers have little authority over the surrounding landscape although land use change and infrastructure development can have major impacts on the integrity of a PA. The need for scientifically-based regional-scale land use planning around protected areas is acute in human-dominated landscapes to balance conservation goals with livelihood needs for fuelwood, fodder, and other ecosystem services. As a first step, we propose the designation of a “zone of interaction” (ZOI) around PAs that encompasses hydrologic, ecological, and socioeconomic interactions between a PA and the surrounding landscape. We illustrate the concept by delineating the ZOI in three Indian PAs – Kanha, Ranthambore, and Nagarahole – using remote sensing, population census, and field data. The ZOI in Ranthambore is three times the size of the park and is largely defined by the socioeconomic interactions with surrounding villages. Ranthambore is located in headwaters and wildlife corridors are largely severed. In Nagarahole, the ZOI is more than seven times larger than the park and includes upstream watershed and elephant corridors. Kanha’s ZOI is approximately four times larger than the park and is mostly defined by contiguous surrounding forest. The three examples highlight the differing extents of ZOIs when applying equivalent criteria, even though all are located in densely-populated landscapes. Quantitative understanding of which activities (e.g. collection of forest products, grazing, road construction, tourism development) and which locations within the ZOI are most crucial to conservation goals will enable improved land use planning around PAs in human-dominated landscapes.Thermally activated building system (TABS) is a hydronic cooling system, in which cold water is circulated through pipes embedded in the building structure to remove the heat from the indoor space. This paper proposes a hybrid passive cooling system, in which TABS is integrated with a cooling tower. The performance of this integrated system greatly depends on the climatic conditions of the geographical area. Hence, the feasibility of the proposed system to provide thermal comfort in twelve Indian cities spread over five different climatic regions is investigated using COMSOL Multiphysics. Different cooling scenarios like Roof and Floor cooled TABS (RF) and All Surfaces cooled TABS (AS) are compared. The proposed system performs well in arid and semi-arid regions, and the RF scenario is sufficient to achieve thermal comfort. The system is able to reduce the indoor operative temperature by 14\\xa0°C for the arid climatic conditions of Jaipur. In the other three regions, i.e., humid subtropical, tropical wet and dry and tropical wet regions, the performance of the proposed system is relatively low and the AS scenario is required to achieve thermal comfort.The use of various modeling approaches is critical in the assessment of ecosystem services. Although numerous assessments have been conducted as scholarly studies to quantify, map, and value ecosystem services, a well-structured platform is necessary to ensure consistency of the assessment approaches with regard to theories and practices. To identify gaps between practical ecosystem services assessments and scholarly studies in the Asian region, we reviewed assessment cases in the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) catalogue and peer-reviewed literature using Web platforms. We identified 31 assessment cases and 290 such peer-reviewed studies conducted throughout Asia. Our review of recent peer-reviewed studies revealed a bias in the geographic distribution, with numerous Chinese studies and few studies in West Asia. Our comparison of the approaches applied in the assessment cases with those in the peer-reviewed studies revealed that little information on the models was reported in the assessment cases, whereas the approaches used in the peer-reviewed studies were mostly modeling and biophysical indicators. Although the modeling and scenario approaches used in the actual assessments require further clarification in the IPBES catalogue, many scientific modeling studies have been conducted throughout Asia. These scientific data, however, are not easily accessible to those outside of academic communities. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a new catalogue to guide all the stakeholders involved in ecosystem services assessment at multiple scales.A taxonomic revision of Stenosiphonium Nees is provided. Morphological variation within the genus is documented, the relationship between Stenosiphonium and Strobilanthes Blume is discussed, and problems of species delimitation are resolved. Three species are recognized. Stenosiphonium cordifolium (Vahl) Alston is morphologically variable and is widespread throughout peninsular India and Sri Lanka. S. setosum T. Anderson and S. wightii Bremek. are restricted endemics from the southern Western Ghats, each known from very few herbarium collections. BothS. setosum and S. wightii are recognized as rare in accordance with IUCN criteria. There is evidence to suggest that all three species of Stenosiphonium are plietesial which may explain the paucity of herbarium collections of bothS. setosum and S. wightii. The implications of a plietesial life history strategy for the assessment of the conservation status of these species is considered.Climate change and its cascading impacts are being increasingly recognized as a major challenge across the globe. Climate is one of the most critical factors affecting biomes and their distribution. The present study assessed shifts in biome types of India using the conceptual framework of Holdridge life zone (HLZ) model, minimum distance classifier and climatic datasets to assess the distribution pattern of potential biomes under climate change scenarios in India. Modelling was conducted on the entire region of India using various combinations; (i) current climate scenario, and, (ii) increased temperature and precipitation scenario. The geographical analysis identifies nineteen (19) HLZs in the Indian sub-continent; seven (7) biomes and nineteen (19) sub-biomes. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the biome map prepared for current climate scenario was 82.73% and 0.75, respectively. With the changes in increasing temperature and precipitation scenario, the modelling results predict significant decrease in the area cover for tropical deserts (plains), tropical desert scrubs (lower montane), tropical moist forests (lower montane) and tropical wet forests (lower montane). Along with these changes, there have been substantial increases in the area cover for tropical dry forests (plains) and tropical very dry forests (plains), especially in central and southern India. The results show shifts from very dry tundra (alvar) to dry tundra (alpine) and moist tundra (alpine) and in some places tropical moist forests (sub-alpine) as well. In central India, decrease in tropical moist forests (lower montane) has been observed, while an increase in the area cover of tropical rain forests (plains) in northeastern India has been observed. It is important to understand the impacts and vulnerabilities of projected climate change on forest ecosystems so that better management and conservation strategies can be adopted for biodiversity and forest dependent communities. The knowledge of impact mechanisms will identify adaptation strategies for some conditions which will help in decreasing the susceptibility to anticipated climate change in the forest sector.This paper deals with participatory research on the introduction and use of coir geotextiles for soil and water conservation in a small community pond in a watershed in south India. The results demonstrate that a participatory approach enables the community to visualize and evaluate the impact of innovative technologies. As a result, farmers readily adapt a technology when they have experienced the positive research outcome. This reduces the adoption time, and can bring significant increase in yield, or decrease in labour costs, helping to enhance productivity, sustainability and improvement of livelihood.ObjectiveTo report the patterns of species diversity, and regenerating capacity in the forest of Nikyal valley in relation to environmental variables and underlying anthropogenic influence.MethodsA study area was selected in a traditionally managed mountain woody pasture during July 2012 to June 2013. The area was sampled by quadrat method. The quadrats were laid down at regular intervals of 150 m. The size of quadrats was kept 10×10, 5×5 and 1×1 m2 for trees, shrubs and herbs respectively. Density, frequency and cover were recorded. Importance value index of each plant species was calculated and plant communities were named after the plant species having the highest IV. Then diversity, its components and regenerating capacity were calculated with their formulas.ResultsShannon\\'s diversity ranged from 2.75 to 3.31, Simpson\\'s diversity, 0.90 to 0.95; Menhinick\\'s diversity, 0.83 to 1.19; evenness, 0.41 to 0.65; species richness, 4.89 to 6.08 and maturity index, 30 to 44 species distribution pattern. Diversity values were similar to the other Himalayan forests. Pinus roxburghaii was the only regenerating species whereas the remaining four tree species including Qurecus dilatata regenerate up to 100 cm; they are at extreme risk of elimination due to anthropogenic factors.ConclusionsNikyal valley is under severe deforestation pressure for fuel and timber value. There is an urgent need to promote the ethics among the people that improvement and conservation of natural resources are critical for land and soil management.e the dependency on fossil fuels, the renewable energy systems must be utilized in an interactive manner and need to be optimized. Currently, the thermal energy demand of any city is mostly satisfied by the conventional resources. It produces considerable strain on fossile fuel reserves and lead to increase green house gas emissions also. The thermal demand of city can be satisfied by integrative use of renewable energy resources. This integrative use needs modelling and optimization. In this paper, optimised combinations of three renewable energy systems, such as solar water heating systems, biomass gasifiers and biogas energy systems are presented to satisfy the thermal demand of a region. A Microsoft excel optimizer software is used to solve the multiobjective optimization problem to find the optimum combinations. Minimization of lifecycle cost and CO2 emission are considered as main two multiobjectives. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to solve the constraint optimization problem. The thermal energy demand satisfaction of Kolhapur city, a midtown city, in western Maharashtra, India, is taken for case study. The daily average thermal energy demand of one day for each month is satisfied in this case study for the whole year.Calls to eliminate nature/culture dualities in favor of nondualist ontologies present analytical challenges; how might we approach entangled socionatural worlds in ways that neither reduce the complexity and diversity of human experience and yet also allow nonhuman agents their ‘voices’? The disparate analytical vocabularies of the human and natural sciences were not designed for this purpose. The use of ecological concepts in anthropology has been contentious, while humans have continued to be located outside of most ecological thinking. Comparative analysis of past empires provides an opportunity to address this challenge. If we view the actions of past empires in terms of their environmental effects, we can also conceptualize these effects as specific forms of ecological action. Using the concept of ‘ecosystem engineer,’ this essay explores how this concept may facilitate comparison of imperial and colonial systems and, critically, how it may inflect and improve anthropogenic land cover change (ALCC) models which posit historical relationships between past population and land cover. At the same time, this exercise points to the analytical limits of this concept and perhaps of nondualist ontologies themselves.The terminology used to describe Palaeolithic industries has an important impact upon our interpretation of past behaviour. In South Asia, the term Late Palaeolithic is employed to refer to Late Pleistocene microlithic industries, distinguishing them chronologically from Holocene Mesolithic industries, and technologically from preceding Middle Palaeolithic technologies. Historically, however, an intermediate technological stage between Middle Palaeolithic and microlithic industries has been recognised and called ‘Upper’ Palaeolithic. Examining whether these ‘Upper’ Palaeolithic industries fit contemporary definitions of Middle or Late Palaeolithic technologies, distinct diversity within one of these technologies or a transitional phase between the two is therefore necessary to reintegrate these ‘Upper’ Palaeolithic sites into current debate. This is a particularly timely issue as the connection between some Late Palaeolithic artefact types, particularly backed microliths, and the earliest modern human populations in South Asia no longer appears tenable, and thus a rush to identify the earliest appearance of microliths must give way to more detailed examinations of behavioural variability. This paper re-examines lithic assemblages from Buddha Pushkar, western India, originally reported as an ‘Upper’ Palaeolithic industry. An attribute study of metric and categorical variables recorded on stone tools is used to examine how flaking technology, raw material use and reduction intensity vary within and between these assemblages. The results indicate raw material choices had a marked impact on stone tool technologies, nested within a pattern of technological diversity in western India during the terminal Pleistocene that complement models of regional trajectories in the evolution of Late Palaeolithic technologies.Forest carbon (C) estimates are the key inputs to the understanding of the global C cycle. We report the estimates of forest carbon pool and its spatial distribution in the Indian forests for the years 1994 and 2010 at 5\\xa0km grid level. This study improves upon earlier spatial estimates of Indian forest biomass carbon by using data from a robustly designed National Forest Inventory (NFI). The realized sampling intensity has addressed the large heterogeneity of the Indian forest types and allowed the computation of 5\\xa0km grid level forest C, yielding a realistic estimate of forest biomass C in Indian forests. Forest cover density maps were intersected with 5\\xa0km mesh and estimates of forest area, forest carbon density for each Agro-ecological sub region and forest carbon pools were linked to the 5\\xa0km grid coverage of India. National forest carbon estimates for the years 1994 and 2010 are 3911.78 and 4368.03\\xa0TgC respectively, and these estimates showed a net increase of 456.25\\xa0TgC in 16\\xa0years. Uncertainty of the estimates has been addressed spatially. Mean forest carbon density increased from 61.14\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1 in 1994 to 64.08\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1 in 2010. C densities for dense and open forest in 1994 estimated as 77.08 and 38.47\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1 with total C pools of 2895.28\\xa0TgC and 1016.50\\xa0TgC which has increased to 80.24\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1 and 41.69\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1 with total C pools of 3176.48\\xa0TgC and 1191.55\\xa0TgC in 2010. This study provides the first 5\\xa0km level C analysis for Indian forests. Spatial distribution of C shows large differences in C density over Indian forests indicating that estimates of the spatial distribution of C are even more important than the total C pool estimates of the country.ObjectiveTo identify and understand the utilization and prioritization of medicinal plants used as tooth sticks by the select communities of Andaman and Nicobar islands.MethodsThe information was collected through questionnaires and discussions among the informants in their local language regarding the plant parts used.ResultsA total of 11 plant species belonging to 10 genera and 8 families were enumerated as tooth sticks, used by the Chota Nagpuri and Tamil inhabitants of Andaman and Nicobar islands to treat dental caries.ConclusionThe most important plant species harvested for tooth sticks belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae (3 species) and important as the tribal have used these plants since time immemorial and found effective in their teeth and gums health and this study has scopes on the conservation of certain medicinal plants, through sustainable utilization.This article provides an environmental and institutional history of the highly politicized and contested process of setting a Net Present Value (NPV) for forests in India, in a context of increasing conflicts over land for development, conservation and indigenous rights. Decision-making documents in the Supreme Court and in one specific case of a bauxite mining conflict involving Vedanta in the Niyamgiri hills are studied to come to conclusions about how economic valuation of forests has moved through the political process. We argue that establishing NPV for forests is neither conducive to conservation nor to environmental justice for the following three reasons. The technical and political process of setting prices deepens and reproduces structural inequalities with negative distributive effects. NPV encourages economistic decision-making procedures that exclude participation. Finally NPV does not recognize or take into account cultural difference or plural values. We thus conclude that economic valuation of forest products and services has not managed to “save” forests in India and is not an effective or viable strategy for expressing the value of forests or for environmental conservation and environmental justice activism.Labeo rohita, popularly known as rohu is a widely cultured species in the whole Indian subcontinent. Knowledge of the genetic diversity of this species is important to support management and conservation programs which will subsequently help in sustainable production of this species. DNA markers, mostly microsatellite markers are excellent tool to evaluate genetic variation of populations. Genetic variation of three wild and one farm population was assessed using eleven microsatellite loci. In analyzing 192 samples, the number of alleles ranged from 4 to 23; observed heterozygosity 0.500 to 0.870 and expected heterozygosity from 0.389 to 0.878. Exact test for Hardy Weinberg disequilibrium revealed that each riverine sample had at least one locus not in equilibrium except one river. Negative inbreeding coefficients (FIS) were observed across populations indicating very high level of genetic diversity but little genetic differentiation among populations.This review study aimed to decipher distribution of trace metals (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Ni, Mn, V, and Zn) in different compartments and human health risk in the Sundarbans mangrove ecosystems. The literature suggested relatively higher contamination of soils and sediments than fish, crustaceans, and water. Cd, Fe, Ni, and Pb are most likely to accumulate in roots of mangrove trees, while Al, As, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, and Zn tend to accumulate in the leaves. According to human health risk studies, fish consumption is the main route of trace metals exposure to human. Majority of the studies conducted in the Indian Sundarbans; whereas, in Bangladesh part, there is an evident lack of such kind of studies. Finally, this review highlights the foremost data and research gaps, which will help to refine the risk of trace metals and scarcity of researches in the Sundarbans mangrove ecosystem.The late Cretaceous Corsinipollenites from central India and its nearest living fossil pollen Ludwigia from Pleistocene Karewa sediments in Kashmir shows morphometrical affinities with pollen of seven extant Ludwigia species (L. octovalvis (Jacq) P.H. Raven, L. octovalvis subsp. sessiliflora (M.Micheli) Raven, L. adscendens (L.) H. Hara, L. perennis (L.), L. hyssopifolia (G.Don) Exell, L. peruviana (L.) H. Hara and L. decurrens Walt.) commonly growing in swampy ecosystems of India. The Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Light Microscope (LM) study draws plausible lineage of extant Ludwigia species with that of fossil specimens recovered at two different time frames based on similarities in pollen morphometry. The pollen aperture and its character along with the sexine pattern were main identifiable features to distinguish different species of extant/fossil Ludwigia pollen. The aspidote aperture varies from brevi-colporate to slit-like colpi (colporate). The sexine is stenopalynous type characterized by rugulate to reti-rugulate pattern. The multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on the numerical data obtained from pollen morphometry of living and fossil Ludwigia spp. The Pleistocene Ludwigia morphotype with slit-like colpi shows close proximity to L. octovalvis, L. octovalvis subsp. sessiliflora and L. adscendens. However, Late Cretaceous, Corsinipollenitis characterized by brevicolpi is closer to L. perennis and L. hyssopifolia with respect to primary pollen characters and inferred as primitive species having lineage to the “Old World” (paleotropical) species. A short pollen key of Ludwigia spp., is presented here to enable the identification of living/fossil pollen.The present study emphasizes the long-term (1992–2012) land alteration and its driving factors in the Tamiraparani sub-basin, south India. The multi-temporal landuse/land cover features were extracted from the Landsat images (TM and ETM+, 30\\xa0m resolution) using a supervised classification technique with maximum likelihood classifier. The extracted features were classified into various landuse/ land cover categories with level I classification scheme of NRSC, India. Six major landuse classes such as forest, settlement, barren land, water bodies, agricultural land and fallow land were recognized. The overall accuracy for the year 1992, 2002, and 2012 shows 85.55%, 82.81% and 83.59% respectively. The overall Kappa coefficients for the datasets are near to 0.8, which indicates acceptable accuracy for landuse/ land cover classification. The results reveals that the spatial extent of forest, settlement and barren land has evolved in the past 20 years but, the water bodies, agricultural land and fallow land has reduced significantly. The reduction in agricultural land in the study area for the past 20 years is due to the combination of natural environment and socio-economic factors such as low rainfall in the plains, increased surface temperature, reduced soil moisture condition, high rate of evapo-transpiration, reduced water storage level in the reservoirs and ponds, and reduced vegetation cover. These factors are linked with climate change, it alters the socio-economic condition of the area, and such situation will affect the overall ecosystem in the Tamiraparani sub-basin in the near future.An optimal operation plan has been developed for the reservoirs in Kuttiadi river basin in Kerala using systems approach. A system consists of three reservoirs namely; Banasurasagar in Wayanad district,Kakkayam and Peruvannamuzhi in Kozhikode district has been taken for the study. Banasurasagar reservoir is in Kabbini river basin, which is an east flowing river and the remaining two are in Kuttiadi river basin, which is a west flowing river. They serve different purposes such as irrigation, domestic water supply and hydropower generation. These purposes were fulfilled based on the Standard Linear Operation Policy (SLOP) developed during the early stages of project formulation. Considering the deficit of water in the region, a system study has been done using multi-reservoir multi-purpose simulation technique, in which reservoir rule curve- based policy to optimally utilize the conservation storage of these three reservoirs have been developed. The generalised simulation model developed at the National Institute of Hydrology has been used to derive the rule levels and simulation of the system. The simulation studies reveal that the Banasurasagar reservoir and Peruvannamuzhi reservoir always serve the purposes of water supply without fail. For Banasurasagar reservoir, irrigation and water supply reliability is found to be 86% where as for Peruvanannamuzhi reservoir, it is 77%. The demand for power generation can be met with 90% dependability. Reservoir linked water supply can be thought of from Banasurasagar reservoir to Wayanad district like water supply from Peruvannamuzhi reservoir to Kozhikode district.Information on the spatial distribution of Hydrologically Active Areas (HAAs) in a watershed is an important input for many applications, such as hydrological modeling, water resource planning and flood estimation. HAAs can be delineated using a wetness index derived from either a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) or from satellite data. The purpose of this study was to develop and apply a methodology to delineate the HAAs in the Harangi (535 km2) and Hemavathy (2974 km2) watersheds located in Karnataka, India. Spatial distributions of HAAs derived from the DEM and from satellite data (Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor) were compared. It was found that wetness index obtained from satellite data was better able to capture the HAAs in comparison to the use of DEM. The delineated HAAs will be useful in identifying runoff generation areas and improve process representation in distributed hydrological modeling of the watershed.Kochi is a rapidly growing commercial, industrial and trading centre of Kerala. Due to the tremendous growth and urbanization, the density of population in city is increasing every year. These factors have resulted in land use stresses, reducing open areas especially wetlands [1] in Kochi city for the past decades through land reclamation and encroachments. Again, anthropogenic activities like industrialisation, improper management of sewage and other solid waste lead to degradation of these ecosystems. This study discusses about the unique status of wetlands of Kadamakudypanchayat of Kochi with its Pokkali fields [2], fish farms. It also tries to propose guidelines, strategies and action plan at site specific level for development, conserving its wetlands along with its wise use in an ecological perspective keeping in mind the rapid urbanisation.The population structure of three dioecious species, Diospyros montana, Diospyros sylvatica and Garcinia talbotii was studied in a seasonal cloud forest in the Western Ghats of India. In an undisturbed, natural population of D. montana, female fecundity was not significantly influenced by distance to neighbours or by flower numbers on neighbours. In the same population fruit set was also unrelated to the angular dispersion of neighbours. On the other hand, in an altered population of this species in which conspecifics are extremely isolated due to human activities, insect visitation and fruit set were strongly and negatively correlated with distance to the nearest male. Moreover, the number of insects and fruit set in the natural population were significantly higher in the natural population than in the altered population. In the natural population, trees of large girth produced larger numbers of flowers in both sexes and females which produced larger numbers of flowers, also produced more fruits and fruit set (fruits/flower). In the altered population, fruit numbers and fruit set in female trees were unrelated to the flower numbers, which is possibly due to pollination limitation as a result of inadequate pollinator visits at female trees. Sex ratios were male-biased (3.7:1) in the natural population and female-biased (1:2) in the altered population of D. montana, as well as in G. talbotii (1:3.8) and D. sylvatica (1:12.2) populations where the lower girth classes are mainly cut. The girth class distribution of G. talbotii and D. sylvatica populations was skewed towards larger girths suggesting that future recruitment will be severely affected.Ethnopharmacological relevanceMore than 15,000 angiosperm species are dioecious, i.e., having distinct male and female individual plants. The allocation of resources between male and female plants is different, and also variation in secondary metabolites and sex-biased herbivory is reported among dioecious plants. However, little is known about the ethnobotany of dioecious species and whether preferences exist for a specific gender, e.g., in food, medicine or timber.Aim of the studyThe aim of this study was: 1) to study whether Indian folk healers have preference for plant genders, and to document their knowledge and use of dioecious species; 2) to understand the concept of plant gender in Indian systems of medicine and folk medicine, and whether Ayurvedic literature includes any references to gender preference.Materials and methodsLists of dioecious plants used in Indian systems of medicine and folk medicine were compiled. Ethnobotanical data was collected on perceptions and awareness of dioecious plants, and preferences of use for specific genders of dioecious species using semi-structured interviews with folk healers in Tamil Nadu, India. In addition, twenty Ayurvedic doctors were interviewed to gain insight into the concept of plant gender in Ayurveda.ResultsIndian systems of medicine contain 5–7% dioecious species, and this estimate is congruent with the number of dioecious species in flowering plants in general. Informants recognized the phenomenon of dioecy in 31 out of 40 species, and reported gender preferences for 13 species with respect to uses as timber, food and medicine. Among informants different plant traits such as plant size, fruit size, and visibility of fruits determines the perception of a plant being a male or female. Ayurvedic classical literature provides no straightforward evidence on gender preferences in preparation of medicines or treatment of illness, however it contains details about reproductive morphology and sexual differentiation of plants.ConclusionsA knowledge gap exists in ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological literature on traditional knowledge of dioecious plants. From this explorative study it is evident that people have traditional knowledge on plant gender and preferential usages towards one gender. Based on this, we propose that researchers conducting ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological studies should consider documenting traditional knowledge on sexual systems of plants, and test the existence of gender specific usages in their conceptual framework and hypothesis testing. Incorporating such concepts could provide new dimensions of scientific knowledge with potential implications to conservation biology, chemical ecology, ethnoecology and drug discovery.In this study, the production of camptothecine and its derivatives, in thirteen species of the family Icacinaceae, namely, Apodytes dimidiata, Codiocarpus andamanicus, Gomphandra comosa, Gomphandra coriacea, Gomphandra polymorpha, Gomphandra tetrandra, Iodes cirrhosa, Iodes hookeriana, Miquelia dentata, Miquelia kleinii, Natsiatum herpeticum, Pyrenacantha volubilis and Sarcostigma kleinii is reported. Seeds of M. dentata were found to produce the highest content of camptothecine (1.0–1.4% by dry weight of seeds). Full scan LC–MS and ESI-MS/MS analysis of M. dentata revealed, besides camptothecine, a number of other derivatives, namely, 10-hydroxycamptothecine, 9-methoxycamptothecine, 20-deoxycamptothecine. Crude extract preparations of the seeds of M. dentata were effective against a breast cancer cell line (IC50\\xa0=\\xa03.82\\xa0μg/ml for MDA MB273 cell lines) and two ovarian cancer cell lines (IC50\\xa0=\\xa02.8\\xa0μg/ml for NCI/ADR-RES and 4.5\\xa0μg/ml for SKOV). These results are the first reports of camptothecine and its derivatives in these species and offer rich alternative plant sources for the anticancer compound, camptothecine.Soil physical degradation is a major environmental problem throughout the world due to its negative impact on biomass and economic production. This study presented new ways of combining rapid soil analysis using GIS and remote sensing imagery to provide a precision mapping of soil physical condition indicators in the study area and producing fertility status using Geostatistical approach. Study has been carried out to map the areas with physical degradation using remotely sensed data from Indian Remote Sensing LISS III sensor. It was observed that the data enabled better delineation of small units of eroded areas. Satellite data have been used for qualitative assessment of areas, being subject to soil erosion. Soil erosion was found to be none or slight to very sever using visual interpretation of IRS data along with field survey method where soil erosion was found to be moderate to high using the RUSLE method. The eroded areas of degraded lands will be used as an input for planning reclamation and conservation programs in Chamarajanagar district of Karnataka.Soil compaction is a form of physical degradation resulting in densification and distortion of the soil where biological activity, porosity and permeability are reduced, strength is increased and soil structure partly destroyed. Compaction can reduce water infiltration capacity and increase erosion risk by accelerating run-off. The compaction process can be initiated by wheels, tracks, rollers or by the passage of animals. Some soils are naturally compacted, strongly cemented or have a thin topsoil layer on rock subsoil. Soils can vary from being sufficiently strong to resist all likely applied loads to being so weak that they are compacted by even light loads.The use of biofuels can result on a decrease of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when compared to fossil fuels. However, the expansion of biofuels crops has been either based on direct or indirect displacement of natural ecosystems or on the use of degraded or marginal lands. The former results in direct habitat loss, whereas the later results in usual agricultural impacts (e.g., soil and biotic contamination and water eutrophication). However, in some circumstances biofuels crops can result on an increase in biodiversity compared to other agricultural crops. Agricultural zoning can mitigate the impacts of land use change (LUC), either direct (dLUC) or indirect (iLUC), whereas the use of wildlife-friendly techniques can mitigate the impacts of agriculture intensification. However, in both cases long-term biodiversity monitoring programs should be established in order to help the decision making process concerning the conflict between the expansion of biofuels crops and the conservation of biodiversity.This study presents a global analysis of forest cover and forest protection. An updated Global Forest Map (using MODIS2005) provided a current assessment of forest cover within 20 natural forest types. This map was overlaid onto WWF realms and ecoregions to gain additional biogeographic information on forest distribution. Using the 2008 World Database on Protected Areas, percentage forest cover protection was calculated globally, within forest types, realms and ecoregions, and within selected areas of global conservation importance. At the 10% tree cover threshold, global forest cover was 39\\xa0million\\xa0km2. Of this, 7.7% fell within protected areas under IUCN management categories I–IV. With the inclusion of IUCN categories V and VI, the level of global forest protection increased to 13.5%. Percentage forest protection (IUCN I–IV) varied greatly between realms from 5.5% (Palearctic) to 13.4% (Australasia), and for forest types from 3.2% (temperate freshwater swamp forest) to 28% (temperate broadleaf evergreen forest). Median protection of forest cover in 670 ecoregions (forest above a specified threshold) was 5.9% (IUCN I–IV); at IUCN I–VI, 46% of the ecoregions had less than 10% forest protection. Considering their biodiversity importance, forest protection within global priority areas was insufficient, e.g., median protection of 8.4% in biodiversity hotspots (IUCN I–IV). Results have policy relevance in terms of the target of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), reconfirmed in 2008, to effectively conserve “at least 10% of each of the world’s forest types”. Regular updates of these analyses would allow progress towards achieving that target to be monitored.The paper provides a deep insight into the managerial aspects of Indian mangroves and highlights the transition of Indian forest policies and their impacts on these extensive coastal ecosystems. Citing examples from historical past to the recent developing era, the paper highlights the transition of core mangrove management strategies and observes a paradigm shift from preventive to ameliorative management mostly through increased community participation in mainstream resource management. The paper also examines the existing framework of mangrove management, legislative and non-legislative provisions for conservation and identifies it\\'s effectively against the persisting extinction threats. Addressing the major gaps and challenges, the paper concludes with some key recommended strategies for an effective mangrove management in India.Bushmint (Hyptis suaveolens (L.) Poit.) is one among the world\\'s most noxious weeds. Bushmint is rapidly invading tropical ecosystems across the world, including India, and is major threat to native biodiversity, ecosystems and livelihoods. Knowledge about the likely areas under bushmint invasion has immense importance for taking rapid response and mitigation measures. In the present study, we model the potential invasion range of bushmint in India and investigate prediction capabilities of two popular species distribution models (SDM) viz., MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) and GARP (Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Production). We compiled spatial layers on 22 climatic and non-climatic (soil type and land use land cover) environmental variables at India level and selected least correlated 14 predictor variables. 530 locations of bushmint along with 14 predictor variables were used to predict bushmint distribution using MaxEnt and GARP. We demonstrate the relative contribution of predictor variables and species-environmental linkages in modeling bushmint distribution. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess each model\\'s performance and robustness. GARP had a relatively lower area under curve (AUC) score (AUC: 0.75), suggesting its lower ability in discriminating the suitable/unsuitable sites. Relative to GARP, MaxEnt performed better with an AUC value of 0.86. Overall the outputs of MaxEnt and GARP matched in terms of geographic regions predicted as suitable/unsuitable for bushmint in India, however, predictions were closer in the spatial extent in Central India and Western Himalayan foothills compared to North-East India, Chottanagpur and Vidhayans and Deccan Plateau in India.Global and regional species conservation efforts are hindered by poor distribution data and range maps. Many Indian primates face extinction, but assessments of population status are hindered by lack of reliable distribution data. We estimated the current occurrence and distribution of 15 Indian primates by applying occupancy models to field data from a country-wide survey of local experts. We modeled species occurrence in relation to ecological and social covariates (protected areas, landscape characteristics, and human influences), which we believe are critical to determining species occurrence in India. We found evidence that protected areas positively influence occurrence of seven species and for some species are their only refuge. We found evergreen forests to be more critical for some primates along with temperate and deciduous forests. Elevation negatively influenced occurrence of three species. Lower human population density was positively associated with occurrence of five species, and higher cultural tolerance was positively associated with occurrence of three species. We find that 11 primates occupy less than 15% of the total land area of India. Vulnerable primates with restricted ranges are Golden langur, Arunachal macaque, Pig-tailed macaque, stump-tailed macaque, Phayre’s leaf monkey, Nilgiri langur and Lion-tailed macaque. Only Hanuman langur and rhesus macaque are widely distributed. We find occupancy modeling to be useful in determining species ranges, and in agreement with current species ranking and IUCN status. In landscapes where monitoring efforts require optimizing cost, effort and time, we used ecological and social covariates to reliably estimate species occurrence and focus species conservation efforts.An ethnomedicinal survey (1998–2000) was conducted in three villages of Shimoga district of Karnataka, India, using a questionnaire designed by Sinha (1996) [Sinha, R.K., 1996. Ethnobotany—The Renaissance of Traditional Herbal Medicine. Ina Shree Publishers, Jaipur, India, 242 pp.]. The herbal practitioners in the study area were interviewed and information on medicinal plants, their local names, habitat and their seasonal availability was collected. The survey revealed the utilization of 47 species of plants belonging to 46 genera in 28 families used to treat 9 infectious and 16 non-infectious diseases. Twelve new claims on ethnomedical knowledge were reported and there were formulations that were similar to that described already in the literature.A sloping field is not only vulnerable to soil erosion it may also suffer from soil moisture deficiency. Farmers that cultivate on slopes everywhere face similar problems. Conservation technologies may reduce soil and nutrient losses, and thus enhance water holding capacity and soil fertility. But although these technologies promote sustainable crop production on steep slopes, the construction of physical structure such as bench terraces are often labour intensive and expensive to the farmers, since construction and maintenance require high investments. Here we studied the efficiency of coir geotextile with and without crop cultivation in reducing soil moisture deficiency on marginal slopes in Kerala, India. From the results it is evident that the slopes treated with geotextile and crops have the highest moisture retention capacity followed by geotextiles alone, and that the control plot has the lowest moisture retention capacity. As the poor and marginal farmers occupy the highland region, this method provides an economically viable option for income generation and food security along with slope stabilization.A new species of scorpion of the genus Neoscorpiops Vachon, 1980 is described from Northern Maharashtra. Neoscorpiops maharashtraensis sp. nov. is a medium-sized scorpion species ranging from 36 to 42\\xa0mm. Carapace, mesosoma and metasoma brown, legs and telson yellow; pedipalp in a shade of brown with carinae dark drown to black. Granulation on carapace coarse, with a few smooth patches; on mesosoma, which is restricted to the posterior half. Anterior margin of carapace with a moderately deep “U”-shaped emargination medially lacking elevated edges. Pectines well developed 7/7. Trichobothria on patella ventral 13–16. Pedipalp chela narrow and elongate in males, length-to-width ratio in males is 4.86–5.05.Micro-watershed level planning requires a host of interrelated information to be generated and studied in relation to each other. An attempt has been made to assess the resource potential of Nambiar Watershed by the integration of remote sensing and GIS techniques to identify and evaluate the land quality and water resources. Different thematic maps have been prepared with the aid of visual interpretation keys, using IRS P6, LISS IV data and SOI topographical maps and relevant secondary data. Land and water resources are assessed individually integrating information derived from the remote sensing satellite data. By combining both land resources with water resources using the GIS techniques, a composite map on the Resource Potential Zones (RPZ) were created.The integrated resource analysis has proved to be efficient in categorizing the watershed as excellent to poor based on the weightage given and the suitability of the land parcels for a particular land use was assessed. The present study helps in the strategic management of water, agriculture, forest and other natural resources for the sustainable development of the Nambiar watershed that runs across Nanguneri Taluk in Tirunelveli district in TamilNadu state in India.The role of well-functioning markets for development is now widely recognized. However the challenge remains to make these markets benefit the poor and the environment. Increasing attention is being given to the potential role markets can play for agrobiodiversity conservation through product diversification and increasing competitiveness in niche and novelty markets. Several case studies were undertaken that explore the use of market-based approaches to on-farm agrobiodiversity management and livelihood improvement. This paper explores how the theory of collective action can provide a more synthetic understanding of how market chains operate, and the changes that could permit a more equitable distribution of benefits. The case studies illustrate the need for improved trust, mutual understanding of each actor’s involvement, and an agreed process of collective action with a high level of community participation. The cases differ in their degree of collective action, the level of market organization and the ways in which handling, processing, and innovative marketing add value to the agrobiodiversity products. Comparative analysis identified a range of situations in which market development can support agrobiodiversity conservation and livelihoods.Passive margins are geomorphological features that have historically attracted much attention from the modeling community. In particular, many numerical modeling studies have attempted to explain the longevity of steep escarpments that formed along continental edges at the transition between low elevation coastal plains and high elevation continental interiors, such as along the coasts of Africa and South America on both sides of the South Atlantic Ocean. In this paper, I review the wide and diverse body of observational constraints gathered to constrain the formation and evolution of passive margins escarpments, as well as the various mechanisms that have been proposed to explain their anomalously high topography. I then compile and summarize the findings of numerous numerical modeling studies that have been performed in the past twenty years to explain their formation and evolution. I show that many of these studies converged to agree that the longevity of passive margin escarpments depends on how rapidly they become and remain regional drainage divides and that this is primarily controlled by the flexural isostatic rebound associated with the erosion of the high elevation continental interior. To better quantify these findings, I derive and present a new analytical expression for the migration velocity of an escarpment once it has become a drainage divide. This expression is validated by a series of numerical experiments using 1D and 2D high resolution landscape evolution models. Interestingly, these models also predict that the rate of erosion at or near escarpments can be several orders of magnitude smaller than the rate of escarpment retreat. This may explain the apparent discrepancy between the low estimates of present-day erosion rates obtained mostly from cosmogenic nuclide studies (10m/Myr) and the long-term rates of escarpment retreat (1km/Myr).Orchids have been used traditionally in various herbal preparations of which Dendrobium thyrsiflorum deserves special mention. However, in spite of being such an important medicinal plant taxa, information on the genetic diversity of the orchids is limited. In order to establish an association with antioxidant activity of D. thyrsiflorum, five geographically distinct populations of D. thyrsiflorum were analyzed. Total phenolics, flavonoids and alkaloid contents along with antioxidant activity measured by 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays revealed a significant level of variability across populations. Higher phytochemical activity was recorded in the representatives from Sikkim as compared to those from Mizoram. The genetic information obtained from fifty genotypes sampled from five natural populations using nine AFLP markers exhibited a total of 1207 scorable peaks of which 1188 peaks were polymorphic with high genetic diversity [percentage polymorphic bands (PPB)-98.50%; Shannon\\'s index (I)- 0.42 and Nei\\'s Gene Diversity index (h)\\xa0=\\xa00.28]. Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) revealed that variation amongst the populations was significantly higher than within the populations. Both UPGMA and STRUCTURE analyses were employed to estimate the genetic relationships of D. thyrsiflorum germplasm. Interestingly, both methods revealed similar grouping patterns. Further, statistical analysis of molecular data revealed that four out of these nine AFLP markers tested were found to be correlated with the antioxidant activity measured by DPPH assay. With no available genetic information like linkage maps and Quantative trait loci (QTL) available, the present research finding can be utilized for conservation strategy formulation of this important medicinal orchid with high antioxidant activity.Sloping hills ravaged by shifting cultivation often causes soil erosion problems in the downstream cultivated lands. This study was carried out in the highland zone of Eastern India to evaluate selected horti-silvi-pastoral systems in terms of soil carbon build up, soil aggregation and soil moisture retention in a degraded sloping land. The experiment was taken up during 2000–2006 in a degraded hillock of about 4.0\\xa0ha area with eight treatments involving two fruit species (cashew and guava), two grass species (Stylosanthes hamata and natural grass) and two in situ (trench or no-trench) moisture conservation measures. Hedge rows of Indigofera teysmanni (silviculture component) were used uniformly for all the treatments. Trenches of 0.45\\xa0m\\xa0×\\xa00.45\\xa0m\\xa0×\\xa01.0\\xa0m dimension at 0.5\\xa0m\\xa0u/s side of fruit plants conserved 2.18\\xa0g\\xa0100\\xa0g−1 higher soil moisture on an average in the 0–30\\xa0cm layer. The effect of fruit tree component was visible during 6th year of study in terms of soil organic carbon (SOC) only. In 6 years, the average increase in SOC and water stable aggregates in the 0–30\\xa0cm profile was 89% and 46% under rehabilitation treatments. The SOC stock at the end of 6 years was 34–40\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1 in the 0–30\\xa0cm profile under treatments as compared to 21\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1 under control. The SOC build up rate increased linearly with time and the average rates were 4.5, 3.5 and 0.64\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1\\xa0yr−1 for Stylosanthes and natural grass based treatments and control, respectively. In all the systems, macroaggregates (>250\\xa0μm) were higher in proportion and contained higher organic carbon. Guava\\xa0+\\xa0Stylosanthes\\xa0+\\xa0Trench system proved better in terms of soil carbon build up, soil aggregation and soil moisture retention.Study regionIndia.Study focusIndia has a wealth of wetland ecosystems that support diverse and unique habitats. These wetlands provide numerous ecological goods and services but are under tremendous stress due to rapid urbanization, industrialization and agricultural intensification, manifested by the shrinkage in their areal extent, and decline in the hydrological, economic and ecological functions they perform. This paper reviews the wetland wealth of India in terms of their geographic distribution and extent, ecosystem benefits they provide, and the various stresses they are exposed to. The paper also discusses the efforts at management of these fragile ecosystems, identifies the institutional vacuum and suggests priority area where immediate attention is required in order to formulate better conservation strategies for these productive systems.New hydrological insights for the regionIt has been found that management of wetlands has received inadequate attention in the national water sector agenda. As a result, many of the wetlands are subject to anthropogenic pressures, including land use changes in the catchment; pollution from industry and households; encroachments; tourism; and over exploitation of their natural resources. Further, majority of research on wetland management in India relates to the limnological aspects and ecological/environmental economics of wetland management. But, the physical (such as hydrological and land use changes in the catchment) and socio-economic processes leading to limnological changes have not been explored substantially.ObjectiveTo examine the phyto-constituents of Adiantum caudataum (A. caudataum), Adiantum latifolium (A. latifolium), Adiantum lunulatum (A. lunulatum), Christella dentata (C. dentate) and Christella parasitica (C. parasitica), to provide chemical marker and find inter- specific variation between the medicinally important genuses.MethodsThe dried and powered leaves materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 250 mL of petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, methanol, chloroform, acetone, benzene and water by using Soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. The aqueous extracts were filtered using Whattman filter paper (No.1) and then concentrated in vacuum at 40 °C using Rotary evaporator. The residues obtained were stored in a freezer −70 °C until further tests. Phytochemical screening of the extracts was carried out according to the standard methods.ResultsA total of five plants and 30 extracts were examined for the phytochemical screening. The crude extracts of A. caudataum, A. latifolium, A. lunulatum, C. dentata and C. parasitica showed varied degree of phyto-constituents with reference to solvents of the plant extracts. A total of three plants and 18 extracts were examined for the phytochemical screening A. caudataum, A. latifolium, A. lunulatum. The steroid is totally absent in the tested extracts of A. lunulatum. Similar to that caoboxylic acid also absent in A. caudatum and Coumarin showed its presence only in A. caudatum. A total of two plants and twelve extracts were examined for the phytochemical properties of Christella. Of which phenol is present in 11 extracts tested. Steroid is present only in one extract of C. parasitica and coumarin is present only in C. parasitica five extracts.ConclusionsThe present study result provids a simple and cheap tool (Chemical marker) for the characterization and identification of the medicinally important taxa. With the help the phytochemical screenings we can find inter- specific variation between the medicinally important genuses and easily we can differentiate the Adiantum and Christella genuses.ObjectiveTo examine the secondary metabolites present in the leaf extracts of Rhododendron arboreum Sm. ssp. nilagiricum (Zenker) Tagg.MethodsPhytochemical screening of the leaf extract was done to determine the phytochemical constituents in the various solvents studied.ResultsThe phytochemical study carried out on the leaf extracts of R. arboreum Sm. ssp. nilagiricum (Zenker) Tagg. confirm the existence of secondary metabolites such as phenols, saponins and tannins.ConclusionsThe study suggests that the leaf extracts of R. arboreum Sm. ssp. nilagiricum (Zenker) Tagg. can be best utilized in developing bioactive compounds against pathogenic infection.Here we test an application, based on the analysis of the metadata of geotagged photographs, to investigate the provision of recreational services by the network of wetland ecosystems in the state of Kerala, India. We estimate visitation to individual wetlands state-wide and extend, for the first time to a developing region, the emerging application of recreational ecosystem services (ES) modelling using data from social media and environmental quality data. The impacts of restoration of wetland areal extension and water quality improvement are explored as a means to inform sustainable management strategies. Findings show that improving water quality to a level suitable for the preservation of wildlife and fisheries could increase annual recreational visits by 13% (350,000) to wetlands state-wide. Results support the notion that passive crowdsourced data from social media has the potential to improve current ecosystem service analyses and environmental management practices also in the context of developing countries.Plasmodium vivax malaria is a globally widespread disease responsible for 50% of human malaria cases in Central and South America, South East Asia and Indian subcontinent. The rising severity of the disease and emerging resistance of the parasite has emphasized the need for the search of novel therapeutic targets to combat P. vivax malaria. Plasmepsin 4 (PM4) a food vacuole aspartic protease is essential in parasite functions and viability such as initiating hemoglobin digestion and processing of proteins and is being looked upon as potential drug target. Although the plasmepsins of Plasmodium falciparum have been extensively studied, the plasmepsins of P. vivax are not well characterized. This is the first report detailing complete PM4 gene analysis from Indian P. vivax isolates. Blast results of sequences of P. vivax plasmepsin 4 (PvPM4) shows 100% homology among isolates of P. vivax collected from different geographical regions of India. All of the seven Indian isolates did not contain intron within the coding region. Interestingly, PvPM4 sequence analysis showed a very high degree of homology with all other sequences of Plasmodium species available in the genebank. Our results strongly suggest that PvPM4 are highly conserved except a small number of amino acid substitutions that did not modify key motifs at active site formation for the function or the structure of the enzymes. Furthermore, our study shows that PvPM4 occupies unique phylogenetic status within Plasmodium group and sufficiently differ from the most closely related human aspartic protease, cathepsin D. The analysis of 3D model of PM4 showed a typical aspartic protease structure with bi-lobed, compact and distinct peptide binding cleft in both P. vivax and P. falciparum. In order to validate appropriate use of PM4 as potential anti-malarial drug target, studies on genetic and structural variations among P. vivax plasmepsins (PvPMs) from different geographical regions are of utmost importance for drugs and vaccine designs for anti-malarial strategies.Red ferruginous (RF) soils of tropical Indian environments belong to Entisols, Inceptisols, Alfisols, Mollisols and Ultisols soil orders. The occurrence of Ultisols alongside acidic Alfisols and Mollisols in both zeolitic and non-zeolitic parent materials in humid tropical (HT) climatic environments, indicates that the soil diversity in India is large. These soils are not confined to a single production system and generally maintain a positive organic carbon (OC) balance without adding significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. This review presents a synthesis of literature on the recent developments on the pedology of RF soils, including their physical, chemical, biological, mineralogical and micro-morphological properties, and their degradation status. It also addresses the changes in soil properties in semi-arid tropical (SAT) areas, created by climate shift during the Holocene. This knowledge contributed to our understanding as to how the parent material composition influences the formation of Alfisols, Mollisols and Ultisols in weathering environments of HT climate; and also as to how the relict Alfisols of SAT areas are polygenetic. The state-of-the-art information developed through the extensive work on such soils has helped establish an organic link between pedogenetic processes and bulk soil properties, and has provided an insight of many pedological and edaphological issues related to Alfisols, Mollisols and Ultisols mainly of HT climate. The synthesis has helped us to understand as to why the formation of Oxisols from Ultisols is an improbable genetic pathway in tropical environment of India and elsewhere in the world. There is a strong need to modify the mineralogy class of highly weathered RF soils. We hope this review will help to dispel some of the myths on the formation of tropical soils and their low fertility by putting in context their characteristics and capacity to be productive.Invasive species are capable of causing considerable damage to natural ecosystems, agriculture and economies throughout the World. Samsum ant, Brachyponera (Pachycondyla) sennaarensis has been a reason for medical implication and social nuisance through its poisonous and severely painful sting causing anaphylactic shock in many cases. We surveyed for the presence of the samsum ant in various provinces of Saudi Arabia. B. sennaarensis was the abundant Ponerinae species in human settlements. In the Eastern provinces, however, few samples were collected, and none were found in the Northern and Western provinces. Infestations of B. sennaarensis were particularly severe in the spring and summer seasons, when the ants make nests in moist areas and in cracks in cemented structures, whereas the extent of infestation reduced in winter seasons.ObjectiveTo develop an efficient protocol for in vitro multiplication of the ethnomedicinal shrub Acacia caesia (A. caesia) L. Willd.,MethodsLeaf explants were inoculated on MS medium supplemented with TDZ and NAA for callus induction. Subculturing experiments were conducted by using leaf derived calli for shoot proliferation on MS medium fortified with various growth regulators like IBA, TDZ, BAP and GA3. The regenerated shoots were rooted in half strength MS medium supplemented with various concentrations of IBA, IAA and Kn. After roots were developed, the plantlets were transplanted to pots filled with garden soil, sand and vermicompost and kept in growth chamber with 70%–80% humidity under16h photoperiod. After acclimatization, the plantlets were transferred to the garden and survival percentage was calculated. Data were statistically analyzed and means were compared using Duncan\\'s Multiple Range Test (P <0.05).ResultsAn in vitro multiplication protocol was developed for the locally demanded medicinal plant species, A. caesia by using leaf explant. The study revealed that the callus formation was effective in MS medium containing TDZ and NAA at 1.5 and 0.3 mg/L respectively. Shoot induction was most successful in MS medium supplemented with combination of the auxin, IBA and cytokinin, TDZ at 2.0 and 0.5 mg/L respectively. A single leaf explant was capable of producing 12 shoots/callus after 30 days of culture. The other supplementation in MS medium with IBA and Kn at 2.0 and 0.4 mg/L respectively produced higher rooting frequency, roots/shoot and root length. The survivability rate of leaf callus derived plantlets was significantly higher (84%) in the hardening medium composed by garden soil, sand and vermicompost (1:1:1) by volume.ConclusionsA significant progress has been made in the in vitro regeneration system of this medicinally important plant species, A. caesia.Herbicide-resistant (HR) rice has the potential to improve the efficiency of weed management and facilitate adoption of resource conservation technologies (RCTs) in India. However, several important risks associated with HR rice should be examined before its widespread adoption is encouraged. The greatest risk in the commercialization of HR crops is the potential for transfer of the gene conferring the HR trait to related wild and weedy relatives. This could lead to increased weediness or invasiveness. Gene transfer between cultivated and wild or weedy rice is known to occur and existing scientific literature confirms that HR genes can move from HR rice to wild and weedy relatives forming hybrids. The likelihood of such gene transfer is especially high in India, where cultivated rice and its relatives are sympatrically distributed and their flowering times overlap. Such gene flow can impact crop invasiveness, fitness of wild species, and the loss of native biodiversity. Additionally, HR rice may contribute to the problems of crop volunteers and evolution of herbicide resistance. Based on existing scientific literature, it appears that these risks are low, but that additional studies are needed to fully assess the potential adverse consequences of widespread adoption of HR rice in India.This paper focuses on lessons learnt from Cleaner Production (CP) experiences in textile bleaching and dyeing (hosiery) clusters in India. The regional and industry contexts for CP are demonstrated by outlining the interaction and interdependency between the urban and rural environment, and an industry cluster centered on Tirupur City. A policy for fostering water use productivity in the industry cluster is discussed, which shows how that in order for resource productivity to be maintained, regional and industry CP strategies should be aligned. This is illustrated by a discussion on CP lessons in water and chemicals conservation. The paper also recommends future areas of CP investigations required in the industry to make it ecologically sustainable in the long-term.Change in Land Cover and Land Use (LCLU) influences the runoff characteristics of a drainage basin to a large extent, which in turn, affects the surface and groundwater availability of the area, and hence leads to further change in LCLU. This forms a vicious circle. Hence it becomes essential to assess the effect of change in LCLU on the runoff characteristics of a region in general and of small watershed levels (sub-basin levels) in particular. Such an analysis can effectively be carried out by using watershed simulation models with integrated GIS frame work. SWAT (Soil and Water Analysis Tool) model, being one of the versatile watershed simulation models, is found to be suitable for this purpose as many GIS integration modules are available for this model (e.g. ArcSWAT, MWSWAT). Watershed simulation using SWAT requires the land use and land cover data, soil data and many other features. With the availability of repository of satellite imageries, both from Indian and foreign sources, it becomes possible to use the concurrent local land use and land cover data, thereby enabling more accurate modelling of small watersheds. Such availability will also enable us to assess the effect of LCLU on runoff characteristics and their reverse impact. The current study assesses the effect of land use and land cover on the runoff characteristics of two watersheds in Kerala, India. It also assesses how the change in land use and land cover in the last few decades affected the runoff characteristics of these watersheds. It is seen that the reduction in the forest area amounts to 60% and 32% in the analysed watersheds. However, the changes in the surface runoff for these watersheds are not comparable with the changes in the forest area but are within 20%. Similarly the maximum (peak) value of runoff has increased by an amount of 15% only. The lesser (aforementioned) effect than expected might be due to the fact that forest has been converted to agricultural purpose with major portion as plantations which have comparatively similar characteristics of the forest except for evapo-transpiration. The double sided action (increase in evapo-transpiration owing to species like rubber and increase percolation due to its plantation method by using terracing) might be the reason for relatively smaller effect of the land use change, not commensurate with the changes in the forest area amounting to 60% and 32% for Manali and Kurumali watersheds respectively. Water harvesting methods like rain harvesting ditches can be made mandatory where species with high evapo-transpiration are grown. This action shall enhance the groundwater percolation and shall counter act the effect due to high evapo-transpiration.The Mughal settlements are an integral part of Old Dhaka. Uncontrolled urbanization, changes in land use patterns, the growing density of new settlements, and modern transportation have brought about rapid transformation to the historic fabric of the Mughal settlements. As a result, Mughal structures are gradually turning into isolated elements in the transforming fabric. This study aims to promote the historic quality of the old city through clear and sustainable integration of the Mughal settlements in the existing fabric. This study attempts to analyze the Mughal settlements in old Dhaka and correspondingly outline strategic approaches to protect Mughal artifacts from decay and ensure proper access and visual exposure in the present urban tissue.ObjectiveTo study the phytochemical class and its antioxidant activity of various extractions of Strychnos minor (S. minor), a rare endemic medicinal plant of South India.MethodsLeaves of S. minor were collected from Agasthiyar Malai hills of South India and shade dried. Different solvent extractions were made for the preliminary screening of phytochemicals and their total flavonoids and polyphenols levels were quantified using standard procedures. Finally, the extracts were studied for their antioxidant potential by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and chelating effects on ferrous ions.ResultsPhytochemical screening of the plant shows the presence of various biochemicals like alkaloid, tannins, terpenoids, saponins, flavonoids and resins and absence of phlobatannins. Flavanoids were high with water extracts (6.14 mg/g) and showed high 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity (77.25%) whereas total polyphenols was high with methanol extraction (12.12 mg/g). Ethylacetae extract showed poor flavanoid and polyphenol content which reflected their low antioxidant potential when compared to other extracts.ConclusionsThe present study confirms the presence of various phytochemicals which shows good antioxidant potential of S. minor. This work will be helpful to explore the biochemical profile and active compound identification in the field of pharmaceutical research.Much of India contains complex and ambiguous post-colonial environmental histories. Within the international clean cookstove development discourse, it is assumed that fuelwood collection for cooking is a significant factor in the overexploitation of forest biomass. This brand of storytelling is certainly applied in India where a series of programs have long targeted household fuelwood collection activities as a way of reversing rates of deforestation. This essay outlines the enigmatic and peculiar environmental histories of two distinct regions in South India. Based on oral histories, interviews and field surveys our findings indicate that many pressures other than fuel collection have helped alter vegetation and reduce fuel availability, particularly the expansion of commercially cultivated land in recent years. Moreover, a variety of historical contingencies, such as mass displacement from dam construction and the deliberate seeding of an invasive species complicate one-dimensional or reductive explanations of landscape change — a discursive environmental rendering referred to here as a ‘disingenuous nature’. Through retrospective analysis, we describe how this land use narrative, like so many other sustainable development discourses premised on incomplete and misleading information, is the byproduct of a ‘multi-scale narrative repurposing and sector coalescence’ process. This characterization signals how environmental narratives are repurposed and recycled uncritically by actors in distinct yet discursively compatible development sectors.The sustainable livelihood approach is an analytical framework that helps identifying the assets that local communities rely on, the risks they are subjected to, organisations and institutions influence their daily lives and the strategies they undertake. This is a valuable approach in small-scale fisheries management as artisanal fisheries are exposed to uncertainty in terms of supply and demand, and fishing activities usually are influenced by social and institutional factors. However, in spite of its usefulness and the fact that this approach has been previously used in projects targeting small-scale fisher communities, it is still not widely applied to small-scale fisheries. In this study we applied the sustainable livelihood approach as an analytical tool to assess the potential of the mud crab Scylla serrata as a sustainable livelihood resource for the southwest Indian states such as Karnataka. As fishers worldwide face continuous pressure from industrial fishing fleets and decreased fish stocks and their productivity, we also identified what could be the potential barriers to small-scale mud crab farming for communities that are already are involved in mud crab fishing. Data were collected and analysed from a semi-structured questionnaire, two focus group discussions and key informant interviews conducted in Uttara Kannada district, Karnataka. The results indicated that though mud crab is perceived as a good source of income in this area, at present it is not recognised as a steady source of income due to the unpredictable fishery catches. Respondents were aware of mud crab farming yet stated the lack of land and financial resources as the main barriers and only the minority expressed any interest in undertaking such activity. The sustainable livelihood approach proved to be a valuable research tool for identifying matters of concern for local communities regarding their source of livelihoods and barriers to small-scale aquaculture.The importance of genetic variation for maintaining biological diversity and evolutionary processes is widely accepted; however, limited action has been taken to protect genetic diversity in natural populations. Until recently, it was assumed that the exploitation of non-timber forest products, such as fruits, barks and exudates, had low environmental impact, but recognition that the harvesting of these plants can affect several biological levels, including genetic diversity and structure, has been growing. Nevertheless, the effect of harvesting non-timber forest products on the genetic diversity of the harvested species is poorly understood. The objective of this work is to assess the impact of harvesting on the genetic diversity of Himatanthus drasticus (Apocynaceae), a tree of the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) that is highly exploited for its medicinal latex. We tested the hypothesis that harvesting can cause a trade-off between survival and reproduction in H. drasticus, reducing the effective population size as well as the genetic diversity in highly exploited populations. The study was conducted in the Araripe National Forest, a preserved Cerrado area in Ceará State, Brazil. We sampled six populations that included two different levels of harvesting (high-harvest and low-harvest) and characterized the genetic diversity and structure in two groups (adults and seedlings) using microsatellite markers. We verified high levels of polymorphism in H. drasticus; however, significant levels of inbreeding in all studied populations were also observed. We found a higher degree of genetic structure in the seedling group when compared with the adult group, a difference that was most likely due to seed rain deposited in nearby locations. No differences were detected in adult genetic diversity levels between populations under different harvesting intensities. However, seedling allelic richness was significantly lower in the high-harvested populations, indicating allelic losses that may be associated with the exploitation of bark and latex. Evidence of genetic loss due to overharvesting was supported by significant bottleneck signatures observed in the seedling group of two out of three high-harvest populations. The establishment of a conservation strategy is imperative to avoid future genetic losses and ensure the long-term viability of H. drasticus populations. The information obtained in this study has been integrated with ecological information about the effects of latex tapping on phenology, demography and biomass recovery of exploited populations, with the goal of proposing a sustainable management plan for the species.One-fifth of the world\\'s reptiles are currently estimated as threatened with extinction, primarily due to the immediate threats of habitat loss and overexploitation. Climate change presents an emerging slow-acting threat. However, few IUCN Red List assessments for reptiles explicitly consider the potential role of climate change as a threat. Thus, climate change vulnerability assessments can complement existing Red List assessments and highlight further, emerging priorities for conservation action.Here we present the first trait-based global climate change vulnerability assessment for reptiles to estimate the climate change vulnerability of a random representative sample of 1498 species of reptiles. We collected species-specific traits relating to three dimensions of climate change, sensitivity, low adaptability, and exposure, which we combined to assess overall vulnerability.We found 80.5% of species highly sensitive to climate change, primarily due to habitat specialisation, while 48% had low adaptability and 58% had high exposure. Overall, 22% of species assessed were highly vulnerable to climate change. Hotspots of climate change vulnerability did not always overlap with hotspots of threatened species richness, with most of the vulnerable species found in northwestern South America, southwestern USA, Sri Lanka, the Himalayan Arc, Central Asia and southern India. Most families were found to be significantly more vulnerable to climate change than expected by chance.Our findings build on previous work on reptile extinction risk to provide an overview of the risk posed to reptiles by climate change. Despite significant data gaps for a number of traits, we recommend that these findings are integrated into reassessments of species\\' extinction risk, to monitor both immediate and slow-acting threats to reptiles.The high elevational areas in the Himalayas of India are dominated by forests and alpine pastures. There are many protected areas in the region, including Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) and Valley of Flowers (VOF) where natural resource management plan (NRMP) has been implemented for the conservation of biodiversity. This has affected the traditional animal husbandry system, as well as the vegetation dynamics of alpine pastures. An integrated approach to studying the impact of NRMP in the region has been applied by us. First, a survey was conducted regarding livestock management, data pertaining the livestock husbandry, the role of animal husbandry in economics of rural household, and socioeconomics. Second, field based study on phytosociology of some important alpine herbs was done to enumerate the density and species richness in different land mark of the region. Thereafter, satellite data and Geographic Information System (GIS) were used to develop a land cover map of the area and to note changes in the landscape over time after implementation of NRMP. From an economic point of view the implementation of such plan is a setback to the rural economy. However, the ecological perspective of such models is a threat to the diversity of alpine pastures. The invasion of bushes/thorny bushes/shrubs and weeds with their luxuriant growth is changing the vegetation index and dynamics. Consequently, the diversity of herbs in alpine pastures of the Himalayan Mountains is in jeopardy. Overall, the situation is leading to landscape change in the region. This study is helpful for generating useful outcomes and strategies considering the question or debate “is grazing good or bad for pasture ecosystems in the Himalayas?”.ObjectiveTo develop an improved protocol for micropropagation of ethnomedicinally important Scoparia dulcis (S. dulcis) L.MethodsExplants were inoculated on MS basal medium supplemented with kinetin and 6-benzylaminopurine for shoot bud induction. To enhance the shoot induction, various auxins like 3-indoleacetic acid or 3-indolebutyric acid or α-naphthylacetic acid were tested along with 2.32 M KI and 4.44 μM BAP. The regenerated shoots were rooted in half strength MS medium supplemented with various concentrations of IAA, IBA or NAA. After roots were developed, the plantlets were transplanted to pots filled with vermiculate and sand and kept in growth chamber with 70%–80% humidity under 16 h photoperiod. After acclimatization, the plantlets were transferred to the garden and survival percentage was calculated. Data were statistically analyzed and means were compared using Duncan\\'s multiple range test (P < 0.05).ResultsAn in vitro method was developed to induce high frequency shoots regeneration from stem, mature leaf and young leaf explants of S. dulcis. Shoot induction on young leaf explants was most successful in MS medium supplemented with combination of two cytokinins (2.32 μM KI and 4.44 μM BAP) 2.85 μM IAA, 10% CM and 1 483.79 μM adenine sulfate. A single young leaf explant was capable of producing 59 shoots after 13 days of culture. Flower was induced in medium supplemented with combination of KI and BAP.ConclusionsCytokinins are the key factor to induce the direct shoot regeneration and flowering of S. dulcis.Ethnopharmacological relevanceThis study provides significant ethnopharmacological information, both qualitative and quantitative on medicinal plants in the Thoppampatti village, Dindigul district, Tamilnadu, India. There is urgency in recording such data to conserve the traditional medicinal plants. This is the first ethnobotanical study which records the traditional important medicinal plants of Thoppampatti village. To collect, analyze and evaluate the ethnopharmacologic knowledge in Thoppampatti village in order to protect it. This study reports the results of an ethnopharmacological survey on the uses of medicinal plants by inhabitants of the Thoppampatti.Materials and methodsThe field study was carried out in a period of about one year (April 2012–May 2013) in Thoppampatti village. The information was obtained through open and semi-structured interviews with 48 (27 males, 21 females) knowledgeable local people and traditional healers (THs). The collected data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, use value (UV), relative importance (RI) and Jaccard index (JI) was determined.ResultsA total of 139 species of plants, mostly trees and herbs, belonging to 54 families were identified in this study. This is used to treat 142 diseases and ailments. These ailments were categorized into 18 major categories. Leaves were the most frequently used parts, while decoction and juice are the most common method of preparation to treat various diseases. Based on IUCN Red data the identified medicinal plants include 11 least concerned species, 3 vulnerable species and one endangered species. The most important species according to their use value were Cynodon dactylon (0.79), Azadirachta indica (0.73), Ocimum tenuiflorum (0.71), Moringa oleifera (0.68), Coriandrum sativum (0.62), Abelmoschus esculentus (0.61), Acalypha indica (0.59) and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis (0.59).ConclusionAs a result of the present study, medicinal plants play an important role in the health care of Thoppampatti village inhabitants; they rely on medicinal plants to treat various ailments. In addition, the medicinal plants with high RI values might give some useful leads for further pharmacological investigations. Deforestation and overexploitation of a particular plant species leads to extinction so sustainable utilization of medicinal plants is recommended in the study area.Biodiversity is the feedstock for the biotechnology industry. Hence, the conservation, enhancement and sustainable and equitable use of biodiversity should be accorded high priority in all national environment protection programmes. Lichens serve as useful indicators of environmental health. Similarly, several blue green algae help to sequester salt from water. There is need for the more widespread use of such biomonitoring and bioremediation agents. Bioprospecting research designed to identify novel metabolites must be rooted in the principle of equity in sharing benefits with the holders of traditional knowledge. There is need for greater vigil against alien invasive species, since with growing world trade in food grains and other agricultural commodities, there is an increasing possibility of introducing new pests, weeds and harmful micro-organisms. Finally, biological scientists should place emphasis on their ethical responsibility for the consequences of their research, since otherwise bioterrorism could become a major threat to human security.Known as the “king of spices”, black pepper (Piper nigrum), a perennial crop of the tropics, is economically the most important and the most widely used spice crop in the world. To understand its suitable bioclimatic distribution, maximum entropy based on ecological niche modeling was used to model the bioclimatic niches of the species in its Asian range. Based on known occurrences, bioclimatic areas with higher probabilities are mainly located in the eastern and western coasts of the Indian Peninsula, the east of Sumatra Island, some areas in the Malay Archipelago, and the southeast coastal areas of China. Some undocumented places were also predicted as suitable areas. According to the jackknife procedure, the minimum temperature of the coldest month, the mean monthly temperature range, and the precipitation of the wettest month were identified as highly effective factors in the distribution of black pepper and could possibly account for the crop\\'s distribution pattern. Such climatic requirements inhibited this species from dispersing and gaining a larger geographical range.Emissions from deforestation are significant and account for more than 18% of global annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. With the Bali Action Plan categorically placing reduced emissions from degradation and deforestation (REDD) activities on the agenda of future climate change negotiations, there is now a strong possibility that policy approaches and incentives relating to enhancement of carbon stocks in low biomass forests will be successfully negotiated and accepted as a legitimate greenhouse gas mitigation option in the upcoming post-2012 climate change regime. Using the institutional mechanisms provided by community-based forest management (CBFM), 833.8\\xa0Tg carbon can be sequestered by enhancement of forest carbon stocks in low biomass Indian forests. By protection refugia, restoring biodiversity, providing connectivity, mimicking nature in plantations and controlling man-made fires, CBFM as practiced in India can be an effective way of managing forests during times of climate change. Appropriately designed CBFM policy can provide means to sustain and strengthen community livelihoods and at the same time avoid deforestation, restore forest cover and density, provide carbon mitigation and create rural assets. Channeling carbon investment funds into CBFM projects can make both development and conservation economically viable and attractive for the local communities to maintain biodiversity and integrity of nature. However, before actual funding under the Clean Development Mechanism and other international C investment funds is available, policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to REDD need to be negotiated and agreed upon by the participating nations to UNFCCC.Determining economically viable and highly efficient strategic locations for utility-scale solar power plants is a costly procedure that depends on several factors. This paper investigates the spatial suitability for installations of ground-mounted solar farms based on legal, social, technical, economic, environmental and cultural perspectives through the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis combined with Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique. A set of six exclusion criteria are identified and removed from the map layer considered exploitable for construction. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is then used to determine the weights of nine selected evaluation criteria found to influence the placements of the farms. Proximity raster layers were derived from features including road network and high transmission lines, overlain with a 10\\u202fm\\u202f×\\u202f10\\u202fm raster terrain layers which includes elevation, slope and aspect and finally combined with interpolated raster dataset of climatological parameters comprising of global solar radiation, sunshine duration, air temperature and relative humidity. This combinatorial process through the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) technique generated a high resolution solar resource potential atlas classifying regions on the island from high to low potential for solar farm placement. Further analysis of highly suitable sites with aerial images of the localities of interest resulted in the identification of 3 best sites all situated in the northern plains of the island. The approach demonstrated is expected to help reduce time, money and resources presently allocated towards identifying and assessing hot spots for the construction of solar power plants in Mauritius.Anthropogenic fires have strong impacts in tropical rainforests that are not necessarily restricted to the burnt areas, as edge influence from the burnt patch may significantly alter the unburnt vegetation. Conversely, the remaining forest patches may mitigate changes in microclimate in the adjacent burnt areas. We studied variation in air and soil temperature in burnt and unburnt areas in the Atlantic forest of southern Bahia, Brazil. In November-December 2017, approx. two years after a series of wildfires, we sampled six transects at three burnt-unburnt edges, placing soil and temperature data loggers at the edge and at 20, 60, and 120\\u202fm into the burnt and unburnt areas and keeping them there for seven days. One data logger of each pair was buried at a depth of 3\\u202fcm and the other was kept at a height of 1\\u202fm above ground in a protective case. Air in the burnt area was cooler than in the forest at night and warmer in the morning, whereas soil was cooler than in the forest at night and early morning and warmer in the afternoon. We did not observe gradients in air or soil temperature, but soil temperature was more variable in the burnt area than in the unburnt forest. Conversely, notwithstanding the differences between diurnal and noctural temperatures, daily average, minimum and maximum air temperature varied little between the environments, possibly due to shading by bracken fern in the burnt areas. The variation in soil temperature is likely due to changes in vegetation structure, as the bracken fern does not provide as much shade and temperature control as the native forest canopy. Thus, even in the absence of strong effects on air temperature, changes in the temporal and spatial variability of soil temperature may be observed, with possible consequences for plant recruitment and soil organisms.Watershed prioritization has gained importance in natural resources management, especially in the context of watershed management. Delineation of watersheds within a large drainage basin and their prioritization is required for proper planning and management of natural resources for sustainable development. Delineation of potential zones for implementation of conservation measures above the entire watershed at similar occurrence is inaccessible as well as uneconomical; therefore it is a prerequisite to apply viable technique for prioritization of sub watersheds (SW). The present research attempted to study various morphological characteristics and to implement Geographical Information System (GIS) and Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) through Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) techniques for identification of critical sub watersheds situated in transaction zone between mountainous and water scarcity region of kallar watershed, Tamil Nadu. The morphometric characterization was obtained through the measurement of three distinct linear, areal and relief aspects over the eleven sub-watersheds. The morphometric characterization showed vital role in distinguishing the topographical and hydrological behavior of the watershed. Each morphometric parameters were ranked with respect to the value and weightings obtained by deriving the relationships between the morphometric parameters obtained through classification of the SW by associating the strength of Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Processes (FAHP). Based on FAHP approach, sub watersheds were evaluated and divided into five prioritization zones: very less, less, medium, high and very high classes. The FAHP techniques is a practical approach for identification of the sensitive priority zones and is useful for better management practices such as implementation of land and water resource management, conservation and sustainable agricultural development.ObjectiveTo conduct an ethnobotanical survey and collect information about the medicinal plants used in the treatments of various ailments by the Nadars of Atoor village of Kanyakumari district, Tamilnadu, India.MethodsInformation presented in this document was gathered from the Nadars using an integrated approach of botanical collections, discussions with the elderly people, traditional medicinal practitioners (locally known as Vaidhyars) and local faith healer and interviews with questionnaires in the years 2009-2010.ResultsA total of 89 plant species representing 47 families have been reported to be in use among the Nadars of the study area. Family wise distribution of medicinal plants shows Acanthaceae, Asclepiadaceae and Lamiaceae was the most speciose family with 5 genus and 5 species each and Liliaceae was the co-dominant family represented by 3 genus and 4 species. Of the 89 plants species, 14 were tree species, 18 shrubs, 47 herbs and 10 climbers.ConclusionThe study revealed that Nadars have a great faith in the traditional healing system and they rely on medicinal plants for treatment of various illnesses. Further studies on phytochemistry, pharmacology and pharmacognosy on these species may lead to the invention of novel bioactive compounds to treat pathogenic diseases.Large investments are being made in the establishment of tree plantations on degraded land in Asia. These initiatives are often politically driven and aspire to achieve both economic and environmental benefits. However, the lack of clarity about the precise objectives of these schemes means that they often fail to yield either local economic or global environmental benefits. There is often a failure to negotiate with all concerned stakeholders and to recognize and resolve trade-offs. Subsidies have often had perverse impacts, and market forces may be better drivers of economic objectives of restoration programmes. Security of tenure and use rights is an important but often neglected requirement for achieving sustainability. Remnant patches of natural vegetation, even when degraded, are often valuable sources of local biodiversity in restoration schemes. The spatial patterns of different types of forest and of non-forest land are important determinants of environmental values. Biodiversity conservation requires maintaining or re-establishing habitat strips to connect natural forest blocks and protect ecological gradients. However, even monoculture plantations often have significant biodiversity value. The fundamental principles of ecosystem approaches as adopted by the Convention for the Conservation of Biological Diversity and principles for successful common property resource management provide valuable frameworks for forest restoration schemes.Despite the availability of a wide range of tools, measuring and explaining changes in land cover and land use in tropical regions can be extremely challenging. Kerala, India, is a biodiversity hotspot with a high population density and a long history of complex agricultural land-use patterns. Some reports suggest that agriculture in Kerala, which historically is rice paddy-wetland and agroforestry-based, is on the decline. However, the evidence is often anecdotal, especially with regards to smallholding homegarden agriculture. In this study we employ mixed methods, including remote sensing, quantitative household surveys, and semi-structured interviews, to unravel the complex land-cover and land-use changes occurring in Kerala.Results indicate that, from a land-cover change perspective, agroforests are in dynamic equilibrium with other land covers, being cleared for roads and new buildings, but offset by the expansion of younger, less diverse agroforests into paddy wetlands. Yet beneath the canopy, agroforests are undergoing rapid land-use change not discernible using remote sensing. These changes include a reported decrease in the cultivation of 80% of Kerala’s primary crop species during 2003–2013, alongside a dramatic decline in chickens (from 12.5 to 2.6 per homestead on average) and cows (from 1.7 to 0.8). Over this period, no crop increased in cultivation. According to farmers, the primary drivers of this shift were declining profitability of agriculture in Kerala, labour shortages, unreliable weather, unfamiliar pests and diseases, and government policy.Despite the undeniable move away from agricultural activity in homegardens, we conclude that these ecologically and culturally important systems are not disappearing, but rather evolving to meet the needs of a less agricultural Kerala. Our research highlights the value of using mixed methods for characterizing land-use and land-cover histories in tropical regions.Highly efficient in vitro regeneration system has been developed for Swertia lawii Burkill, an important herb used as substitute for Swertia chirayita. Shoot tips explants were cultured on MS medium with various phytohormones for multiple shoot production. The best shoot production frequency (100%) and maximum shoots (10.4\\xa0±\\xa00.8) were obtained on MS media containing TDZ (3.0\\xa0mg\\xa0l−1) in combination with IBA (0.3\\xa0mg\\xa0l−1). Maximum callus induction (95\\xa0±\\xa04.8%) and callus growth (1.7\\xa0±\\xa00.4\\xa0gm) was achieved on MS medium with 2, 4-D (3.0\\xa0mg\\xa0l−1). Cell suspension cultures were established and studied for their growth kinetics. Shoots were rooted best (22.1\\xa0±\\xa02.5) in 1/2 MS medium with IAA (3.0\\xa0mg\\xa0l−1). The genetic uniformity of the micropropagated clones was assessed using RAPD markers. Out of 405 bands, 400 (98.76%) were monomorphic and rest 5 (1.24%) were polymorphic. High multiplication frequency and low risk of genetic instability ensures the efficacy of this protocol.Synergism between extrinsic and intrinsic factors is crucial for the seasonality of reproduction. Environmental factors such as photoperiod and temperature activate the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis leading to the secretion of steroid hormones that are crucial for reproduction. Sex steroids are not only essential for the maturation of gonads, but also for development of secondary sexual characters in males and reproductive behaviour of both the sexes. In the present study, we quantified the urinary testosterone (UTM) and corticosterone (UCM) metabolites in males and urinary estradiol metabolites (UEM) and UCM in females of Nyctibatrachus humayuni for two consecutive years to determine annual and seasonal variation in the levels of sex steroids, corticosterone and body condition index (BCI). The results show that sex steroids were highest during the breeding season and lowest during the non-breeding season in both the sexes. An increase in UTM and UEM was observed in males and females respectively during the breeding season. Testicular histology showed the presence of all stages of spermatogenesis throughout the year indicating that spermatogenesis is potentially continuous. Ovarian histology showed the presence of vitellogenic follicles only during the breeding season indicating that oogenesis is strictly seasonal. In males, UCM levels were highest during the breeding season, while in females their levels were highest just prior to the breeding season. In males, BCI was highest during the pre-breeding season, declined during the breeding season to increase again during the post-breeding season. In females, BCI was comparable throughout the year. In males, UTM levels were positively correlated with UCM levels but negatively correlated with BCI. Interestingly, UEM, UCM and BCI were not correlated in females. These results indicate that N. humayuni exhibits an associated pattern of reproduction. Quantification of urinary progesterone metabolites (UPM) during the breeding season showed UPM levels were higher in post-spawning females, suggesting the significance of progesterone in ovulation. Further, non-invasive enzyme immunoassay has been successfully standardized in N. humayuni for the quantification of urinary metabolites of steroid hormones.Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterial organisms has emerged as one of the major diseases in captive elephants. In vitro Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) assay is being used as an ancillary test for early detection of TB in domestic and captive wild animals. In the present study, basic sequence information and immunological cross-reactivity of this major cytokine of Asian elephants were explored. At predicted amino acid level, IFN-γ of Asian elephant showed maximum identity to that of horse (73%). Other IFN-γ amino acid sequences that showed high level identity were that of giant panda (72%), dog (71%), nine-banded armadillo (69%), cattle (63%) and human (62%). IFN-γ promoter sequences of Asian elephant, human, cattle and mouse showed high level conservation of the putative transcription factor binding sites, TATA box and transcriptional start site. The functionally important human IFN-γ promoter elements, such as AP-2IRE-BE, YY1-γIFN-BED, ATFCS and AP-1γINF binding sites, were absolutely conserved in the corresponding elephant sequence. There was only a single nucleotide variation in the other two important elements, NFAT-γINF and IFN-γPE, indicating the highly conserved regulation of IFN-γ expression across different species. Phylogenetic analysis based on IFN-γ protein sequences revealed a closer relation of Asian elephants and nine-banded armadillo. This shows a closer evolution of these members of Afrotheria and Xenarthra, respectively; and supports the previous reports based on mitochondrial DNA studies. In Western blot analysis, IFN-γ of Asian elephant expressed in Escherichia coli was detected using an anti-bovine IFN-γ monoclonal antibody, indicating immunological cross-reactivity.This paper presents the results of a sustainability analysis carried out for the evaluation of two participatory watershed projects in Kerala, South India. For a watershed project to be sustainable, four groups of criteria should be considered related to natural resources, technology, institutions and economics, respectively. Poor performance in each of these groups can jeopardise sustainability. The process is as strong as the weakest shackle in the chain. For a watershed project to be sustainable, all these groups should perform above a minimum standard. In both projects studied, the weakest shackle in the sustainability chain appears to be the economic sustainability of the projects. If one element fails, sustainability cannot be achieved.Study on the dependence of orchids on fungi for seed germination and seedling development provides a mean for understanding the role of fungi in the orchid development process. The epiphytic orchid Coelogyne nervosa endemic to south India is exploited in an unsustainable manner for its therapeutic value. So a protocol for symbiotic seed germination was established for C. nervosa. We isolated a fungus by plating mycorrhizal root discs of the terrestrial orchid Eulophia epidendreae and identified it as Epulorhiza sp., by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the ribosomal RNA gene. Germination of C. nervosa seeds was higher when inoculated with Epulorhiza sp. Uninoculated seeds of C. nervosa ceased to develop soon after the initiation of germination, and the embryo failed to rupture the seed testa. The isolated fungal hyphae entered the germinating seeds either through the pores in-between the integuments, or through the rhizoids. After the fungal establishment (peloton formation) in embryonic cells, the embryo transformed into a protocorm and after 45 days, 66% of the germinated seeds were transformed into protocorms. Nevertheless, promeristem formation occurred only after fungal association. Sixty-three percent of the protocorms developed their first leaf by 90 days and 62% of these produced a second leaf by 120 days after fungal inoculation. All the seedlings in green leaf stage produced roots and contained fungal pelotons. Our results suggest that the Epulorhiza sp. could be successfully used in the in\\xa0vitro production of C. nervosa for their reintroduction into its natural environment.ObjectiveTo investigate the antibacterial activity and phytochemical properties of Begonia floccifera Bedd. (B. floccifera) methanolic flower extracts against the selected pathogens.Methods20 g of fresh flowers were soaked in 100 mL methanol for 48 h at room temperature. After 48 h, the extracts were filtered using Whatman No. 41 filter paper. The filtrates were collected, made up to known volume and stored in refrigerator at 4 °C. The methanolic extracts were used for phytochemical and antibacterial studies. The preliminary phytochemical screening was performed according to the modified Harborne method. The methanolic flower extracts of B. floccifera Bedd. was tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the disc diffusion method.ResultsThe results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol, tannins, xanthoproteins, steroids, tannins, steroids, phytosterols, triterpenoids, sapogenins, coumarins and carbohydrates presence in the methanolic extracts of B. floccifera. The antibacterial activity has been observed in the methanolic extracts of B. floccifera against the tested bacteria with varied activity. The maximum zone of inhibition was 28 mm for Bacillus cereus, 25 mm for Staphylococcus aureus, 15 mm for Escherichia coli, 13 mm for Proteus mirabilis, 7 mm for Klebsiella pneumonia.ConclusionsThe antimicrobial activity of B. floccifera methanolic flower extracts are comparable and their potential as alternative in the treatment of infectious by these microorganisms.The northern part of West Bengal, India partially falls within the Terai region of Himalaya. This region is distinctive in terms of high forest cover and rich biodiversity, but also features increasing human population, agricultural practices, and subsequent human-wildlife conflict. This study evaluated the impact of anthropogenic and agricultural proliferation on land use and land cover (LULC) transition dynamics of a forest and its surrounding area of this region. Jaldapara National Park along with its neighbouring region represents an ideal example of such ecology and thus was chosen as the study area. Satellite remote sensing was used to overcome accessibility issues in areas of protected forest and model future possible LULC of the area. Results indicated a continuous decrease in dense forest from 1978 to 2016. Modelling predicted a continuation of the same trend through 2050. The total area under forest increased from 1978 to 2001, possibly due to declaration of a part of the forest as a wildlife sanctuary in 1976 and subsequent increase in supervision and surveillance. However, total forest area started to decline from 2001 and future reductions are possible. Cultivated lands increased from 1978 to 2016 and additional future increase is likely due to a commensurate surge in human population in areas adjacent to the forest. In sum, increasing population pressure, agricultural production demands, and high human intervention in forest ecology were identified as possible causes of temporal forest degradation.Lack of knowledge on forest structure, composition, and magnitude of human impact on various components of the ecosystem remain a major limitation for the development of appropriate participatory management programmes for conservation and sustainable utilisation of forests in Nepal. This study provides information on state of the resource base and effects of site characteristics and human activities on density, diversity and regeneration in Sal (Shorea robusta Gaertn.f.) and Mixed Broadleaved (MBL) forests in the central, lower Mid-Hills of Nepal. For trees with diameter ⩾10\\xa0cm the results are based on 72 square (20\\xa0×\\xa020\\xa0m) plots; for shrubs and herbs the material included 144 plots, nested within the 72 larger plots. Apart from vegetation data the material included information on human impacts, such as tree cutting, livestock grazing and lopping. The proportion of trees felled in Sal forest was observed to be up to 41%. The pressure on the vegetation also affected the regeneration of trees, shrubs and herbs. The density and basal area were moderate for all vegetation types, whereas the species diversity was higher than previously observed in other forests of Nepal. Among the species used by the ethnic group living in the study area, the Chepangs, only half (49.7%) were represented within the plots and the regeneration of such species was poor. Effects of altitude, aspect, grazing, crown cover and other factors on basal area and density of different vegetation strata was examined using general linear models. The results indicated significant human impact on the forest vegetation, both with respect to species diversity, density, distribution, and composition. Reduction of the densities of key livelihood species will affect the social and economic welfare of local people. Thus an improvement of forest management is urgent, because the forests need immediate recovery.Recent studies based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission suggested that groundwater has increased in central and southern parts of India. However, surface water, which is an equally important source of water in these semi-arid areas has not been studied yet. In the present study, the study areas were outlined based on trends in GRACE data followed by trend identification in surface water storages and checking the hypothesis of causality. Surface Water Extent (SWE) and Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) derived from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) respectively, are selected as proxies of surface water storage (SWS). Besides SWE and SSM, trend test was performed for GRACE derived terrestrial water storage (TWS) for the study areas named as R1, R2, GOR1 and KOR1. Granger-causality test is used to test the hypothesis that rainfall is a causal factor of the inter-annual variability of SWE, SSM and TWS. Positive trends were observed in TWS for R1, R2 and GOR1 whereas SWE and SSM show increasing trends for all the study regions. Results suggest that rainfall is the granger-causal of all the storage variables for R1 and R2, the regions exhibiting the most significant positive trends in TWS.Catchment resources, generated from multi-source data (remotely-sensed, map- and ground-based systems), were input to a raster-based Geographical Information Systems (GIS) after geometrically co-registered to a standard grid (pixel). The GIS used was the PC-based, indigenously-developed package, called GRAM (Geo-Referenced Area Management). A set of knowledge-based rules, for assessing the soil erosion of this heterogeneous hilly catchment, were formulated from the knowledge of the multi-disciplinary resource-experts and the knowledge of the local catchment resources, in addition to the field observations. This rule-based model, which is hopefully fast and cost-effective and without effect of the individual bias, helped in inferring the erosion intensity units that most likely to occur at any given pixel in the system. Finally, the catchment was grouped into four different erosion intensity units namely very severe, severe, moderate to severe and slight to moderate. The quantitative soil loss (t ha−1 year−1) ranges, estimated by USLE model by a spatial information analysis approach (GIS), were also computed: (a) Very severe (>50): (b) Severe (40–50); (c) Moderate to severe (20–40); and (d) Slight to moderate (<20). An integrated priority delineation survey, for taking up soil/water conservation measures by Sediment Yield Index model, carried out in the catchment grouped the catchment into very high, high, medium and low priority classes. Apparently, the areal extent of high and moderate priority classes occupy about 80% of the catchment, which is closely following the areal extent of severe and moderate to severe erosion intensity unit categories by this rule-based model. The outcome of the results of this study will be immensely useful to monitor the dynamic changes in the catchment environment. The soil erosion information system thus generated, identifies the targeted problem areas for conservation planning and sustainable development of the catchment. Although it is an early airing of results obtained from this rule-based model, the introduction of multi-disciplinary expert\\'s informed opinion may provide an extension to the traditional methods of assessing the soil erosion status/magnitude which should enable and/or evaluate different catchment management scenarios.Aim of studyIndia has great biodiversity of fauna. The use of fauna with medicinal properties is a common practice since pre-hispanic times. In the last decade, there has been an interest in ethnozoological studies in India. Ethnozoological studies are necessary in order to discover new medications for human health. There is urgency in recording such data. This is the first ethnozoological study in which statistical calculations about animals are done by the ICF method in Kerala, India. The purpose of this study is to analyze and record traditional knowledge of animals utilized by the indigenous people living on Silent Valley, located in Palakkad district of Kerala, India and to document the traditional names, preparation and uses of these animals.Materials and methodsField study was carried out for a period of September 2011 to August 2012 years in Kerala. The ethnomedicinal information was collected through interviews, informal meetings, open and group discussions and overt observations with semi-structured questionnaires among traditional healers. The collected data were analyzed through informant consensus factor (ICF) and fidelity level (FL).ResultsThis study recorded a total of 57 families, 66 genera, and 69 species of animals that produced 163 methods for usages. Mammalian occupied 29% of the total animals listed, followed by aves (28%), insects (17%), reptiles (10%), actinopterygii (4%), malacostraca, amphibians and clitellata (each 3%), chilopoda (2%) and gastropoda (1%) of the whole, respectively. In regards to usage, 68 species utilized as food products and medicinal uses, totaled 98.55% followed by one species for cosmetics (1.45%).ConclusionThis study indicated that the animals are still being used by the local healers of Palakkad district, to treat various illnesses. The empirical knowledge reported in this study will provide outstanding possibilities for the discovery of new sources of medicine for the drug industry.Systematic notions of significant human impacts on regional and global climate change and species extinctions developed first in the French and British colonial empires. Building on classical Greek theories linking deforestation to rainfall decline the colonial climatic theorists were stimulated by the Newtonian thinking of Stepben Hales and his disciples. The new climate theories led to pioneering forest protection schemes in Tobago, St Vincent, St Helena, Mauritius and western India where the East India Company actively promoted conservation. The Royal Society of Arts, the Academie des Sciences and the Royal Geographical Society all acted as institutional mechanisms for encouraging forest protection based on fears of climate change, long before early environmentalism developed in the United States.Tropical dry evergreen forests (TDEF) are a unique forest type found along the east coast of India. They mostly occur as small, isolated fragments of varying sizes (0.5 to ≈10\\xa0ha) and are considered as endangered forests types in peninsular India. Although plant diversity is well documented in these forests, there is a paucity of ecological studies vital for conservation and for planning restoration activities. We studied reproductive biology of 13 woody species: four trees, six shrubs, and three lianas in fragments of TDEF in southern India. The phenology of reproduction, floral biology, anthesis and sexual system of each species were recorded. The pollination mode was assessed through observations of the visitation frequency of pollinators and from the floral characters. The breeding system was determined by hand-augmented self- and cross-pollination experiments. The plants flowered during the dry season from January to July. Plants of nine species had both flowers and fruits at the same time. Twelve species were hermaphrodites and one was polygamo-dioecious. Flowers of 11 species opened at dawn and two at dusk. Four species were self-incompatible and six were self-compatible. Natural fruit set ranged from 10% to 56%, self-incompatible species having low fruit set. Cross-pollen augmentation increased fruit set, suggesting presence of outcrossing in all species. The majority of plants species (85%) had a generalized pollination system, receiving visits from diverse insects, such as social bees, solitary bees, wasps, moths and flies. However, only few of them were functionally important for the species. Two species namely: Capparis brevispina and C. zeylanica had butterflies and birds, respectively, as their main pollinators. Our data reveal that there is a predominance of outcrossing in plant species and a generalized pollination system in these forests. We suggest that restoration of TDEFs is crucial as habitats, not only for wild plants but also for pollinating insects.Ethnopharmacological relevanceAlthough many plants are claimed to possess anticonvulsant/antiepileptic (AC/AE) properties, but there is very little information available about plants used by various ethnic communities in different parts of India to treat epilepsy, one of the most common disorders of central nervous system (CNS); this communication provides significant ethnomedicinal information on the plants used by indigenous communities: Bhoxa, Tharu and nomadic Gujjars of sub-Himalayan region, Uttarakhand, India to treat epilepsy, so that it could be used as a baseline data for studying chemical constituents and biological activities of these promising plants.Aims of the studyTo record herbal preparations used by the presently studied communities for treating epilepsy and discuss AC/AE properties of the recorded plants.Research strategy and methodsNinety one traditional healers (29 Bhoxa, 35 Tharu and 27 nomadic Gujjars) in sub-Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, India were interviewed to collect information on herbal preparations used by them for treating epilepsy. For each recorded species the use value (UV) and fidelity level (FL) was calculated.ResultsA total of 24 plants belonging to 24 genera and 22 families were used by the presently studied communities in 26 formulations to treat epilepsy. According to FL and UV values, most preferred species for the treatment of epilepsy by Bhoxa community are Ricinus communis L. and Datura stramonium L.; by nomadic Gujjar community are Martynia annua L., Bacopa monnieri (L.) Wettst. and Ricinus communis L.; and by Tharu community are Allium sativum L., Asparagus racemosus Willd. and Achyranthes aspera L. Eight plants viz., Allium sativum L., Boerhavia diffusa L., Cassia fistula L., Clerodendrum viscosum Vent., Datura stramonium L., Inula cappa DC., Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz and Pavetta indica L. recorded in the present survey have been reported for the first time in treatment of epilepsy by these indigenous communities in India. Five out of these eight newly reported plants viz., Cassia fistula L., Clerodendrum viscosum Vent., Inula cappa DC., Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz and Pavetta indica L. have not been pharmacologically evaluated yet for their possible AC/AE properties.ConclusionsDetailed research on the listed plants and their derivatives may be undertaken to provide new alternative treatments and therapeutic uses for epilepsy or other diseases of CNS. We hope that this article will stimulate further investigations into natural products for new AC/AE agents from the recorded ethnomedicinal plants.Understanding carbon stocks relative to tree species is important for managing tropical forests in a way that will result in the carbon emission reductions and biodiversity conservation required under the REDD+\\xa0scheme. Here we analyse inventory data from 179 sample plots in semi-evergreen forests of three provinces in Cambodia. Across all study sites, 5,995 trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥10\\xa0cm, comprising 79 species from 38 families, were analysed. Tree species of the Dipterocarpaceae were most common (10 species), followed by the species of Caesalpinaceae, Combretaceae and Ebenaceae. Analysis of relative carbon stocks (RCS) suggested that Lagerstroemia calyculata Kurz (RCS=14.3%), Syzygium sp. (6.8%), Shorea vulgaris (5.0%), Irvingia malayana (4.8%), Anisoptera costata Kort (4.6%), Vatica astrotricha (4.2%), and Dehaasia cuneata Blume (3.8%) together accounted for 43.6% of the total average carbon stocks of 99.8±4.8\\xa0MgC\\xa0ha−1. We found that carbon stock is highly correlated to basal area (R2=0.993) but not to stem density (R2=0.153). Using carbon stock values, we estimated the carbon emission due to deforestation of semi-evergreen forests to be 8.3\\xa0TgCO2 \\xa0year−1 in Cambodia between 2002 and 2010. These emissions and the loss of 79 tree species in our study sites could be avoided if financial incentives were available for protecting semi-evergreen forests in Cambodia.By the end of the 21st century in some zones the accelerating climate change affecting this planet will create factorial combinations unknown at this time, which will give rise to climates unlike the present ones. This study presents a numerical and cartographic evaluation of these no-analogue climatic zones, whose consequences for existing ecosystems are quite unpredictable, using a method based on the convex hull in a climate hyperspace and 12 future climate projections for 2080. The percentage of the world surface that will foreseeably be occupied by no-analogue climates by 2080 ranges between 3.5% and 17.5%. The bulk of the no-analogue surface area will foreseeably be located in the Northern hemisphere (>\\xa080%), with more elevated risk in tropical and subtropical latitudes between 10 degrees latitude South and 30 degrees latitude North, preferentially in Africa, South America, the Arabian Peninsula, the Indian Peninsula, the North-West of the Gulf of Mexico, Eastern China and Polynesia. Mean temperatures would appear to be the variables most influencing the process. This affects 32 of the 34 hotspots defined for the planet, especially tropical forests in South America and Asia. 6.8% of these conservation-critical surfaces are predicted as no-analogue areas. Population density is greater in the areas that will probably develop no-analogue climates in the future than in those that will not.ObjectiveTo evaluate the preliminary phytochemical screening of the flower extracts of Rhododendron arboreum (R. arboreum) Sm. ssp. nilagiricum (Zenker) Tagg.MethodsThe preliminary phytochemical screening was performed by the standard methods as described by Harborne.ResultsThe phytochemical analysis carried out on the flowers of R. arboreum Sm. ssp. nilagiricum (Zenker) Tagg showed the presence of phenols, saponins, steroids, tannin, xanthoprotein and coumarin.ConclusionsThe present study suggested that the flower extracts of R. arboreum Sm. ssp. nilagiricum (Zenker) Tagg possess significant phytochemical constituents and it can be used as antimicrobial agents against clinically isolated pathogens.Soil erosion along degraded hill slopes has been a problem of serious concern throughout the world. In India, about 5330 million tones (16.4\\xa0t/ha) of soil is being lost every year. Conventional methods of bench terracing coupled with dry rubble packed bunds are being used on steep slopes of plantation area situated along the Western Ghats, to reduce surface erosion. But these conventional methods prove unsuitable in many of the steep slopes which are highly susceptible to erosion. A permanent and self-propagating vegetal cover is found to be an ideal solution to 90% of the erosion problems. Stabilisation of soil along the hill slopes using natural and locally available materials such as coir is a recent technique. Natural and biodegradable fibres such as coir and jute in the form of nettings can aid in vegetative turfing along the slopes. These nettings are intended to protect the seeds and the soil until the sites are permanently stabilised with vegetal cover, by providing a physical barrier between the soil particles and rainwater. The coir netting spread over seeded slopes shields the soil and seeds from the impact of rain drops, minimise runoff and slows down its velocity, maintains the capacity of soil to absorb water, holds the soil particles and seeds in place and retains soil moisture. When seeds germinate, they grow through the gaps in the fabric and achieve a cover all over as the biodegradable coir netting begins to degrade. This technology is applicable to highly erodable slopes where mechanical methods such as tillage or terracing prove unsuitable. This paper presents the methodology followed in monitoring soil erosion in a hill slope stabilised by coir geotextile aided vegetative turfing. Improvement in various soil parameters in such a protected slope is analysed by a comparison of results from a similar unprotected slope.Quantifying the magnitude of human-induced biodiversity loss is a critical yet daunting challenge. Recently, species extinction rate estimates using island biogeography theory have once again been called into question. Here we highlight two of the many factors making the traditional application of this approach problematic for measuring biodiversity loss: first, the extreme assumption that native habitats are surrounded by a sea of human enterprise largely incapable of sustaining native biodiversity and, second, the sole use of species-level extinction estimates, which always underestimates the loss of biodiversity. Here we show that a wide array of taxa make human-dominated, farming countryside their home beyond the borders of native habitats. With data on native tropical birds, we show how simple species numeration masks dramatic differences between habitat types in community composition (e.g. species diversity or functional diversity). Overlooking the countryside biota, coupled with a scientific paradigm that underestimates biodiversity loss by equating it with species extinction, will only exacerbate the ongoing crisis. This is especially true given the rapid expansion and intensification of agriculture threatening countryside biotas, and a persistent limited understanding of how population extinctions and changes in community composition alter ecosystem functioning and services that support human life and wellbeing.Hedychium coronarium (Zingiberaceae) is a perennial rhizomatous herb widely used for its aromatic, cosmetic and medicinal value. In the present research, the morphological, phytochemical and molecular diversity was assessed for 50 H. coronarium accessions collected from different states of Eastern India. The accessions were morphologically diverse with leaf number, leaf length, leaf width, rhizome diameter and rhizome dry weight characters showing the highest variation. A total of 44 constituents were identified in the essential oils with β-pinene (11.87–35.16%), eucalyptol (13.12–39.82%), linalool (1.58–41.33%) and coronarin-E (1.14–33.87%) as the predominant constituents. Using 10 Inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) and 5 Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers, a total of 71 and 34 bands were amplified, respectively. The average polymorphism, polymorphic information content, marker index were found to be 86.30%, 0.57, 3.26 and 87.58%, 0.55, 3.01 for ISSR and RAPD markers, respectively. Cluster analysis based on phytochemical and molecular characterization exhibited a clear relationship between diversity pattern and geographical origin. The percentage of variance explained using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was 70.31% and 71.91% for ISSR and RAPD markers, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) analysis revealed high genetic variability occurred among the population than within populations. Bayesian analytical model and cluster analysis showed similar grouping patterns. The findings of the present research revealed a high degree of molecular and phytochemical variation among H. coronarium populations in relation to geographic locations. The results of the present research can be exploited for conservation and breeding programmes of H. coronarium for its genetic improvement.Many geospatial tools have been advocated in spatial ecology to estimate biodiversity and its changes over space and time. Such information is essential in designing effective strategies for biodiversity conservation and management. Remote sensing is one of the most powerful approaches to identify biodiversity hotspots and predict changes in species composition in reduced time and costs. This is because, with respect to field-based methods, it allows to derive complete spatial coverages of the Earth surface under study in a short period of time. Furthermore, remote sensing provides repeated coverages of field sites, thus making studies of temporal changes in biodiversity possible. In this paper we discuss, from a conceptual point of view, the potential of remote sensing in estimating biodiversity using various diversity indices, including alpha- and beta-diversity measurements.Representations of land use change in hydrologic impact assessment studies mostly rely on static land use information of two points in time, even though the availability of dense time series of land use data allows for the incorporation of dynamic land use changes. We compare the hydrologic impacts of dynamic land use change assessments to those of static land use change assessments. These effects are illustrated with the help of two land use scenarios applied to a hydrologic model of a rapidly developing meso-scale (2036\\xa0km2) catchment upstream of Pune, India. The results show that a linear dynamic land use development could be better approximated with the static approach than a non-linear development. An analysis of the impact of the frequency of land use updates indicates that the prediction of non-linear land use change impacts already improves substantially when frequent land use information every five to nine years is used.Long term forest research sites in India, going by different names including Linear Tree Increment Plots, Linear Increment Plots, Linear Sample Plots and Permanent Preservation Plots, cover diverse plant communities and environmental conditions. Presently, some of these long-term observational studies are functional, some are disturbed and others have almost been lost. The accumulated data will become increasingly important in the context of environmental modelling and climate change, especially if the plots and data can be maintained and/or revived. This contribution presents the history and current state of forest research plots in India, including details of locations and re-measurements. We provide a brief introduction of the National Forest Inventory (NFI), Preservation Plots in natural forests, the 50-ha Mudumalai Forest Dynamics Plot as part of the Centre for Tropical Forest Science and Smithsonian Institution Global Earth Observatories network (CTFS–SIGEO), and research plots established in plantations for tree growth studies and modelling. We also present some methodological details including assessment and analysis for two types of observational studies, the Tree Count Plots (TCP) and Tree Re-measurement Plots (TRP). Arguments are presented in favour of enumeration and analysis methods which are consistent with current approaches in forest ecological research.Understanding how and why diversification rates vary across evolutionary time is central to understanding how biodiversity is generated and maintained. Recent mathematical models that allow estimation of diversification rates across time from reconstructed phylogenies have enabled us to make inferences on how biodiversity copes with environmental change. Here, we explore patterns of temporal diversification in Uropeltidae, a diverse fossorial snake family. We generate a time-calibrated phylogenetic hypothesis for Uropeltidae and show a significant correlation between diversification rate and paleotemperature during the Cenozoic. We show that the temporal diversification pattern of this group is punctuated by one rate shift event with a decrease in diversification and turnover rate between ca. 11\\xa0Ma to present, but there is no strong support for mass extinction events. The analysis indicates higher turnover during periods of drastic climatic fluctuations and reduced diversification rates associated with contraction and fragmentation of forest habitats during the late Miocene. Our study highlights the influence of environmental fluctuations on diversification rates in fossorial taxa such as uropeltids, and raises conservation concerns related to present rate of climate change.Study regionIndia.Study focusIndia\\'s groundwater dependence and the crises of depletion and contamination of groundwater resources require the development of a robust groundwater dependence framework. Understanding the challenges of developing a groundwater governance framework for regions of extensive groundwater development versus relatively less-developed areas of groundwater development is important. The groundwater typology is a function of both, the hydrogeological aspects of groundwater and the socio-economic milieu that defines dependency on the groundwater resource, which is significant across users and uses in India. An interdisciplinary perspective is important while managing groundwater resources in India and helping establish groundwater governance.New hydrological insights for the regionParticipatory forms of groundwater management, using ‘aquifer-based, common pool resource’ approaches have begun to find their way into the practices and policies dealing with groundwater in India. Participation at all levels is important in management decisions as well as in the development of a governance framework, knowing that groundwater development in India has been ‘atomistic’ in nature. Developing a regulatory framework that is supportive of ‘protection’ of the resource as well as ‘good practices of participatory groundwater management’ is essential in groundwater governance. Interdisciplinary ‘science’ must form the medium of promoting both groundwater management and governance instead of using it in the largely business-as-usual approach to groundwater resource management that remains ‘infrastructure’ based, ‘supply-side’.India ranks first in rainfed agriculture globally in both area (86\\xa0Mha) and the value of produce. Rainfed regions in India contribute substantially toward food grain production including 44% of rice, 87% of coarse cereals (sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), maize (Zea mays)), and 85% of food legumes, 72% of oilseeds, 65% of cotton, and 90% of minor millets. Overall, the rainfed areas produce 40% of the food grains, support two-thirds of the livestock population, and are critical to food security, equity, and sustainability.India is home to 18% of world\\'s population, 15% of the world livestock, 4.2% of fresh water resources, 1% of forests, and 0.5% of pasture land, but only has 2.3% of the geographical area. India is home to 25% of the world\\'s hungry population of ∼1 billion along with an estimated 43% of children malnourished under the age of five. The net sown area in India has remained constant for several years at 141\\xa0Mha, but the human and livestock populations have been steadily increasing. Though the Indian population increased from 361 million in 1951 to 1140 million in 2011, tripling over 60\\xa0years, the food-grain production has more than quadrupled, but the yield gains are largely from the irrigated agroecosystems. Notwithstanding the increase in average productivity from 0.6\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1 in the 1980s to 1.1\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1 at the present time, large yield gaps exist for rainfed crops in the semiarid regions. Even after realizing the full irrigation potential, nearly 40% of the net sown area of 141\\xa0Mha will remain totally rainfed. The per capita availability of land has fallen drastically from 2.4\\xa0ha in 1951 to about 0.32\\xa0ha in 2001; and it is projected to decline further to 0.09\\xa0ha by 2050. Increasing productivity of rainfed cropping systems is of critical importance to meet the food demands of an ever-increasing population in India.The potential productivity of maize (Z. mays) in high rainfall regions under rainfed condition is 8.0\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1 vis-a-vis the national average yield of 2.1\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1, indicating an unbridged yield gap of ∼6\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1. Large yield gaps exist in other crops as well which are primarily grown under rainfed conditions. Recommended management practices (RMPs) such as improved cultivars, site specific nutrient management (precision agriculture), and water harvesting and recycling can potentially increase the yields in several crops up to 6\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1, indicating the large realizable potential under rainfed conditions. There are many districts in India where the actual yields are much lower than the national average, and there is enormous potential for improvement. The objective of this article is to discuss the production potentials and the yield gaps of predominant crops grown under rainfed conditions in India, biotic and abiotic constraints, and RMPs for realizing the potentials.Energy is a vital component of any society playing a pivotal role in the development. Post oil crises shifted the focus of energy planners towards renewable resources and energy conservation. Biomass is one such renewable, which accounts for nearly 33% of a developing country’s energy needs. In India, it meets about 75% of the rural energy needs. In Karnataka, non-commercial energy sources like firewood, agricultural residues, charcoal and cow dung account for 53.2%. The energy released by the reaction of organic carbon (of bioresources) with oxygen is referred to as bioenergy. Bioresource availability is highly diversified and it depends on the region’s agroclimatic conditions. Inventorying of these resources is required for describing the quality, quantity, change, productivity, condition of bioresources and requirement in a given area. The present study assesses bioresource status across the agroclimatic zones of Karnataka, considering the bioenergy availability (from agriculture, horticulture, forests and plantations) and sector-wise energy demand (domestic, agriculture, industry, etc.).Bioresource availability is computed based on the compilation of data on the area and productivity of agriculture and horticulture crops, forests and plantations. Sector-wise energy demand is computed based on the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO study) data, primary survey data and from the literature. Using the data of bioresource availability and demand, bioresource status is computed for all the agroclimatic zones. The ratio of bioresource availability to demand gives the bioresource status. The ratio greater than one indicates bioresource surplus zones, while a ratio less than one indicates scarcity.The study reveals that the central dry zone (1.4), the hilly zone (3.79), the southern transition zone (3.12) and the coastal zone (3.40) are bioresource surplus zones, whereas the northeastern transition zone (0.48), northeastern dry zone (0.23), northern dry zone (0.58), eastern dry zone (0.39), southern dry zone (0.93) and northern transition zone (0.45) come under bioresource-deficient zones. Among the bioresource surplus zones, horticulture residues contribute significantly towards bioenergy in the central dry zone, southern transition zone and the coastal zone, while in the hilly zone the main contributor of bioenergy are agricultural residues. Amidst the bioresource-deficient zones, agriculture is the major contributor of bioenergy in the northeastern transition zone (52%), northern dry zone (59%), and northern transition zone. Based on the bioenergy status of the zones and land use pattern, feasible management and technical options have been discussed, which help in optimising the available bioenergy and in building a sustainable energy society. This study also explores various programmes that can be initiated and implemented like social, community and joint forest management involving public participation. Such schemes will lessen the burden on the existing resources and also help the rural masses to procure biomass on a sustained basis.Joint Forest Management (JFM), embracing the philosophy of forest conservation and livelihood improvement through cooperation between state and civil society, has emerged over the past decades both as a specific paradigm of forest governance in India and as India\\'s largest community forestry program. The JFM program, evolved during early 1970s covering a few forest villages as a model for reversing the trend of degraded forest ecosystem through the active protection by local villagers. The JFM program is implemented currently by 106,482 Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMC) and it covers 22 million ha of forests spread across 28 constituent states of India and union territories.JFM emerged against a backdrop of two centuries of centralised bureaucratic control over forest management in India. Centralized control during the 19th and 20th centuries failed either to conserve resources or to contribute substantially to the well-being of local populations. However, inconsistent persuasions from decentralization policies in India under present forest policy (1988) have prompted people to analyse the theoretical basis for accepting that decentralization would bring improvements in forest ecosystem management. Still others have contested the de facto rationale for decentralization (i.e., improved forest management) and have suggested that decentralization may be a manipulation by elites to serve their own interests or to shift power, for example from national to international agencies that have funded decentralization. Thirty years from its inception, there are now concerns for the recent effectiveness of JFM (over the past 20 years) because it is a group action that is getting old and is perhaps losing some of its pioneering drive and innovativeness.Although JFM has been administered nationally, decisions on implementation detail have been left to the individual states, resulting in different strategies. The long history of JFM has also provided scope for experiences with it to change over time as well as between places.Given the range of experiences with and perceptions of JFM, as well as the importance of the objectives JFM ostensibly serves, the time is ripe therefore for a retrospective evaluation to take stock of its actual achievements, its status and ways forward. The current paper seeks to provide such a review and analysis.The paper highlights design and implementation issues related to government resolutions, benefits-sharing and forest offences. It also assesses the critical design factors and key drivers responsible for institutional reforms. The paper evaluates impacts of protection on forest productivity and on the livelihoods of local communities. It highlights that the JFM program, by virtue of the diversity of its implementation, provides an ideal laboratory for exploring why similar reforms can lead to different outcomes. The paper argued that though there are supporting government policy and guideline and massive fund support, why there has been a low down of enthusiasm for JFM in the last two decades. From experiences, it suggests strategies for its revival and JFM can further contribute effective toward forest conservation and enhanced livelihood opportunities in the future.Tropical and subtropical islands benefit from a wide spectrum of renewable energy resources and advancement in technology has made it feasible for harnessing these clean and abundant energy sources. Mauritius being located in the tropical belt, receives plenteous sunshine all year round. Consequently, to provide assistance to the Government and other relevant organizations wishing to deploy photovoltaic facilities on the island, the methodological framework and results presented have been organized to serve as a strong background to identify the optimum sites for efficient harnessing of solar energy through photovoltaic systems. The Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) analysis coupled to Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) have been used to model the solar photovoltaic potential of the island from a set of social, technical, legal, environmental and climatological factors. The performance of the model has been calibrated using the monthly fluctuations in electricity production from a photovoltaic power plant located on the island. We propose an adapted mathematical formula to theoretically estimate the electricity production from photovoltaic systems on the island on the temporal basis. The outcome of this research is the production of a high resolution yearly mean solar photovoltaic map alongside with the spatio-temporal variability of photovoltaic potential throughout the year.This study examined the use of Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) to effectively manage fishing impacts on all ecosystem components, as required under Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management (EBFM) principles. A consequence of changing from input controls to output-based (catch) management is that the control of the regulating authority tends to be reduced, which may affect the outcomes for ecosystem management. This study reviewed the use of input controls across six fishing methods in 18 ITQ fisheries, which have been independently accredited as ecologically sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council (12 fisheries) or under Australian environmental legislation for Wildlife Trade Operation (six fisheries). Input controls were retained across a range of ITQ fisheries, with non-selective fisheries such as trawl, gillnet and line employing more input controls than selective fisheries such as purse-seine, pot/trap and dredge. Further case-studies confirmed the widespread and recent use of input controls (spatial and temporal closures) with the aim of managing ecosystem impacts of fishing. The retention of input controls, particularly closures affects the security (quality of title) characteristic of the fishing use right and the theoretical ability of fishers to manage their right for their future benefit. The security characteristic is weakened by closures through loss of access, which undermines industry trust and incentive for long-term decision making. By reducing the security of ITQs, individual fisher incentives and behaviour may separate from societal objectives for sustainability, which was one of the foremost reasons for introducing ITQ management.Many invasive alien species (IAS) are used by local communities for a variety of subsistence and income generating purposes. This frequently poses a conflict of interest for their removal due to forest conservation and biodiversity concerns. However, if local use can simultaneously check or control specific IAS, the conflict can be avoided and both development and forest conservation perspectives accommodated in the short to medium term. We examine this for Lantana camara invasion in southern India through assessment of the demand for and impacts of harvesting on this globally problematic IAS. We interviewed local artisans regarding their knowledge and quantities of Lantana used, along with forest surveys to estimate Lantana densities and size classes in harvested and unharvested sites, and lastly we undertook controlled cutting in moist and dry deciduous forests in both the wet and dry seasons to examine rate of regrowth and mortality. Over the entire study area the abundance of Lantana far outweighed local demand, but at small scales around villages, density and size classes were significantly reduced through harvesting. The controlled cutting experiment showed marked seasonal differences, with the most severe cutting intensity resulting in significant mortality when Lantana plants were cut in the wet season, but with limited effect when cut in the dry season. We conclude that promoting local use of IAS may be a feasible approach in controlling them and thereby limiting their impacts in forests.This essay examines the presence of Yamuna in the city of Delhi, from two perspectives: (i) understanding riverscapes as simultaneously aquatic and terrestrial and (ii) understanding these as conjoining issues of environment and technology. With events over the course of the last century as its backdrop, the essay focuses on the last few decades of the twentieth century, to examine the relation of land and river in Delhi; the interface of people and projects, especially the issue of slums; and the risks posed to the river on account of waste and pollution. All these featured prominently in the events leading up to the staging of the Commonwealth Games in Delhi in October 2010, which provides the most immediate context for this essay. In conclusion, I propose that the current strategies of rejuvenating the river are limited, often anti-poor and far from sustainable.Salacia chinensis L. (family – Hippocrateaceae) is a convenient source for industrial scale isolation of antidiabetic and anticancerous drug ‘mangiferin’ which is extensively used in both traditional and modern medicines. High demands from pharmaceutical industries lead the indiscriminate harvesting from the wild which created the pressure on natural populations. Micropropagation system was developed using different explants for both commercialization and conservation of S. chinensis. Murashige and Skoog’s (MS) medium with different concentrations and combinations of plant growth regulators (PGRs) viz. 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), kinetin (KN), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) were used during various in vitro regeneration stages. Maximum rate of shoot multiplication (75%) and maximum number of shoots (6.7\\xa0±\\xa01.0) were obtained with MS medium fortified with BAP (2.0\\xa0mg/l), NAA (0.8\\xa0mg/l) and ascorbic acid (100\\xa0mg/l). The antioxidants and other additives significantly altered the rate of shoot multiplication, number of shoots as well as survival rate of shoots. The plantlets rooted on ½MS\\xa0+\\xa0IBA 1.5\\xa0mg/l, showed 80% establishment in soil without any morphological variation. The genetic integrity of the regenerated plants was further confirmed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) analysis. A total of 3871 distinct bands were produced by 12 RAPD and 17 ISSR primers in mother and 20 randomly selected micropropagated clones wherein 3858 (99.66%) bands were monomorphic and rest of 13 (0.34%) were polymorphic. The high level of monomorphism confirms the genetic uniformity of the micropropagated clones. Additionally, reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) analysis at various in vitro regeneration stages showed uniformity in terms of presence of mangiferin however, the amount of mangiferin varied across regeneration stages. Phytochemical and molecular fingerprinting of micropropagated clones revealed that the in vitro regeneration protocol developed could be successfully used for industrial-scale propagation of S. chinensis with enhanced production of mangiferin.Projected droughts for 21st century over India have been analysed using precipitation and temperature data obtained from Regional Climate Models (RCMs) under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized effective Precipitation Evapo-Transpiration Index (SP*ETI) and Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at the timescale of 12-months have been used for drought characterization. The K-means clustering algorithm has been utilized to delineate distinct drought homogeneous regions in India. Trends and periodicities in drought characteristics have also been analysed. The results of this study reveal that increase in evapotranspiration due to projected rise in temperature would play a major role in affecting future drought dynamics in most parts of India. Analysis indicates that computed magnitude of drought intensity, duration and frequency depends on the choice of drought indicator. SPEI drought index has been found to project highest drought risk as compared to other two indices used in this study. North India is more vulnerable to increase in drought severity and frequency in near future. However in far future, most parts of the country, except few southeastern states, are likely to face an escalation in drought severity and frequency. A shift in drought hazard from central India toward southeast-central India is likely to happen with increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration. The areal extent of droughts has been found to be increasing historically which is expected to increase further in future for most parts of the country. Historically, drought dynamics were more influenced by decrease in precipitation. However, in future, the drought dynamics will be significantly influenced by increased evapotranspiration resulting from increase in temperature in spite of likely increase in precipitation. The periodicity analysis indicates inter-annual periodicities influencing monsoon months to be distributed uniformly across all clusters of the Indian subcontinent with dominant cycles of 2–3.6\\u202fyears. Further, change in periodic cycles of drought due to climate change is found to be insignificant.Memecylon subcordatum (Melastomataceae) is an endemic and critically endangered species of the Kalakkad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in India. Twenty five inter-simple sequence repeat primers were used to screen 86 individuals. Nine primers produced a total of 61 bands (6.77 bands primer−1) ranging from 200 to 1900 bp wherein 48 bands were of polymorphic. Polymorphism was 78.69% within the species, 26.60% within the populations and 7.41%–48.15% among the populations. Genetic variation varied from 0.3069 (within species) to 0.1182 (within populations). The poor gene flow among the populations (Nm: 0.3133) could be due to the genetic barriers caused by the tributaries of Tambraparani river. The coefficient of genetic differentiation between the populations (GST) was 0.6148. The Bayesian analysis, multidimensional scaling analysis and principal coordinates analysis grouped all the 11 populations under 4 clades. The Mantel test showed significant correlation between the matrices of genetic and geographic distances (r\\u202f=\\u202f0.652, P\\u202f<\\u202f0.001) ranging from 8 to 44\\u202fkm. The phylogram constructed by internal transcribed spacers to 13 Memecylon species showed 2 distinct clades wherein Memecylon angustifolium, an associate present along the river banks and at damp localities in the southern Tropical wet evergreen forests from 678 to 1432\\u202fm MSL, revealed close affinity. In addition to conserve all the existing natural populations in this protected area, the authors suggest to utilize genetic diversity-rich saplings and stem cuttings from 6 populations and to sow seed coat-removed seeds to enhance the percentage of germination.The present study has estimated spatial distribution of biomass carbon density from satellite remote sensing data, historical archives and collateral data from 1930 to 2013. The spatial forest canopy density datasets for 1930, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013 were analysed to obtain biomass carbon pools at 5\\xa0km grid level. The overall loss of forest cover was 28% from 1930 to 2013. Analysis of change in the forest canopy density indicates that the dense forest cover reduced from 419,175\\xa0km2 in 1975 to 390,966\\xa0km2 in 2013. The total above ground biomass carbon stock of Indian forest was calculated as 3070.27\\xa0Tg\\xa0C in 2013. Standing biomass carbon stocks varied significantly during different steps of time periods. There are a total 67,184 grid cells with loss of carbon stocks during 1930–1975 followed by 55,742 cells during 1975–1985. The annual carbon loss in the above ground biomass showed the highest decrease during the period of 1930 to 1975 and estimated as 2168.50\\xa0Tg\\xa0C while the net annual loss of carbon is 48.19\\xa0Tg\\xa0C. The maximum observed net annual loss of carbon stocks was 53.97\\xa0Tg\\xa0C during 2005 to 2013. Carbon content for various states shows that maximum carbon stocks were stored in the forests of Arunachal Pradesh (11.27%) in 2013. State-wise change analysis indicates the highest loss of carbon stocks in Tripura (80.99%) from 1930 to 2013. Overall reduction in carbon stock in Indian forests has been estimated as 3079.98\\xa0Tg\\xa0C (50.08%) from 1930 to 2013. The spatial characterization of distribution and changes in carbon stocks can provide useful information for planning and strategic management of resources and fulfilling global initiatives to conserve forest biodiversity.Ethnopharmacological relevanceMaharashtra is the third largest state in India with a large tribal population. Documentation of traditional knowledge through ethnobotanical studies is important for conservation and utilization of indigenous knowledge. Diarrhoeal diseases are the second largest cause of morbidity in rural India. Medicinal plants given by the traditional healers of Parinche in Pune district, Maharashtra are known to be efficacious for many common ailments, including diarrhoeal diseases.Aim of the studyEthnobotanical survey of antidiarrhoeal plants from Parinche valley towards the documentation and conservation of traditional knowledge.Materials and methodsInterviews and inquiries were conducted amongst traditional healers, indigenous communities and village elders.ResultsOne hundred and eighty two plants used by tribes and natives for different ailments were documented of which 28 flowering plants were for diarrhoea. Leaf was the most preferred plant part. Amongst the 28 plants, antidiarrhoeal activity of five plants viz., Caesalpinia sepiaria, Dioscorea pentaphylla, Launaea pinnatifida, Syzygium rubicundum and Ziziphus jujuba has not been reported previously. Two species viz., Ziziphus xylopyra and Syzygium rubicundum are endemic to India.ConclusionParinche valley is an ethnobotanically rich area with abundant availability and knowledge of medicinal plants that can serve as a model for low cost health care.Water security is a major concern in recent years, especially, in semi-arid and arid regions, which are adversely impacted due to extensive anthropogenic and climatic changes across the globe. Present study investigates the long-term changes in streamflows, their quantitative attribution and socio-environmental implications for a climatically sensitive Tapi basin in west central India. The abrupt and gradual changes in streamflows have been detected over the period 1973–2013 using non-parametric Pettit\\'s and Mann-Whitney U tests; and Modified Mann-Kendall, Spearman\\'s Rho and Sen\\'s slope estimator tests respectively. The streamflow analyses revealed heterogeneity across the basin, wherein the tributaries exhibited higher variability in annual runoff compared to the Tapi River. The spatial analyst tool of ArcGIS has been used to graphically demonstrate the spatial variability in rainfall and streamflow trends across the basin. The streamflows exhibited predominantly decreasing trends across the basin, except in the upper reaches of the Tapi River. The decreasing trends in streamflow are largely attributed to anthropogenic activities such as changes in the land use patterns viz., increase in agriculture area, construction of minor and medium hydraulic structures, decrease in forest cover, rapid urbanization, excessive groundwater extraction and streamflow regulations. The anthropogenic activities played a major role in declining streamflow trends in the Tapi basin, contributing about 68%–99% (average 85%) decline in total runoff, compared to rainfall variability, which contributed around 1%–32% (average 15%) decrease in total runoff. The analysis of water stress levels at sub-catchment scale exhibited significant rise in percentage of population living in the basin facing chronic water shortage (i.e., <1000\\u202fm3/capita/year), from 34.0% in year 1981 to 63.2% in year 2011, mostly in semi-arid regions. The reduction in water availability clearly highlighted the deteriorating water quality and stream ecology of the Lower Tapi River in Surat city, India.Ethnopharmacological relevanceDevelopment of a new term which describes the contemporary, composite, constituent sciences of ethnopharmacology.Aim of the studyTo discuss the polysyllabic term cyberecoethnopharmacolomics in the context of the future of ethnopharmacology in global health care.Materials and methodsLiterature background and assessment from the prior literature, diverse databases, and personal discussions.ResultsThe profiles and literature background with contemporary and future thoughts regarding the concepts and practices of cyber-, eco-, ethno-, pharmacol-, and -omics, and their impact in ethnopharmacology for the future are presented in the context of integrated health care systems.ConclusionsEthnopharmacology has a major role to play in global health care if the relevant sciences and cutting-edge technologies can coalesce synergistically as a responsive, evidence-based health care practice.Four-horned antelope is one of the smallest Asian bovids, endemic to India and Nepal. Despite its wide distribution in India, the species has received very little scientific attention. We studied its habitat preference, activity budget, diet, social behaviour and breeding in Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary. Among tropical dry deciduous and thorn forests, where the species is distributed, higher abundance was observed in dry deciduous areas (0.26 individuals/km, 95% CI\\xa0=\\xa00.22–0.29) especially the short grass habitat associated with stunted and sparse tree growth known as ‘tree-savanna’ than the dry thorn forest (0.09 individuals/km, CI\\xa0=\\xa00.001–0.18). The antelopes follow a bimodal feeding pattern with 52% morning (06:00–10:00\\xa0h) and 65% evening (14:00–18:00\\xa0h) devoted to feeding. Diet was studied by analyzing 59 pellets collected from two major habitat types during the dry season. Of the 52% of the diet components identified, grass (28.6%, 14 species) and browse biomass (23.3%, 10 species; with five herbs (9.6%), one shrub (5.6%) and leaves and fruits from four trees (8.2%)) constituted equal parts indicating a mixed feeder category. Mean group size of 1.5 (±0.71 SD range: 1–4) individuals estimated from 94 direct sightings with solitary individuals (62%) and adult with fawn/s (11%) constituting over 70% of the sightings indicating a non-herding nature of the species. Newborns were sighted from February to May with a peak during April and the reported gestation period of c. 8 months suggests mating taking place during June–August. Mean litter size was 1.6 (±0.53 SD, n\\xa0=\\xa09). The study suggests the need for including dry thorn forest habitats of Sigur plateau in the existing protected areas and detailed studies for long-term conservation of the species in this region.ed services’ provided by forest ecosystems are receiving increasing attention in the research and policy arena. Changes in forest cover in tropical regions take many different forms and result in multi-dimensional changes in watershed processes: soil erosion rates, peak and low-flow levels, groundwater recharge rates, and water quality. These changes are in turn mediated by the socio-technical context to create a variety of context-specific human impacts, which constitute watershed ‘services’ (or ‘dis-services’). Over the past decade, understanding of the biophysical linkage has generally become nuanced. But large gaps remain in regions like south Asia and Africa and on the question of how different types of forest transitions affect low flows, and the socio-hydrological links are inadequately studied. Economic valuation studies are still plagued with conceptual errors, oversimplified biophysical models, lack of social and technological context, and focus on lump-sum numbers. Greater integration of concepts, methods and latest results, and attention to context-specificity, are required for generating policy-relevant insights.What happens when global institutions try to assist community conservation in some of the world\\'s least industrialised areas? Among the `cutting edge\\' projects grant-aided by the Global Environment Facility (GEF, a World Bank-hosted fund for `global environmental benefits\\') are `CAMPFIRE\\' – the Communal Areas Management Programme For Indigenous Resources – in Zimbabwe, and `India Ecodevelopment\\'. Both are intended to combine protection of biodiverse wildlife with participatory rural development for impoverished local communities. We explore the `ground truths\\' of these projects in two historical and political contexts. We ask whether aspiring managers of `global resources\\' can sufficiently transcend ongoing tensions in `local political ecology\\', while diverse value systems and experiences remain distant. We conclude with thoughts about the `sustainable development\\' of foreign missions old and new.Camptothecin, a pyrroloquinoline alkaloid, is one of the most promising anti-cancer drugs. Although this compound has been reported to exist in several species, the highest concentration (about 0.30%) has been reported from Nothapodytes nimmoniana. In this study, we described the dynamics of camptothecin and methoxy camptothecin accumulation during fruit development, seed germination and their role on seed pathogens and seed pests. HPLC analysis revealed camptothecin and methoxy camptothecin content high (0.28%) in stage-3 and decreased in the later stages. Whereas, in the different parts of the fruit, the maximum accumulation in the endosperm (0.46%) of stage-3 followed by the embryo, seed coat, and fruit coat. The pattern of accumulation of both the metabolites were decreasing at the time of seed hydration, early seed germination (0.12%–0.08%) and thereafter it is increasing up to 8-week seedlings (0.08%–0.39%). The growth inhibition of five seed-borne fungal pathogens and fecundity of pulse beetles on chickpea seeds were tested for different concentrations of camptothecin ranging from 0.01 to 10\\u202fμg\\u202fml−1 for the sensitivity. At 10\\u202fμg\\u202fml−1 concentration the fungal isolates were severely inhibited. The lowest number of eggs (106) laid was observed on 10\\u202fμg\\u202fml−1 concentration compared to the control (169). The results showed that camptothecin is found in plants have a role in defense against insect herbivores and pathogens involved in deterrence/antifeedant activity or toxic.The influence of the pedogenic and climatic contexts on the formation and preservation of pedogenic carbonates in a climosequence in the Western Ghats (Karnataka Plateau, South West India) has been studied. Along the climosequence, the current mean annual rainfall (MAR) varies within a 80\\xa0km transect from 6000\\xa0mm at the edge of the Plateau to 500\\xa0mm inland. Pedogenic carbonates occur in the MAR range of 500–1200\\xa0mm. In the semi-arid zone (MAR: 500–900\\xa0mm), carbonates occur (i) as thick hardpan calcretes on pediment slopes and (ii) as nodular horizons in polygenic black soils (i.e. vertisols). In the sub-humid zone (MAR: 900–1500\\xa0mm), pedogenic carbonates are disseminated in the black soil matrices either as loose, irregular and friable nodules of millimetric size or as indurated botryoidal nodules of centimetric to pluricentimetric size. They also occur at the top layers of the saprolite either as disseminated pluricentimetric indurated nodules or carbonate-cemented lumps of centimetric to decimetric size.Chemical and isotopic (87Sr/86Sr) compositions of the carbonate fraction were determined after leaching with 0.25\\xa0N HCl. The corresponding residual fractions containing both primary minerals and authigenic clays were digested separately and analyzed. The trend defined by the 87Sr/86Sr signatures of both labile carbonate fractions and corresponding residual fractions indicates that a part of the labile carbonate fraction is genetically linked to the local soil composition. Considering the residual fraction of each sample as the most likely lithogenic source of Ca in carbonates, it is estimated that from 24% to 82% (55% on average) of Ca is derived from local bedrock weathering, leading to a consumption of an equivalent proportion of atmospheric CO2. These values indicate that climatic conditions were humid enough to allow silicate weathering: MAR at the time of carbonate formation likely ranged from 400 to 700\\xa0mm, which is 2- to 3-fold less than the current MAR at these locations.The Sr, U and Mg contents and the (234U/238U) activity ratio in the labile carbonate fraction help to understand the conditions of carbonate formation. The relatively high concentrations of Sr, U and Mg in black soil carbonates may indicate fast growth and accumulation compared to carbonates in saprolite, possibly due to a better confinement of the pore waters which is supported by their high (234U/238U) signatures, and/or to higher content of dissolved carbonates in the pore waters. The occurrence of Ce, Mn and Fe oxides in the cracks of carbonate reflects the existence of relatively humid periods after carbonate formation. The carbonate ages determined by the U–Th method range from 1.33\\xa0±\\xa00.84\\xa0kyr to 7.5\\xa0±\\xa02.7\\xa0kyr and to a cluster of five ages around 20\\xa0kyr, i.e. the Last Glacial Maximum period. The young occurrences are only located in the black soils, which therefore constitute sensitive environments for trapping and retaining atmospheric CO2 even on short time scales. The maximum age of carbonates depends on their location in the climatic gradient: from about 20\\xa0kyr for centimetric nodules at Mule Hole (MAR\\xa0=\\xa01100\\xa0mm/yr) to 200\\xa0kyr for the calcrete at Gundlupet (MAR\\xa0=\\xa0700\\xa0mm/yr, Durand et al., 2007). The intensity of rainfall during wet periods would indeed control the lifetime of pedogenic carbonates and thus the duration of inorganic carbon storage in soils.This article contributes to the diversity and stand structure of the mangroves in Kerala, India, using multivariate methods. Floristic diversity of mangroves comprised 18 species of true mangroves, of which\\xa0Sonneratia alba, Avicennia alba, and Ceriops tagal were found to be rare, whereas Bruguiera parviflora was extinct in the state. Structural analyses revealed the importance of Avicennia officinalis and the domination of Acanthus ilicifolius. The mean stem density ranged from 10 to 13846 no/ha, whereas the mean basal area ranged from 0.02 to 20.19\\xa0m2/ha. Multivariate analysis of true mangroves could be classified into five floristic groups based on stem density. Group 1 comprised Rhizophora mucronata, R. apiculata, Ceriops tagal, Kandelia candel, Sonneratia alba, and S. caseolaris, which were seen in the fringing zone. A combination of Group 2 and Group 3 comprised Avicennia marina, A. alba, Lumnitzera racemosa, Acrostichum aureum, Excoecaria agallocha, E.\\xa0indica, Avicennia officinalis, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, and Aegiceras corniculatum, found in the intermediate zone, whereas Bruguiera sexangula and B.\\xa0cylindrica occurred in the landward regions which constituted Group 4. Acanthus ilicifolius, having a widespread distribution, was found in all the three zones represented by Group 5. Tidal elevation was found to be important in shaping the observed zonation.Phoenix sylvestris is commonly known as Indian date and is native to India and southern portions of Pakistan. It is traditionally important and known for its nutritional values throughout the world. It is a rich source of carbohydrate, phenols, amino acids, flavonoids, tannins, alkaloids, terpenoids, dietary fibers, essential vitamins and minerals. Different parts of the plant exhibit diverse medicinal properties such as being antipyretic, cardiotonic, laxative, diuretic and antioxidant. In the present review, an attempt has been made to compile most of the information available regarding the distribution, cultivation, phytochemical characteristics, Ayurvedic properties, ethno-pharmacological, medicinal and non-medicinal uses of P.\\xa0sylvestris in the last four decades.In the present study, an attempt has been made to ascertain the storage capacity of Mannapalla lake, Manipal, Udupi District, India, by conventional method, and to understand the change in the land use pattern. The work involved is of twofold. The actual field survey has been carried out by total station and the storage capacity is found. In the second step, Survey of India toposheet and Satellite data of 2002, 2009 and 2011 is used to generate the land use land cover map and the study has been carried out to identify the changes in land use land cover pattern in the vicinity of the lake. The volume of Mannapalla lake is obtained to be 690650.3m3 using prismoidal method. There is significant change in Land use pattern has been observed from 2002 to 2011, i.e. the area under vegetation has considerably decreased and more buildings and structures have sprung.Development of regional biome models represents a new stage of earth systems modeling. By translating simulated climate variables and actual vegetation boundaries into maps of biomes, these models explicitly link the vegetation and climate patterns together, enabling the determination of trajectories of climate change. Through this research, a new one million scale biome map of India is prepared, based on actual vegetation cover type map derived from wide field sensor onboard Indian remote sensing satellite (IRS WiFS—spatial resolution 200\\xa0m) and Holdridge life zone (HLZ) system. A biome level characterization (BLC) model has been developed wherein, temporal satellite data helps to define the phenologically discriminant vegetation cover type, climatic parameters viz., biotemperature, mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration ratio have been used to identify potential life zones and finally describe the biome boundaries based on the vegetation cover type and life zones. The study identifies 35 cover classes and describes 17 vegetation cover types. This is close to the type description given by Champion and Seth [Champion, H.G., Seth, S.K., 1968. A Revised Survey of Forest Types of India. New Delhi Government Publication, New Delhi.] in their forest cover type map. The geographical analysis identifies 19 HLZs seven biomes and 19 sub-biomes in the Indian sub-continent. The dataset is now available for diverse application studies in ecosystem modeling, land cover dynamics and global change.An efficient genetically stable regeneration protocol has been established in Rauvolfia serpentina (L) Benth ex. Kurz, an important medicinal plant, used for the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases. Here, in this present study, plants were regenerated through organogenesis (direct and indirect) and embryogenesis pathways. This is the first ever somatic embryo formation report of R. serpentina in liquid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium from isolated root segments. The genetic fidelity of the regenerated plants was also analysed by flow cytometry. The 2C DNA content of the regenerated plants raised through organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis was measured along with field grown natural plants, which served as donor plant. The estimated 2C DNA levels are 2.08, 1.76 and 1.88\\u2009pg in direct, indirect and somatic embryo regenerated plants respectively while in field grown plant it was noted to be 1.94\\u2009pg in R. serpentina. This is perhaps the first ever 2C DNA estimation study in tissue culture raised plants along with natural population of Rauvolfia, an immensely important medicinal plant, present in India. We developed improved callus mediated shoot regeneration (indirect) protocol from leaf callus. Highest shoot regeneration percentage (66.10%) with 4.0 shoots / callus mass was noted on 2.0\\u2009mg\\u2009l−1 BAP\\u2009+\\u20090.5\\u2009mg l−1 NAA added MS medium. The shoot tips and nodal explants on 2.5\\u2009mg\\u2009l−1 BAP amended MS medium induced direct shoot buds, with highest shoot regeneration frequency (81.45%) from shoot tips. On 1.0\\u2009mg\\u2009l−1NAA added MS medium maximum numbers of roots (8.87) were noted, indicating the effectiveness of NAA over IBA in rooting. Excised roots were cultured in agitated liquid MS medium and in 1.0\\u2009mg\\u2009l−1 NAA added conditions somatic embryos were formed. The mature somatic embryos germinated on 1.5\\u2009mg\\u2009l−1 BAP\\u2009+\\u20090.25\\u2009mg l−1 GA3 supplemented MS medium. The histology and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) evidences have been presented to describe the in vitro morphogenesis process. The well-rooted plantlets were acclimatized and transferred to soil successfully (79%). The flow cytometric analysis showed no signiﬁcant variation in nuclear DNA contents, hence was observed to be genetically stable with their genome size similar to field grown Rauvolfia plants.ObjectiveTo elucidate the medicinally important herbs and their role in the health cares of the villagers living in Sivagangai district of Tamil Nadu, India.MethodsInterviews and detailed personal discussions were conducted with the herbalist and local people to identify plants and collect the medicinal informations for 12 months (from June 2009 to May 2010). The medicinal important plants were botanically identified.ResultsTotally 71 species of 61 genera belonging to 36 families were reported with ethnomedicinal values. Leaves are the mostly used part to prepare medicine. Generally fresh parts are used.ConclusionsAttention should be made on proper exploitation and utilization of these medicinally important plants.Bidens biternata (Lour.) Merr. and Sheriff. (B. biternata) belonging to family Asteraceae, is a common easy to grow, widespread, pestiferous crop weed and a wasteland plant species. It is a wild edible plant rich in macronutrients and micronutrients. B. biternata is extensively used in traditional medicine against inflammation, infections, diabetes, malaria, leprosy, ulcers and diarrhea and digestive disorders. Present review highlights the up-to-date information on the botanical properties, phytochemistry, bioactivities, traditional and medicinal uses of B. biternata from the literature. In addition to botanical studies and records of the traditional use of B. biternata in over 26 diseases, scientific studies investigating the potential medicinal uses of B. biternata and its constituent phytochemicals are presented and discussed. The present review provides preliminary information and gives direction for further research into this plant.Due to urbanization and population growth, the degradation of natural forests and associated biodiversity are now widely recognized as a global environmental concern. Hence, there is an urgent need for rapid assessment and monitoring of biodiversity on priority using state-of-art tools and technologies. The main purpose of this research article is to develop and implement a new methodological approach to characterize biological diversity using spatial model developed during the study viz. Spatial Biodiversity Model (SBM). The developed model is scale, resolution and location independent solution for spatial biodiversity richness modelling. The platform-independent computation model is based on parallel computation. The biodiversity model based on open-source software has been implemented on R statistical computing platform. It provides information on high disturbance and high biological richness areas through different landscape indices and site specific information (e.g. forest fragmentation (FR), disturbance index (DI) etc.). The model has been developed based on the case study of Indian landscape; however it can be implemented in any part of the world. As a case study, SBM has been tested for Uttarakhand state in India. Inputs for landscape ecology are derived through multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques in an interactive command line environment. MCDM with sensitivity analysis in spatial domain has been carried out to illustrate the model stability and robustness. Furthermore, spatial regression analysis has been made for the validation of the output.Senecio candicans DC is an endemic sub-shrubby climber and the hot water extract of this plant is being used traditionally for the treatment of gastric ulcer. The first objective of the present study was to design a standardized protocol for in vitro regeneration of S. candicans from leaf explants and compare the antioxidant activities of aqueous extracts of in vitro calluses and in vivo leaves by three different methods. Callus was initiated on Murashige and Skoog\\'s (MS) basal media supplemented with various concentrations (0.5\\xa0mg\\xa0L−\\xa01 to 2.0\\xa0mg\\xa0L−\\xa01) and combinations of auxins and cytokinins under dark incubation for 2\\xa0weeks. The percentage of callus induction (PCI) and the fresh weights were recorded after 28\\xa0days of culture. The fresh weights were again recorded after 4\\xa0weeks of sub-culture to determine the relative fresh weight growth (RFWG). The highest PCI of 87% and RFWG of 3.245 were obtained on an MS medium supplemented with 6-benzyl amino purine (BA) 2\\xa0mg\\xa0L−\\xa01 and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) 2\\xa0mg\\xa0L−\\xa01. The callus obtained after 28\\xa0days of culture were inoculated on MS medium supplemented with different growth regulators. The maximum average shoot length (4.28\\xa0±\\xa00.27\\xa0cm) and maximum percentage of shoot induction (81%) was observed on MS medium supplemented with BA (2.0\\xa0mg\\xa0L−\\xa01)\\xa0+\\xa0IAA (1.0\\xa0mg\\xa0L−\\xa01). The maximum root induction percentage (90%) from shoots was observed on half strength MS medium fortified with 3.0\\xa0mg\\xa0L−\\xa01 α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) alone. The antioxidant activity of in vivo leaf was significantly high compared to the in vitro callus in all the three antioxidant assays. A linear correlation between antioxidant activity and the total phenolic content was observed. The current protocol for in vitro regeneration would pave the way for further research on the isolation of bioactive compounds including antioxidants by cell suspension culture.Rehabilitation of degraded lands needs appropriate mix of land use and erosion control measures, and is often associated with carbon (C) sequestration in the soil profile. However, topographic attributes play a deterministic role in the rate of C accretion in degraded sloping lands. This study was carried out to assess the effect of slope aspect on soil C sequestration, soil aggregation and soil moisture retention in aggradation phase of a denuded land in eastern India. Eight treatments of horti-silvi-pastural system integrated with in-situ moisture conservation were taken in randomized block design during 2000 to 2006. Indigofera teysmanni was taken as the silviculture component and hedgerows of the species were used uniformly for all the treatments. A significant interaction effect of the rehabilitation system and slope aspect was observed for residual soil moisture content, soil organic C (SOC) content, SOC stock, size distribution of aggregates and C content in aggregate fractions. Treatments with trenches of 0.45\\xa0×\\xa00.45\\xa0×\\xa01.0\\xa0m dimension at 0.5\\xa0m\\xa0u/s of fruit plants conserved significantly higher soil moisture even at 87\\xa0mm of evaporativity. On an average, the north facing (NF) aspect had 1.13 and 0.75\\xa0g 100\\xa0g−\\xa01 higher soil moisture than the east facing (EF) aspect in the 0–15\\xa0cm and 15–30\\xa0cm soil depths, respectively. The SOC concentration was higher by 11–12% in the NF than the EF aspect. In the 0–30\\xa0cm soil profile, the SOC stock varied from 31.55 to 37.91\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−\\xa01 in the EF aspect and from 35.01 to 41.28\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−\\xa01 in the NF aspect, as compared to the initial stock of 18.19 and 19.06\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−\\xa01 in the two aspects, respectively. The NF aspect had 0.35 to 3.17\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−\\xa01 higher SOC stock in the 0–15\\xa0cm soil, 0.64 to 3.03\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−\\xa01 in the 15–30\\xa0cm soil and 1.85 to 4.59\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−\\xa01 in the whole 0–30\\xa0cm soil profile. Averaged over all the rehabilitation systems, the NF aspect accumulated extra C to the tune of 0.19, 0.18 and 0.36\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−\\xa01\\xa0yr−\\xa01 than the EF aspect in the 0–15, 15–30 and 0–30\\xa0cm soil layers, respectively. Under all the systems and slope aspects, small macroaggregates (>\\xa0250\\xa0μm) constituted the highest proportion, with values varying from 50.4–65.4% in the EF to 61.7–71.7% in the NF aspect. The C content in small macroaggregates was also higher than that in microaggregates and silt\\xa0+\\xa0clay size fractions. The study indicates slope aspect to be a significant factor in soil C sequestration, which also affects the aggregation pattern of soils under recovery.ObjectiveTo screen the antimicrobial potential of three ethnomedicinal plants Chassalia curviflora Thw. (C. curviflora), Cyclea peltata Hook. F. & Thomson (C. peltata) and Euphorbia hirta L (E. hirta) used in folk medicines in Aarukani hills Kani tribe, Tamil Nadu, India against human bacterial pathogens.MethodsAntibacterial efficacy was performed by disc diffusion method against the pathogens viz., Escherichia coli (E. coli) (ATCC 35218), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (ATCC 6538), Salmonella typhi (S. typhi) (MTCC 733), Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) and Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C.ResultsThe maximum degree of antibacterial activity was observed in C. peltata followed by C. curviflora. While E. hirta showed comparatively low degree of antibacterial activity. The methanolic extract of C. peltata showed the antibacterial activity against three pathogens viz., S. pyogenes, P. vulgaris and E. coli with the inhibition zones 12 mm, 10 mm and 9 mm, respectively. hexane extracts of C. peltata also showed the antibacterial activity against two selected pathogens viz., P. vulgaris and P. mirabilis with 15 mm and 12 mm of inhibition zones. All the three different concentrations (0.25, 0.50 & 0.75 mg/mL) of methanolic extract of C. peltata show the inhibitory effect on the three susceptible bacteria S. pyogenes, P. vulgaris and E. coli with the maximum inhibition in the highest concentration (0.75 mg/mL). The methanolic and hexane extracts of C. curviflora exhibited the antibacterial activity against only one bacterium each i.e. P. vulgaris and S. typhi with the maximum zone of inhibition 13 and 11 mm respectively. The methanolic and hexane extracts of E. hirta exhibited the antibacterial activity against only one bacterium i.e. S. pyogenes with the maximum zone of inhibition 13 and 11 mm respectively.ConclusionsThe present investigation revealed that the C. curviflora, C. peltata and E. hirta are potentially good source of antibacterial agents and demonstrates the importance of such plants in traditional medicines.Biodiversity surveys were conducted in 13, 10×50 m2 plots located between 1400 to 3700 m above mean sea level in a range of habitats in temperate mixed Oak and Coniferous forests through sub-alpine to the alpine grasslands in Chamoli district of Uttaranchal state in the Indian Garhwal Himalaya. Cross-taxon congruence in biodiversity (α-diversity and β-diversity) across macrolichens, mosses, liverworts, woody plants (shrubs and trees) and ants was investigated, so as to examine the extent to which these groups of organisms can function as surrogates for each other. Although woody plants provided a major substrate for macrolichens and mosses, there was no species-specific association between them. Woody plant species richness was highly positively correlated with mosses (r2=0.63, P<0.001), but the relationship was not particularly very strong with lichens and liverworts. While there was a significant correlation in the species turnover (β-diversity) of macrolichens with mosses (r2=0.21, P<0.005), the relationship was relatively poor with the woody plants. On the other hand, negative correlations emerged in the species richness of ants with those of macrolichens, mosses and woody plants (r2=−0.44, P<0.05), but most of the complementarity (turnover) relationships among them were positive. Since diversity between taxonomic hierarchies within the group was consistently significantly positively correlated in all these taxa, the higher taxonomic categories such as genus and family may be employed as surrogates for rapid assessment and monitoring of species diversity. Although no single group other than macrolichens has emerged as a good indicator of changes in species richness in all other groups, some concordant relationships between them conform to the hypothesis that species assemblages of certain taxonomic groups could still be used as surrogates for efficient monitoring of species diversity in other groups whose distribution may further predict the importance of conserving overall biodiversity in landscapes such as the Garhwal Himalaya.Jackfruit is cross-pollinated and mostly seed propagated, a wide range of variation exists in fruit quality. With the development of efficient vegetative propagation methods, excellent genotypes selected from these seed propagated seedlings will gradually replace other genotypes in jackfruit producing areas. In this study, genetic diversity of 50 jackfruit accessions from three provinces in China was analyzed based on amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) markers. A total of 320 unambiguous bands were produced by eight primer combinations, and 65 (20.3%) of them were polymorphic. Genetic similarity coefficients ranged from 0 to 0.9841, with an average of 0.5000, indicating a moderate genetic diversity in this collection. The dendrogram derived by unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean algorithm (UPGMA) analysis revealed five groups, and no correlation between genetic relationship and geographical origin were found. Accessions of soft and firm flesh type were not clustered into distinct groups, neither could yearly bearing once, or twice fruit accessions. This study has provided useful information for collection and preservation of jackfruit germplasm worldwide.Swertia is a diverse genus of herbs belonging to the family Gentianaceae and comprising roughly 170 species distributed throughout the world, but is most diverse in temperate and subtropical regions and in montane tropics. In Bhutan, China, India, Japan, and Nepal, some Swertia species are recognized for their anthelmintic, anti-inflammatory, activity, finding use in traditional medicine to treat malaria fever, liver diseases, gastric trouble, jaundice, diabetes, hepatitis, and other ailments. The aim of the present review is to provide updated and comprehensive information on the genus Swertia, for promotin the development and uses of such ethnomedical resources.Swertia species have been used in Indian traditional medical systems, the traditional Chinese system, and traditional Tibetan folk medicine for treating various ailments. In China, it has also been used as medicinal herbs for treating hepatitis, cholecystitis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, dysentery, and scabies. Broad spectrums of phytochemicals such as xanthonoids, iridoids/secoiridoids, flavonoid, alkaloids, and terpenoids have been identified from Swertia spp. The crude extracts and isolated metabolites from Swertia spp. exhibited a wide range of in vitro and in vivo biological and pharmacological activities, including anticancer, anti-diabetic, antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-hepatitis, anthelmintic, anti-leishmanial, neuroprotective, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, hepatoprotective, gastric emptying and gastrointestinal motility, inhibitors of 5α-reductase, β-glucuronidase inhibitory, anti-Benign prostatic hyperplasia and anti-mutagenic activities.The extensive literature survey reveals that Swertia species have been used for medicinal purpose in various parts of the world and there is significant traditional evidence of their uses. Additional research is required targeting individual ingredients responsible for the pharmacological effects, elucidating its mechanisms of action as well as safety and toxicological assessment.Saraca asoca (Fabaceae) is a prime ingredient in Asokarishta, a well-known Ayurvedic preparation for gynecological ailments. Due to scarcity, adulteration or substitution of related raw drugs is a common practice in its preparation. The bark of Kingiodendron pinnatum (Roxb. ex DC.) Harms, morphologically similar to S.\\xa0asoca (Asoka) is a widely used substitute. The present study aimed to evaluate the pharmacological effectiveness of K.\\xa0pinnatum as an alternative for S.\\xa0asoca in Asokarishta by determining the inhibitory effect of estrogen induced uterus endometrial thickening in immature female rats. Arishta was prepared using S.\\xa0asoca and with the substitute, K.\\xa0pinnatum as per Ayurvedic Pharmacopeia. Uterus endometrial thickening was induced by the administration of estradiol (20\\xa0μg/kg b. wt, i.p) to 8-day-old rats for 5 alternate days. On day 16, following estradiol administration, the serum estrogen level was found elevated to 156.5\\xa0±\\xa08\\xa0pg/ml from the normal value 32.4\\xa0±\\xa05\\xa0pg/ml and consequently increased the thickness of uterus endometrium from 16.7\\xa0±\\xa01.4 to 75.2\\xa0±\\xa015.3\\xa0μm. Upon oral administration of 400\\xa0μl/kg b. wt Asokarishta (ASA) and Arishta made with K.\\xa0pinnatum (AKP), the thickening was reduced to 42.5\\xa0±\\xa012.7 and 47.1\\xa0±\\xa010.5\\xa0μm and the estrogen level diminished to 102.6\\xa0±\\xa010 and 97.3\\xa0±\\xa08\\xa0pg/ml, respectively. Arishta also reduced the chronic/acute inflammations in mice and improved the antioxidant status of rats. No toxic symptom was observed in the animals by the treatment of Arishta. The study supports the use of K.\\xa0pinnatum as an alternative to S.\\xa0asoca in Asokarishta and gives a scientific validation for Asokarishta in gynecological ailments.ObjectiveTo evaluate the rattus biological control program in Iranian Persian Gulf Island, Abu-Musa.MethodsThis study was conducted on the Iranian island of Abu-Musa during April 2012 to March 2013. The rattus trapping was done using commercial live and baited rat trap, in different parts of the island. Also the island of Qeshm, with a similar weather and climatic conditions in the Persian Gulf was considered as a control area, which any comprehensive rattus control plan has not been implemented during the implementation of rattus biological control program on Abu-Musa Island. All ectoparasites were collected and stored at 70% ethanol. Ectoparasites, including fleas, lice and mites were identified using identification keys. In addition, a number of released mongooses were captured and identified.ResultsDespite a year of trapping on the island, no rattus were caught in the traps. While on the island of Qeshm, as a control location, rate of rat trappings was estimated 33.3%. Among the 27 captured rodents in two islands, a total of 89 ectoparasites including fleas, Xenopsylla astia (32 females, 18 males) and Cetenocephalides felis (9 females, 7 males), louse, Polyplax spinulosa (8 females, 2 males) and mite, Laelaps nuttalli (13 females and males) were collected.In this study, the introduced mongoose on the island of Abu-Musa, which has established and increased their population and been distributed in all parts of the island, was identified as Indian gray mongoose, Herpestes edwardsii.ConclusionsThe introduced Indian gray mongoosehas successfully eradicated the rattus population in island of Abu-Musa, but we have no information about its direct and indirect impacts on other native faunal elements of this island.Geospatial presentation of habitat status has become a key issue for planning conservation. Biodiversity characters of the habitat provide the basis of prioritizing the sites in conservation effort. Since India is identified as one of the 12-mega biodiversity countries in the world, this task is of great significance. In India, biogeographers have long since recognized North-East India as one of the most diverse regions with respect to flora and fauna. Since historic times, human interventions had started influencing the landuse and landcover of this region. Deforestation is mainly attributed to shifting cultivation and commercial logging of timber. This has resulted in fragmentation of the landscape. Landscape fragmentation and degradation have been identified as fundamental reasons for biodiversity loss. The paper uses landscape ecological principles for biodiversity characterization. Satellite remote sensing data have been used for characterization of the landscape and stratification for ground inventory. A geographic information system has been used to spatially model the disturbance regimes and to integrate the ground based nonspatial data with the spatial characters of the landscape. The vegetation types and landuse of Meghalaya have been mapped using Indian remote sensing (IRS) time series data. The various parameters (viz. patch shape, patch size, number of patches, porosity, fragmentation and juxtaposition) have been analyzed on the most recent landcover map to spatially present the disturbance regimes. A spatial model incorporating ground based biodiversity attributes of the landscape elements, landuse change patterns, disturbance regimes of the landscape and terrain complexity have been used to delineate the spatial pattern of biological richness. This has been achieved using the landscape analysis package (LAP) developed at the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing. Habitat evaluation using ground based data and their spatial organization have been found to provide reliable information on the biodiversity distribution pattern. The present approach for prioritizing the biodiversity rich sites have the advantage of integrating spatial, non-spatial information and horizontal relationships. The information is finally presented in space and time. This approach will facilitate conservation prioritization, systematic inventory and continuous monitoring.ObjectiveTo study the ethnomedicinal uses by the Kuruma tribals for discovering new drugs to cure cuts and wounds so as to provid the data scientifically evaluated.MethodsA survey was conducted during May 2008–September 2009 to collect information on medicinal plants used by the Kuruma tribes and queries were made on the various species of plants used regularly and occasionally to cure cuts and wounds.ResultsThe present study includes information on 34 plant species belonging to 32 genera and 25 families used by Kuruma tribe of Wayanad district of Kerala for the treatment of cuts and wounds.ConclusionsThe present study of the knowledge on the folklore uses of the medicinal plants used by Kuruma tribes leads to effective utilization of herbal medicines in the future.Tropical homegardens with high agrobiodiversity have high potential for carbon (C) sequestration, especially under changing environments. Floristic diversity, richness, and aboveground C stocks and how size of homegardens influence agrobiodiversity and C sequestration potential were assessed in the Kerala homegardens. A total of 839 homegardens in 28 panchayaths (lowest unit of local self-government) of Thrissur, Palakkad, and Malappuram districts were surveyed through a stratified random process. Information was gathered on holding size, floristic composition, plant height, and girth at breast height (GBH) of all trees and shrubs (>20\\xa0cm GBH). Aboveground C stocks of trees were computed using allometric relationships, assuming C as 50% of biomass. The homegardens were also classified into small (<0.4\\xa0ha), medium (0.4–1.2\\xa0ha), and large (>1.2\\xa0ha). In total, 473 species were recorded, of which 208 were trees (>20\\xa0cm GBH), 86 shrubs, and 179 herbs. Simpson\\'s floristic diversity index (0.64, 0.41, and 0.46 for a subset of small, medium, and large homegardens, respectively), species richness, and tree density (per hectare) were highest for small-sized holdings. Large-sized homegardens, however, had more stems per garden. Average aboveground standing stocks of C ranged from 16 to 36\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1, with small homegardens having higher C stocks on unit area basis than large- and medium-sized ones. Implicit in this is the potential for C sequestration and agrobiodiversity conservation, especially by small homegardens.onsidering the importance of sustainable production practices with greater resource use efficiency, a study was conducted during 2009–12 to understand the soil properties, crop yield, and economics as affected by the integrated crop management (ICM) practices under the Bhoochetana (soil rejuvenation) program in Karnataka, India. Results from 3776 crop-cutting studies on different crops (cereals, pulses, and oilseeds) revealed that there is a vast spatial variability in case of various soil nutrients across different taluks of Karnataka. Balanced fertilizer application, both in rainfed and irrigated areas, directly influenced crop yields. Yields of cereals, legumes, and oilseeds were 3590, 1400, and 2230\\xa0kg\\xa0ha−1 with improved management practices as compared to 2650, 1030, and 1650\\xa0kg\\xa0ha−1 with conventional farming practices, respectively. Average net income estimated from conventional farming was Rs. 26,290\\xa0ha−1, while it was Rs. 35,540\\xa0ha−1 from improved management practices, which indicated that ICM practices resulted in an additional 35% income. The oilseeds performed better in terms of achieving higher net income and benefit–cost ratio while the cereals and legumes also have shown significant improvement in yield compared to the yields from conventional farming practices. The detailed findings on soil properties, yields of crops, and economics suggested that there is a vast potential for crop productivity improvement through ICM practices across different soil types and rainfall zones of Karnataka, India.Ophiorrhiza mungos var. angustifolia is a member of Rubiaceae family can be a gold standard for the in vitro production of high-value anticancer compound camptothecin to meet the increasing market demand for medicine. Multiple shoot cultures of Ophiorrhiza mungos var. angustifolia was induced in the nodal explant using half-strength Murashige and Skoog solid media supplemented with different concentrations of cytokinins (4.44–22.19\\u202fμM Benzyl adenine and 4.65–23.23\\u202fμM Kinetin either individually or in combination) and auxins (4.92–24.6\\u202fμM Indole butyric acid, 5.37–24.6\\u202fμM Indole acetic acid and 5.71–28.54\\u202fμM in combination with Benzyl adenine) for three weeks. Among the plant growth regulators treated, benzyl adenine (8.88\\u202fμM) was found to be the most effective in multiple shoot induction (22\\u202f±\\u202f3.90 shoots/explant), thus further shoot multiplication is achieved in fresh media with the same composition. Increased camptothecin production is achieved by the elicitation of multiple shoots using methyl jasmonate (50, 100, 150 and 200\\u202fμM), salicylic acid (50, 100, 150 and 200\\u202fμM) and chitosan (10, 50,100 and 150\\u202fmg/l) separately under a different period of incubation. The results showed 7 fold increase in the production of camptothecin (0.74\\u202f±\\u202f0.05\\u202fmg/g dry weight of shoots) in shoots elicited with 150\\u202fμM methyl jasmonate for 72\\u202fh compared to the control. (0.14\\u202f±\\u202f0.01\\u202fmg/g dry weight of shoots). Additional shoot bud formations were not observed irrespective of elicitor used. Camptothecin was estimated using high-performance liquid chromatography. The results obtained in the present experiment clearly demonstrate and strongly endorse the suitability of using Methyl jasmonate as a promising and reliable elicitor for enhanced production of camptothecin in Ophiorrhiza mungos var. angustifolia.The residents of Kathmandu Valley in Nepal face increasing water shortages that worsen during the dry season. Against this situation, the Melamchi Water Supply megaproject, supported by several foreign investors, was launched in 2000 to quench Kathmanduties’ thirst by bringing water from Melamchi River through a 26\\xa0km-long tunnel. After more than 10\\xa0years, progress has been very modest. Besides the political instability of the country, opposition from certain sectors of society in both the urban and rural settings has created continuous disruptions of the works. We draw on Urban Political Ecology and Environmental Justice frameworks to analyze two distinct, although interconnected, social struggles battling against the project. The first one, anchored in the urban sphere, took advantage of the entry of the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoists, and succeeded in bringing down Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) lending condition of handing over the water supply management to a private sector operator. The second one concerns the ongoing struggle of the rural residents affected by the inter-basin transfer. Local people in the rural areas mainly advocated conservation of their source of livelihood and political recognition. In the last part, we discuss how the use of local water sources and community-based alternatives may emerge as an alternative to hegemonic models of nature–society relations and contribute to overcome such conflicts and reduce negative impacts on the environment and social injustices.The present study aims at evaluating three soil erosion models; Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE); Unit Sediment graph (USG) and Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP). The models were tested on small watersheds within the Pamba River basin of Kerala, India, using the data on observed rainfall-runoff-sediment yield events. Three watersheds are selected with varying land use types, topography and drainage density. Three erosion models were applied for the same rainfall events and the results were compared with the observed sediment yield values. It was seen that the USG predicted the rate of sediment yield better than the other two models. Even though WEPP is a physically distributed model, the large and detailed data requirement, which is impractical in studies of this scale, affected its prediction accuracy. Application MUSLE gives the large errors compared to the observed sediment yield. Therefore, it was found from this study that the Unit Sediment Graph (USG) based approach is having better applicability for the prevailing climatic and geographical setup.Invasion of native communities by exotic species has been among the most perverse ecological problems in recent years. In the present study, we predicted the probable distribution of two invasive plant species Mimosa diplotricha Sauvalle and Mikania micrantha Kunth in a protected tropical grassland of Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park, Assam, Northeast India using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) distribution modelling algorithm. We found that about 30–40% (25–30\\xa0km2) area of the protected area (78.8\\xa0km2) have high chances of being invaded by both the invasive plants that are prime habitat to the greater one horned Rhinoceros and other important grassland dwellers. Both the models have an accuracy of AUC\\xa0>\\xa00.99. Precipitation in warmest quarters played a major role among the environmental variables in spread of both the invasive plants. The findings of the present study will help the management authority to take the necessary steps in the identified area to chalk out a comprehensive strategy for control of the invasive plant species. The probable areas most likely to be invaded by the invasive plant species have to be monitored regularly, and intervention like manual uprooting needs to be scheduled during the early stage of its life cycle and before flowering. The frontline staffs of the national park need to be apprised about the ecology and impact of invasive plants for better monitoring and eradication of these detrimental plants.Tropical dry deciduous forests play a significant role in regulating the biogeochemical cycles. Present study assesses the carbon stock of tropical dry deciduous forests varying in tree density, basal cover, and diversity located in Singrauli district of Madhya Pradesh in Central India. Field sampling was carried out in six forest sites viz., Chitrangi, East Sarai, Gorbi, Renukoot, West Sarai, and Waidhan, of Singrauli. A total of 29 tree species belonging to 18 families were recorded across the forest ranges where tree density, basal area and diversity values varied from 702 (Gorbhi Range) – 1671 (East Sarai range) individuals ha−1; 15.43 (Renukhund range) – 71.76\\u202fm2\\u202fha−1 (Chitrange range) and 0.69 (West Sarai range) – 2.52 (Gorbi range), respectively. Total biomass estimated ranged from 103.32 (Renukhund range) – 453.54\\u202fMg\\u202fha−1 (Chitrange range) while the total tree carbon density varied from 48.97 to 214.97\\u202fMg C ha−1. The variation in carbon storage in the studied ranges was found dependent on density of trees in different diameter and age classes and tree species diversity. Diospyros melanoxylon, Butea monosperma, Shorea robusta, Senegalia catechu, Spondias pinnata, and Lagerstroemia parviflora were the dominant species at different study sites (forest ranges) and contributed towards higher carbon storage in respective forest ranges. Study endorses field-based approach for carbon estimations based on above and belowground assessments as a more realistic approach to understand sink potential of natural forests.In this study, a finite element method based soil erosion and sediment yield model has been developed for overland and stream flow. The one dimensional conservation of mass of sediment flow equation has been solved based on kinematic wave flow approximation and Galerkin\\'s based numerical solution. Various thematic maps required for the model are prepared using Geographical Information System (GIS). Land use/Land cover is extracted from remotely sensed data. The proposed finite element based distributed model has been used for the estimation of soil erosion and sediment outflow by discretizing the watershed into small grids. The soil erosion and sediment outflow model has been developed and applied to Khadakohol watershed located in Nashik district of Maharastra state, India. Part of the available data has been used for the model calibration and the other part for model validation. The simulated results of the watershed have been compared with the observed data and found to be satisfactory.This research focuses on the characterization of ancient decorative earthen plaster of India\\'s Pithalkhora group of caves. The restoration strategies being planned for the earthen plaster demand detailed scientific investigation to understand technology and composition so as to prepare matching plaster. The mineralogical, micro-structural and chemical characterization of the earthen plasters have been investigated by analytical tools like petrological microscope, XRF, CHN analysis, laser scattering particle size analyzer, FTIR, XRD, Scanning Electron Microscopy, thermal analyzer (DGA/DTA) as well as on-site observations. A comparative study with nearby sites portrays the earthen plaster of Pithalkhora coarser (silt: 62–100%, sand: 2–2.2%) with traces of clay (0–2%); hence it may be prone to damage by grain breakages. The chemical composition confirms that the aggregates mixed with the earthen plaster belong to that of locally available basaltic origin. SEM studies show addition of quartz and traces of clay (illite and montmorillonite) to augment the flexibility and performance of the plaster. The restoration plaster should be synthesized with aggregates of locally available basaltic rock mixed with slaked lime in addition with rice husk and other vegetal fibres as vegetal additive to overcome the shrinkage of the plaster.Camptothecine, a potent eukaryotic topoisomerase inhibitor, is an important anticancer compound. The global demand for this compound was estimated to be $1\\xa0billion in 2003 and is only further expected to increase. Partly to meet the expected increase in demand, in the recent past, several efforts have been made to discover newer and alternative plant and fungal sources of camptothecine. In this study we report a rich source of camptothecine and its natural derivatives, Pyrenacantha volubilis (Icacinaceae) from the eastern coast of peninsular India. Camptothecine and its derivatives were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) in all plant parts such as twigs, leaves, roots, seedling, ripened whole fruit, fruit coat, seed coat and cotyledons. Cotyledons and ripened whole fruits contained the highest amount of camptothecine (1.35% and 0.60% dry weight respectively). LC-MS and ESI-MS/MS analyses revealed besides camptothecine, other derivatives and precursors such as 10-hydroxycamptothecine, 9-methoxycamptothecine, 20-deoxycamptothecine, deoxypumiloside, strictosidine and strictosamide. Pure camptothecine was isolated from fruits and structurally confirmed using NMR. Seed extracts were found to be effective against breast cancer, ovarian, colon and carcinoma cell lines (with IC50 values of 4.0\\xa0μg/mL, 6.5\\xa0μg/mL, 25.0\\xa0μg/mL and 25.0\\xa0μg/mL respectively). We discuss the results in the context of exploring alternative sources of camptothecine.Ionidium suffruticosum Ging. is a seasonal multipotent medicinal herb belongs to the family Violaceae. The plant claims highest medicinal values and used traditionally to treat diabetes, jaundice, male sterility, urinary tract infections, gonorrhea, bowel complaints, urinary problems and various ailments. No detailed pharmacognistical works are available, hence, in the present study, morphological, microscopical and preliminary phytochemical investigations of the herb were undertaken. All the parameters were studied according to the WHO & Pharmacopoeal guidelines. Anatomical studies showed that secondary growth occurs in roots and basal stocks of stem indicating the seasonal and perennial nature of the herb. Powder microscopy revealed that phloem fibres, xylem vessels with spiral, annular, scalariform lignifications and calcium oxalate crystals were abundant in dried material of the plant. The qualitative chemical tests of the petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and aqueous extracts of plant material revealed the presence of alkaloids, steroids, triterpenoids, flavonoids and carbohydrates.Land use and land cover changes play an important role in the occurrence of vector-borne diseases. It is highly essential to identify the prominent changes responsible for its occurrence so that suitable measures can be adopted. An attempt was made to identify the prominent land use and land cover changes responsible for the spread of chikungunya, malaria, and dengue fever in the State of Kerala, India, using hierarchical cluster analysis and multiple regression analysis. Large extent of water bodies, low land and agricultural land played a significant role on the incidence of chikungunya and malaria. High population density, built-up area and agricultural area favoured dengue fever. Vector-borne diseases were found to be the lowest in places where there is no low land and with higher forest area. Inappropriate disposal of wastes generated in the built-up area might be the reason for the spread of dengue fever. Freshwater in drains of these areas is polluted and form breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Hence much attention is to be paid to provide appropriate treatment and disposal of wastes generated in the built-up area of the State In an evolving urban policy, priority is to be given to the installation of safe treatment and disposal facility of wastes especially, sewage, sullage, and solid waste. The protection of forest land also plays an important role. Economic policy instruments such as Payment for Environment Services (PES) schemes, may constitute a useful tool to encourage an improved land use management through appropriate price signals, such as, for instance, for the preservation of forested areas especially in proximity of highly populated urban environments.Safe drinking water scarcity is an acute problem in the coastal regions of Bangladesh which is mainly caused by salinity intrusion. In this context, drinking water sources are severely affected, including adverse effects on agriculture, health, fisheries and the ecosystem. This research investigates i) selected water quality parameters ii) local people\\'s perception on drinking water scarcity iii) how local people\\'s cope with safe drinking water scarcity. This research was conducted using local water samples, questionnaire survey of 200 households and 4 focus group discussions (FDGs) in Shyamnagar and Tala sub-district of Satkhira district. The study of the water quality parameters exposed the extreme conditions of the drinking water sources in the area. The average values of total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC) and Chloride concentration (Cl−) were found respectively 4044.12\\xa0mg/L, 7186.7\\xa0μS/cm, and 3143.6\\xa0mg/L in Shyamnagar and 2313.60\\xa0mg/L, 4390.3\\xa0μS/cm, and 1402.1\\xa0mg/L in Tala. The result of community perception reveals that local people are aware of the safe water scarcity and nearly all of them perceive that salinity is the main reason behind it. Even though there are a number of socioeconomic factors, communities have their own adaptation technologies to cope with the problem. The study concludes with the development of a community based model defining the key responsibilities of the stakeholders, including local and central government, NGOs and community people to work in a well-coordinated manner which will be effective for reducing the scarcity of the safe drinking water.d management programmes, in terms of conservation planning over a large watershed, must identify the subsets of hydrologic units that are contributing most sediment load in the watershed. It is these priority or critical hydrologic units or sub-watersheds that need preferential soil and water conservation measures to reduce maximum sediment load in the watershed, particularly in arid/semi-arid fragile environments.The semi-quantitative method of the Sediment Yield Index (SYI) model, developed by the All India Soil and Land Use Survey of the Government of India for priority delineation in River Valley Projects, is used in India and studies have revealed that there is an overall reduction of sediment outflows of up to 60%.The paper describes a new concept of introducing Integrated Resources Units (IRUs) in the model. An IRU is the smallest, but viable, planning unit which leads to strategies ideally suited for scientific development of a watershed. The IRUs encompass all the relevant watershed resources, generated from map-, ground- and space-based systems, and is the strategic unit for assigning the erosivity and transportability values of the detached material in the SYI model for gradation of priority classes of sub-watersheds. The IRU approach is also helpful in monitoring the dynamic aspects of the watershed and the consequent redefinement of management strategies. The paper also envisages some future studies for watershed management policies.Complementarity between conservation and productivity objectives makes watershed development attractive in semi-arid areas. A potential trade-off with poverty alleviation arises however because watershed development may benefit landholders while harming landless people, particularly herders and women. India has a history of highly innovative watershed projects in which downstream landholders share benefits by compensating landless people upstream for providing an environmental service. Most current projects, however, take alternative measures that ignore the issue of environmental services. Evidence from 70 villages in Maharashtra suggests the presence of poverty alleviation trade-offs, highlighting the potential value of more explicitly addressing compensation for environmental services.ObjectiveTo evaluate the role of seasons on the phytochemical properties of Azolla microphylla.MethodsDried and powdered leaves (50g) were extracted with 300 ml of methanol using soxhlet extractor for 16 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. Standard methods have been used to screen the phytochemical constituents.ConclusionsFrom the observations it can be concluded that the plant extracts show the presence of several bioactive compounds which could be exploited further.The ethno-botanical documentation among ethnic people in Sathyamangalam wildlife sanctuary, Tamil Nadu, India has been investigated for the first time. A total of 61 medicinal plants having new combination uses were reported with adjuvant in the treatment of dermatological, Genitourinary and gastrointestinal ailments. This study could help in the recovery and conservation of traditional medicine system among educated generation. The present study was aimed to: (1) documentation of the traditional knowledge (2) quantitative analysis using Use value (UV), Informant consensus factor (ICF), Index of agreement on remedies (IAR), Relative frequency citation (RFC) and Cultural Importance index (CII) (3) validation of ethno-botanical data using in silico biological activity and toxicity prediction studies. Semi-structured direct interviews were conducted to acquire information from the study area tribes. Total of 89 tribes including both gender among various communities were interviewed and their ethno-botanical knowledge was documented. The data were assessed using ethno-botanical indices methods to estimate the consistency of usage herbal knowledge in various ailments. A total of 61 species were recorded for treatment of categorized ailments. The collected medicinal information from ethnic groups shows remarkable new usage of medicinal plants to particular ailments. Our comparative in silico studies also supported the traditional medicine results with correspondence to their bioactive. Traditional knowledge of ethnic people also linked to their culture and history. This study also infers the usage of traditional plant based medicine. Further research related to the bioactivities of reported plants should be encouraged to explore the importance in pharmaceutical industry.Ethnopharmacological relevanceTraditional remedies used for the treatment of various ailments are considered to be very important in the primary health care of Reang people living in Tripura state of Northeast India. Novel information gathered from the present investigation is important in preserving folk indigenous knowledge of Reang tribe.MethodsSystematic and exhaustive field surveys were conducted during 2003 to 2004 in Reang inhabited areas of Tripura state of Northeast India covering all the seasons, to gather information on medicinal herbs used by them in the treatment of various ailments. Information was collected from 55 traditional herbalists of different age through structured questionnaires and personal observations made during the field visit. The data obtained was analyzed through informant consensus factor (FIC) to determine the homogeneity of informant\\'s knowledge on medicinal plants also the fidelity level (FL) to authenticate the uniqueness of a species to treat a particular ailment.ResultsIn the present study a total of 125 medicinal plants species belonging to 116 genera and 59 families were presented, used for treating 42 different ailments. The major plant parts used are leaves and most of the remedies are suggested to take orally. The greatest parts of plants used for curing various ailments were found locally. The consensus analysis revealed that the fever and gastro-intestinal diseases have the highest informant consensus factor FIC of 0.79 followed by the dermatological problems (FIC 0.78). It is equal (FIC 0.77) for both general health problems and inflammation and pain while urinogenital problems showed relatively low levels of consensus (FIC 0.63). The level of informants\\' consent was high for most ailment categories indicating greater homogeneity among informants. In the present study we analyzed the disease categories to highlight some of the important plant species in terms of Fidelity level. Greater parts of the plant species achieve highest fidelity level, while only 4% acquire lower FL. The species with high citation and informant concurrence value are reasonably significant. Cyathea, a rare tree fern used for major cuts or wounds for immediate blood coagulation. Extensive local application may threaten the species if not judiciously managed.ConclusionThe traditional pharmacopoeia of the Reang ethnic group incorporates a myriad of diverse flora available locally. Traditional knowledge of the remedies is passed down through oral traditions without any written document. This traditional knowledge is however, currently threatened mainly due to acculturation and deforestation. Therefore, documenting medicinal plants and associated indigenous knowledge can be used as a basis for developing management plans for conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plants of the study area. In addition, findings of this study can be used as an ethnopharmacological basis for selecting plants for future phytochemical and pharmaceutical studies.Genus Impatiens is widely distributed in the areas of Old World tropics and subtropics. Of which, only European and United States Impatiens were examined for genetic diversity analysis. In this study, 10 Indian Impatiens were studied for their interspecies genetic diversity based on inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers and morphological characters. All 73 DNA fragments amplified using 6 ISSR markers were polymorphic. Diversity indices for ISSR markers were ranged from He\\u202f=\\u202f0.2183 to 0.3733, I\\u202f=\\u202f0.3533 to 0.5579, genetic similarity coefficient\\u202f=\\u202f0.5135 to 0.8409 and average PIC value as 0.7523 for each marker. These results indicate the presence of high amount of genetic diversity among studied Impatiens species. Computed p-value (0.941) obtained for Mantel test reveals nonsignificant correlation of the diversity and relationship among Impatiens shown by ISSR markers and morphological characters. Studied Impatiens were divided in to 4 groups based on clustering results in unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) dendrogram of ISSR and morphological data. Resolution of these species obtained using ISSR data limitedly supports the sectional classification. Biogeographic history of Impatiens based on ITS phylogeny using Bayesian Binary Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (BBM) confirmed the South-East Asian origin of Impatiens. This study gave an idea about interspecies diversity in Indian Impatiens and suggests the suitability of ISSR markers for further interspecies diversity studies in Impatiens.Ethnopharmacological relevanceRich accessibility of medicinal plants in the study area provides low cost health care for respiratory disorders to local communities. This first report survey was commenced with an aim to document ethnic knowledge regarding the use of folk herbal medicine for respiratory diseases among the local communities of Gallies Abbottabad, Northern Pakistan using quantitative ethnobotanical approaches.MethodField survey was carried out over the period of 2 years i.e., March 2012–March 2014 in study area. The ethnomedicinal data was collected through interviews among the local communities. Documented data was evaluated using use value (UV) and Relative Frequency Citation (RFC).ResultsA total of 120 species of plants belonging to 90 genera of 51 families were reported to be used ethnomedicinally for the treatment of 25 different respiratory disorders. Leaves were the most commonly used plant parts and most of the herbal medicines were prepared in the form of decoctions and administered orally. The most significant species according to their use value were Solanum virginianum (5.00), Althea officinalis (3.00), Inula obtusifolia (3.00), Saxifraga hirculus (3.00) and Sisymbrium erysimoides (3.00).ConclusionThis study reported traditional herbal medicines for the first time to be used against respiratory disorders in the Gallies, Northern Pakistan are still in common practice by the local communities. Some of the new ethnobotanical claims documented in this investigation should need to be further explore clinically. The medicinal plants with highest use values recorded in this study may signpost the probable existence of valuable phytochemical compounds that requires a search for prospective new drugs to cure many respiratory disorders.Wb14 of Wuchereria bancrofti, an orthologue of Brugia malayi SXP-1 and W. bancrofti SXP-1, was amplified from genomic DNA of W. bancrofti microfilaria collected from four distant geographical locations in India viz., Vellore, Bhubaneshwar, Pondicherry and Sevagram. The gene was sub-cloned in a prokaryotic vector pRSET and expressed in Escherichia coli as a truncated protein (∼23\\xa0kDa). The nucleotide sequence of the gene is 98% similar to that of WbSXP-1 and is found to be intron-less. However, the analysis and comparison of the derived amino acid sequence with WbSXP-1 showed that Wb14 is truncated at amino acid position 153. The distribution of the two genes in the studied four geographical locations indicated that WbSXP-1 is prevalent only in parasite samples from Sevagram while Wb14 is present in parasites from all the other locations. Only a limited polymorphism was observed in both the genes among the parasites from different geographical locations.Metropolitan cities in India are emerging as major economic hubs with an unprecedented land use changes and decline of environmental resources. Globalisation and consequent relaxations of Indian markets to global players has given impetus to rapid urbanisation process. Urbanisation being irreversible and rapid coupled with fast growth of population during the last century, contributed to serious ecological and environmental consequences. This necessitates monitoring and advance visualisation of spatial patterns of landscape dynamics for evolving appropriate management strategies towards sustainable development approaches. This study visualises the growth of Indian mega cities Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai and Coimbatore, through Cellular Automata Markov model considering the influence of agent(s) of urban growth through soft computing techniques. CA Markov model is considered to be one of most effective algorithm to visualise the growth of urban spatial structures. Prediction of growth using agent based modelling considering the spatial patterns of urbanisation during the past four decades has provided insights to the urban dynamics. The industrial, infrastructural, socio-economic factors significantly influence the urban growth compared to the biophysical factors. Visualisation of urban growth suggest agents driven growth in the cities and its surroundings with large land use transformations in urban corridors and upcoming Industrial and ear marked developmental zones. Integrating local agents of urban growth help in identifying specific regions of intense growth, likely challenges and provide opportunities for evolving appropriate management strategies towards sustainable cities during the 21st century.In the last decade the demand of power in India has increased manifold, therefore Government has announced the National Solar Mission of generating 100\\xa0GW of solar power up to 2022. Around 60% of the total National Solar Mission target is allotted to the national/international large-scale solar power developers/investors. Hence, it becomes important to know the ground reality of large-scale solar PV developers/investors. This paper deeply analyzes the key barriers and bottlenecks faced by solar power developers in achieving the target and their growth. This article also suggests some motivational factors of solar energy which play an important role in attracting large solar players around the world to invest in Indian subcontinent. It concludes by highlighting some key policies of the Government that can help in addressing some identified barriers in order to ensure a secured sustainable energy future of India.Kaempferia galanga L. (Zingiberaceae) is an important indigenous medicinal plant of India. Plant rhizomes are used in the preparation of Ayurvedic drugs, perfumes and cosmetics. K. galanga germplasm collected from southern states of India were evaluated for essential oil content and oil composition. The volatile composition of essential oil of Kaempferia galanga L. was investigated by gas chromatography (GC) and Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Results showed wide variations in essential oil content of K. galanga rhizomes ranging from 0.83 to 2.19% on dry weight basis. Thirty-eight compounds were identified in the Kaempferia oil. The oil composition was dominated by two esters viz; ethyl-trans-p-methoxy cinnamate (28.35–69.96%) and trans-ethyl cinnamate (11.48–26.56%). Other prominent chemical constituents were δ-3-carene (0.13–6.46%), 1,8-cineole (0.19–5.17%), borneol (0.96–2.40%) and pentadecane (6.04–16.53%). DIVA-GIS analysis of K. galanga germplasm for chemical components indicated that diverse accessions can be obtained from Central Kerala, while South Eastern parts of Kerala possessed least diversity indices. Superior accessions were identified based on high content of ethyl-trans-p-methoxy cinnamate (IC373589, IC087831, IC373591) and trans-ethyl cinnamate (IC087826, IC210748, IC087832). Ethyl-trans-p-methoxy cinnamate and trans-ethyl cinnamate are found to be the most important constituents present in the essential oil isolated from all the accessions of K. galanga which are reported to be responsible for most of the pharmacological properties of the plant. Hence, these promising accessions of K. galanga can be exploited for large-scale cultivation of this plant for obtaining higher yields of pharmacologically important constituents.Effect of selective logging on vascular epiphyte diversity was investigated in a moist lowland forest of Eastern Himalaya. Three epiphytic groups viz. orchids, pteridophytes and non-orchid angiosperm epiphytes were specifically studied in closed, selectively logged and in unlogged forests with treefall gaps. Logging reduced the structural complexity of the forests and altered their microclimate. With logging, there was a general decline in richness and abundance of epiphytes except orchids. The abundance and species composition of pteridophytes and non-orchid angiosperm epiphytes were related to microclimate and substrate features while their richness were correlated only with canopy cover. In contrast, orchid species composition was related to forest structure. A combination of management strategies is required for conservation of all epiphyte groups. A mosaic of logged and unlogged forest patches with undisturbed forests in proximity would maintain the diversity of pteridophytes and other angiosperms. However, for full representation of orchids, it is necessary to maintain the structural diversity of the tree forms.The present paper deals with Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level, preparing thematic maps for spatial representation of landscape parameters and then validation of the geospatial model using a three-tier approach, viz., landscape analysis, field data extrapolation and geospatial analysis, for two groups of islands in Indian subcontinent. On-screen visual interpretation approach based on IRS LISS-III and Landsat TM data sets was used to delineate the vegetation communities. Field survey attributes on species diversity, economical/medicinal uses and endemism were suitably linked with satellite image-derived landscape attributes in a geospatial domain. The landscape parameters, viz., fragmentation and disturbance index, clearly indicate that Nicobar Islands are less disturbed compared to Andaman. The phytosociological data of different vegetation types collected from 544 stratified sample points was recorded with ground coordinates. The plant communities of Andaman show high plant diversity in terms of number of species (523 species) and more heterogeneity compared to those of Nicobar (347 species). Biological richness was estimated as a function of six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical and ecological) to stratify forest vegetation in two phytogeographically distinct groups of tropical islands, viz., Andaman and Nicobar, using a customized software, SPLAM.Validation of ecological indices had always been a major challenge for ecologist. Here, we discuss a validation technique using field-driven species regression equations for fragmentation (FR), disturbance (DI) and biological richness (BR) indices and propose improvements in the biological richness methodology. The research question of establishment of linkages between expressions of diversity at different scales is sought and thereby validating the existing model outputs has been proposed. The sensitivity of in-field measurements with landscape parameters has been explicitly analyzed. During validation, the species richness, diversity and mean basal area have shown slow decrease with sudden rise in intermediate levels followed by a steep decline at increasing levels of fragmentation and disturbance. The empirically derived regression coefficient has significant correspondence (p\\xa0<\\xa00.05) in terms of community response in both island\\'s groups. The vegetation communities in the forested landscape possess significant linkages with landscape scale processes, viz., FR and DI, as evident by the degree of correlation. The heterogeneity measured as diversity in habit group shows community dimensions in different spatial zones. The generation of baseline data on community ecology allows prioritization of planning process and evolves specific management practices. It may be concluded that the improved biodiversity assessment model and the designed validation techniques have enhanced the reliability of model thus widened the scope for its application in the rapid biodiversity assessment.The aim of the present work is to examine the recent Holocene history of Libyan mammals by integrating data from archaeoozology, prehistoric iconography, historical and recent observations, in order to offer a starting point for future studies. The available data document the past diffusion of species – belonging to both Palaearctic and Afrotropical biogeography – some of which may still survive in some of the more remote desert reaches of this North African state. An additional aim is to compile a bibliographic corpus on Libyan mammals, with particular reference to Italian literature.Understanding the factors that give rise to greater or lesser adaptive capacity among households with in a community could allow government interventions to target the right groups of people. In this paper we study such factors, making use of a household survey administered in the Indian state of Odisha. In the survey, we queried respondents for the adaptations that they had engaged in to deal with the risk of drought, as well as a number of indicators for adaptive capacity taken from the literature. We found a large number of indicators of adaptive capacity to correlate with one or more adaptations taken. However, many of these indicators, while increasing the likelihood that one adaptation would be taken, also decreased the likelihood that another would be taken, and hence were not unambiguous determinants of greater adaptive capacity in general. One indicator, access to crop insurance, stood out as particularly effective: it correlated with an increased likelihood of engaging in two separate yield-raising adaptations, and correlated with a decreased likelihood of engaging in two additional adaptations that would have the effect of reducing yields. The results suggest that further attention to crop insurance may be warranted, as well as further research to determine if the other indicators may be effective in other contextual settings.Ethnopharmacological relevanceSafed musli (Chlorophytum borivilianum) is an eminent medicinal plant of India and considered as a ‘white gold’ or ‘divya aushad’ in Indian systems of medicine. In Ayurveda, Chlorophytum borivilianum belongs to the group of “Vajikaran Rasayana” corroborated to its rejuvenating, aphrodisiac, natural sex tonic properties and effective in alleviating sexual disorders. It is largely used as ethnic medicine by local healers of indigenous communities of India.Materials and methodsA thorough bibliographic investigation was carried out by analyzing worldwide accepted scientific data base (Pub Med, SciFinder, Scopus and Web of Science), thesis, recognized books, non impact and non indexed journals.ResultsTraditionally, Chlorophytum borivilianum is well known for treating male impotency in India. The multi therapeutic and nutritional importance of Chlorophytum borivilianum is attributed to the rich source of phytochemicals particularly saponins. Recently, Chlorophytum borivilianum has gained a well established domestic (Indian) and international market for being the herbal alternative of “Viagra” without any side effects. Under the trade name ‘Nai Chetna’, the state government of Gujarat, India, has launched a novel potency drug from Chlorophytum borivilianum. Modern pharmacological studies of Chlorophytum borivilianum have demonstrated a wide range of pharmacological activities, most importantly aphrodisiac, immunomodulatory and anticancer activities.ConclusionThe increased commercial exploitation of Chlorophytum borivilianum and low productivity of this endangered plant has raised the concern over its conservation. It has been envisaged that efforts should be made to standardize, encourage and popularize the cultivation of Chlorophytum borivilianum as a commercial crop. The analysis of previous pharmacological investigations suggested lack of substantial scientific evidences in various studies and do not stand the test of critical assessment. Due to high economic value, Chlorophytum borivilianum has also encountered a problem of adulteration with closely resembling medicinally inferior species. The studies available on toxicity, safety and quality of Chlorophytum borivilianum are inadequate for providing information on commercial utilization. Thus, the present review summarizes comprehensive information on Chlorophytum borivilianum and possible scope for future research to fill the existing lacunae on its different aspects of the study.The hilly district of Uttara Kannada (13° 55′ N–15° 32′ N Latitude and 74° 5′ E–75° 5′ E Longitude), with an area of 10 200 km2, is one of the most forested tracts of south India, although the total area under forest has been reduced from 80% to 70% over the past century. Excellent documentation of the bird fauna exists from the 1890s and 1980s, with a shorter survey conducted in 1938. An analysis of these three surveys suggests that the size of the total bird fauna has remained constant around 465 ± 20 taxa over this period. However, most of the thirty-one resident bird taxa recorded earlier but not sighted in the recent survey, as well as nine taxa observed only recently, are notable habitat specialists. Only a few of these specialists that have probably been lost over this period are forest birds, the majority being characteristic of the drier cultivation and scrub areas. Recent invaders seem to prefer aquatic ecosystems, and it is suggested that this may be a more general pattern. It is therefore vital that more attention be paid to conservation of the biological diversity of the semi-arid tracts of the Indian subcontinent.There are plans to double the area of strictly protected tropical forest. This article suggests that the siting and management of such reserves are based on models of conservation inappropriate to developing countries, and that an ignorance of past and present tropical land use will prevent reserves achieving their major objective of conserving useful biodiversity. Strict preservation could also destroy the indigenous knowledge needed for ecosystem management. Multipurpose management and continued human use of tropical forests is a more effective and sustainable conservation policy for tropical developing countries. Rural communities should be actively and physically involved in the future productive management of tropical forests, rather than being induced or pressured into abandoning their forest heritage.Bergenia ciliata is a medicinal plant used for the treatment of kidney stones. The presented review is the first attempt to gather utmost information about the distribution, ethno-medicines, phytochemical analysis, pharmacology and toxicology of B. ciliata. This review was designed with the aim to compile fragmented information about B. ciliata in addition to explore its therapeutic potential and future research opportunities. A total of 185 research papers were reviewed using several data sources such as; Web of Science, Scopus, Google scholar, Science direct and PubMed. Results of this review revealed that B. ciliata is being used to cure 104 different types of ailments. Although among reported disorders B. ciliata showed high potential in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders but it is well known for the treatment of kidney disorders particularly kidney stones. Literature review showed that traditional healers mostly utilize it in powder form. Moreover, B. ciliata was reported to possess high antifungal, antiviral, anti plasmodial and antibacterial activities. Pharmacological studies reported that it has good antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tussive, anti-ulcer and anti-neoplastic activities. Variety of secondary metabolites belonging to different classes of compounds such as phenols, alcohols, terpenoids and fatty acid were reportedly isolated from B. ciliata. In spite of having better efficiency of ethno medicines and good pharmacological potential, B. ciliata has also shown toxic effects on living system in several studies. We invite the attention of researchers to carry out detailed ethno-pharmacological and toxicological studies on this valuable plant species in order to provide reliable knowledge to the patients and discover more novel compounds for the development of new drugs with fewer side effects on the living system as compare to modern medicines.Inhabitants of the upper Himalayan regions entertain a belief that the Chir Pine trees are ingressing the Broadleaf forest areas and that these areas are gradually turning into water stressed regions as Chir Pines adversely influence water recharge and water availability. This paper examines whether and to what extent the Chir Pine forest areas are water stressed compared to Broadleaf forest areas by studying the household coping cost in relation to water stress. We use the coping cost differences thereafter to value the relative water provisioning services of forest types. We conduct multiple focus group discussions, a questionnaire survey and statistical analyses to derive the results. Results show all households, except the ones living near Deodar forest, to face water stress in summer but the Chir Pine areas are the most water-stressed. Both comparison of mean and multivariate regressions of water collection time and other coping costs show that the villagers surrounded by Deodar, Deodar mix pine, Broadleaf mix bush or Broadleaf mix pine forests spend much less time for water collection and spend less on water treatment and storage compared to the villagers surrounded by Chir Pine forest irrespective of elevation, aspect or model used. These differences in water collection time amount to a wage income loss between USD 31 and USD 318 in India, and between USD 23 and USD 238 in Nepal per year per household, in Chir Pine areas compared to other forest areas.An efficient micropropagation protocol for high frequency plant regeneration was developed using nodal explants derived in vitro seedlings of Bambusa arundinacea which is an important multipurpose and edible bamboo species and recalcitrant to tissue culture. The nodal explants excised from 20-day-old seedlings were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium fortified with various concentrations of 6-benzyl amino purine (BAP) and kinetin (KIN) (0.5–5.0\\xa0mg/l) alone and/or in combination with 0.5\\xa0mg/l of different auxins [indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)] for shoot bud induction. The combination of BAP (3.0\\xa0mg/l) and IBA (0.5\\xa0mg/l) was found to be the best for the highest percent of shoot bud initiation (87.2%), with 24.2 shoots/explant. The highest frequency (95.2%) of shoot bud multiplication with maximum number of shoots (90.5 shoots/culture) was noticed on medium containing 4% coconut water with 4% sucrose. The regenerated shoot buds were cultured on MS medium supplemented with various concentrations of auxins alone and/or in combination with AgNO3 (0.5–4.0\\xa0mg/l) for in vitro rooting. Maximum percent of rooting (85%) was noticed on MS medium augmented with 3.0\\xa0mg/l IBA and 2.0\\xa0mg/l AgNO3 after 14\\xa0days of culture. Well rooted plantlets obtained were established in the field with 92% survival rate. The present plant regeneration protocol could be used for large scale propagation and ex-situ conservation of this important bamboo species in the near future.A new design framework is introduced for forest structure optimization based on a genetic algorithm landscape encoding and landscape ecology metrics. Landscape ecology is an important interface between the forest management community, which is a traditional user of operations research methods, and the biological conservation community which is relatively new to OR methods and whose goals are increasingly allied with the spatial ecology concepts emerging from landscape ecology. Deforestation and forest fragmentation are increasingly recognized as the underlying drivers of global biodiversity loss, hence forestry management will need to explicitly incorporate spatial ecology objectives.A deforestation model is presented which simulates a landscape progressively fragmenting by the incremental removal of forest patches. Principal components analysis (PCA) of multiple deforestation simulations captures the relative influence of the mean proximity index and the mean nearest neighbour distance, two widely used landscape ecology metrics. An evolutionary programming method based on a genetic encoding of landscape structure is used to optimize forest patch selection by maximizing landscape performance with respect to single and multiple landscape ecology metrics weighted according to the PCA.This optimization approach is envisioned as a key component of a new forestry OR paradigm for designing multi-use landscape systems, incorporating both biodiversity and community needs.Land use and land cover maps can support our understanding of coupled human-environment systems and provide important information for environmental modeling and water resource management. Satellite data are a valuable source for land use and land cover mapping. However, cloud-free or weather independent data are necessary to map cloud-prone regions. This particularly applies to monsoon regions such as the Chennai basin, located in the north of Tamil Nadu and the south of Andhra Pradesh, India, which is influenced by the South Asian Monsoon and has abundant cloud cover, throughout the monsoon season. The Basin is characterized by small-scale agriculture with multiple cropping seasons and the rapidly developing metropolitan area of Chennai. This study aims to generate a land use and land cover map of the Chennai Basin for the cropping season of Rabi 2015/16 and to assess the influence of combining the new ESA Copernicus satellites Sentinel-1 and -2 on classification accuracies. A Random Forest based wrapper approach was applied to select the most relevant radar (Sentinel-1) images for the combination with the optical (Sentinel-2) data. Area proportion weighted accuracy with 95% confidence interval were estimated for the Random Forest models, which differentiated 13 land cover classes. The highest overall accuracy of 91.53% ± 0.89 pp was achieved with a combination of 1 Sentinel-2 and 8 Sentinel-1 scenes. This is an improvement of 5.68 pp over a classification with Sentinel-2 data only. An addition of further Sentinel-1 scenes showed no improvement in overall accuracy. The strongest improvement in class-specific accuracy was achieved for paddy fields. This study shows for the first time how land use and land cover classifications in cloud-prone monsoon regions with small-scale agriculture and multiple cropping patterns can be improved by combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data.Ethnopharmacological relevanceMedicinal plants are treating and preventing a variety disease. There is urgency in recording such data. This is the first ethno botanical study in which statistical calculations about plants are done by ICF method. The present study was aimed to identify plants collected for medicinal purposes by the traditional healers of silent valley, located in Palakad district of Kerala, India and to document the traditional names, preparation and uses of these plants.Materials and methodsField study was carried out a period of 2 years in Kerala. The ethno medicinal information was collected through interviews among traditional healers. The collected data were analyzed through use value (UV) informant consensus factor (Fic) and fidelity level (FL).ResultsA total of 102 species of plants distributed in 95 genera belonging to 53 families were identified as commonly used ethno medicinal plants by traditional healers in silent valley for the treatment of 19 ailment categories based on the body systems treated. Leaves were the most frequently used plant parts and most of the medicines were prepared in the form of paste and administrated orally. Fic values of the present study indicated that dermatological infections/diseases and gastro-intestinal disorders had highest use reports and 7 species of plants has the highest fidelity level of 100%. The most important species according to their use value were Moringa oleifera (2.62), Curculigo orchioides (2.5) Amorphophallus paeoniifolius, Vitex negundo (each 2.37), Carica papaya (2.12), Annona squamosa (1.87).ConclusionGathering the present study, we can recommended the plants Moringa oleifera, Curculigo orchioides, Amorphophallus paeoniifolius, Vitex negundo, Carica papaya, Citrus hystrix, and Tribulus terrestris (with high use values), Amorphophallus paeoniifolius, Aloe vera, Carum capticum and Discorea pentaphylla (newly reported claims with highest FL) for further scientific investigation based upon the traditional knowledge of medicinal plants can be an approach in the discovery and development of novel drug leads.An investigation was carried out to estimate soil respiration rate and its relationship with microbial population in natural tropical forest soil, deforested soil and deforested-and-cultivated soil of Orissa, India. Soil respiration measurements and microbial isolation were performed following standard procedures. Monthly variation of soil respiration was observed to be governed by soil moisture. Considering respiration as a function of microbial population a regression analysis was made. The microfungal population showed positive relationship with the rate of soil respiration. The study revealed that conversion of natural forest led to a reduction of soil microbes and rate of soil respiration. Considering the importance of the microbial component in soil, we conclude that the conversion of natural forests to different land uses leads to the loss of biological stability of the soil.Increasing negative effects of fossil fuel combustion on the environment in addition to limited stock have forced many countries to explore and change to environmentally friendly alternatives that are renewable to sustain the increasing energy demand. Changing to renewable sources and implementation of effective conservation measures would ensure sustainability. Currently, wind energy is one of the fastest developing renewable energy source technologies across the globe. Wind energy is an alternative clean energy source compared to fossil fuel, which pollute the lower layer of the atmosphere. It has the advantage of being harnessed on a local basis for application in rural and remote areas. In order to tap the potential of wind energy sources, there is a need to assess the availability of the resources spatially. Mapping potential sites for tapping wind energy in Karnataka (a federal State in India) is the focus of this study. The study employs the geographical information system (GIS) to map the wind energy resources of Karnataka state and analyse their variability considering spatial and seasonal aspects. Considering these, the present status of the potential is assessed and maps of locations suitable for tapping wind energy have been prepared. A spatial data base with data of wind velocities has been developed and used for evaluation of the theoretical potential through continuous monitoring and mapping of the wind resources. The study shows that the average wind velocity in Karnataka varies from 0.85\\xa0m/s in Bagalkote to 8.28\\xa0m/s in Chikkodi during the monsoon season. Chikkodi, in Belgaum district, has high wind velocity during the period May to September with a peak value of 9.18\\xa0m/s in July. Agroclimatic zone wise analysis shows that the northern dry zone and the central dry zone are ideally suited for harvesting wind energy for regional economic development.t hydropower plant in Karnataka state, India, was set up at Shivanasamudram in 1902. Gradually, the capacities of hydropower plants became very large due to increased electricity demand. Large-scale hydroelectric plants now contribute significantly to meeting the state\\'s and the nation\\'s demand for electricity. Most of Karnataka\\'s hydroelectric plants are located in Uttara Kannada district. Construction of large reservoirs is restricted due to environmental constraints and necessitates the development of ecologically sound alternatives to cater for the needs of the region. The planning of water resources depends on type and size of projects, the ecological factors involved, etc. Emphasis is placed on presenting an overview of water resources through meteorological, hydrological, ecological and economic data. Economic data includes all costs and benefits, specifically hitherto underestimated, environmental social costs and benefits. This study was carried out in Bedthi and Aghnashini rivers in Uttara Kannada district of the Western Ghats region, Karnataka state, India. An estimated 720 and 510 million kWh of electricity can be generated in Bedthi and Aghnashini river basins if all the streams are harnessed. Focusing on land submergence impact, a model is proposed to minimize submergence and maximize net energy in a region, with seasonal power generation, reservoir storage capacity (so as to meet the region\\'s demand during all seasons) and installed generation capacity as the decision variables. Net energy analyses incorporating biomass energy lost in submergence show that maximization in net energy at a site is possible, if the hydroelectric generation capacity is adjusted according to the seasonal variations in the river\\'s water discharge. A decision support system (DSS) used in water resource planning for electricity generation is discussed in this paper.Ethnopharmacological relevanceIndia is having a rich vegetation with a wide variety of plants, because of the extreme variations in geographical and climatic conditions prevailing in the country. Plants have been used since ancient times for the treatment of various ailments. Especially, Kani tribal communities in Thodu hills of Kerala meet their healthcare needs by using non-timber minor forest products and preparations based on traditional knowledge. They still depend on medicinal plants and most of them have a basic knowledge of medicinal plants which are used for first aid remedies, to treat cough, cold, fever, headache, poisonous bites and some simple ailments. The present study was initiated with an aim to identify traditional healers who are practicing herbal medicine among the Kani tribals in Thodu hills of Kerala, India and quantitatively document their indigenous knowledge on the utilization of medicinal plants, particularly most common ethnomedicinal plants.MethodsA field study was carried out over a period of 1 year in Thodu hills. The ethnomedicinal information was collected through interviews among the Kani traditional healers. The collected data were analyzed through use value (UV), informant consensus factor (Fic), fidelity level (FL) and relative importance (RI).ResultsDuring the present study a total of 35 medicinal plant species belonging to 28 families and 34 genera have been documented. These plants were used to treat various diseases and ailments grouped under 14 disease categories, with the highest number of species (7) being used for liver problems, circulatory system and dermatological disorders, followed by skeleto muscular system disorders (6), and fever (5). In the study area the informant consensus about usages of medicinal plants ranges from 0.70 to 1 with an average value of 0.83. Herbs (46%) were the primary source of medicine, followed by shrubs (23%). Plumbago zeylanica (UV of 1.86) and Ocimum tenuiflorum (UV of 1.57) are the most frequently and popularly used medicinal plant species in the study area. Aristolochia tagala is rare and a vulnerable climber, Curculigo orchioides, Elephantopus scaber, Helicteres isora, Smilax zeylanica and Strychnos nux-vomica are rare species which need to be conserved for future use.ConclusionThe high degree of consensus among the informants suggests that the current use and knowledge is still strong. The efficacy and safety of all the reported ethnomedicinal plants needs to be evaluated for phytochemical and pharmacological studies, especially the plants with high informant consensus factor, use value and fidelity level should be given priority to carry out bioassay and toxicity studies. We recommend the plants Plumbago zeylanica, Ocimum tenuiflorum, Artocarpus hirsutus, Andropogon muricatus, Helicteres isora, Coscinium fenestratum and Justicia adhatoda with high UV and RI values. Biophytum sensitivum, Curculigo orchioides, Strychnos nux-vomica, Gossypium hirsutum, Artocarpus heterophyllus, Elephantopus scaber, Pergularia daemia and Pyrrosia heterophylla (newly reported claims with highest FL) for further ethnopharmacological studies for the discovery of potential new drugs.Biodiversity conservation necessitates not only preservation of single or multiple species but also the habitat as a whole along with its environment. Biological richness (BR) is a cumulative property of an ecological habitat and its surrounding environment, which has emerging implications in terms of management and planning. Six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical and ecological) were linked together based on their relative importance to qualitatively stratify biological richness of forest vegetation in Subansiri district of Eastern Himalaya using customized software, Bio_CAP. Higher biological richness was assigned to the habitats with (i) high species diversity, (ii) high degree of ecosystem uniqueness (EU), (iii) high economical value, (iv) complex terrain and (v) low disturbance level. This simple idea of integrated ‘three-tier modeling approach’ of (i) utilization of geospatial tools, (ii) limited field survey and (iii) landscape analysis; formed the basis of rapid assessment of biological richness.Satellite image interpretation using hybrid classification approach provided spatial distribution of vegetation types (corresponding to ecological habitats), with 89% accuracy. Landscape analysis was done using various quantitative indices that measured the heterogeneity and evaluated the patch characteristics. A methodology was developed for deriving relative adjacency weights from field data for calculation of juxtaposition of vegetation types. Biotic disturbance buffers (i.e., proximity zones around roads and human settlements) along with landscape parameters were combined to calculate disturbance index (DI), which in turn became an intermediate surrogate for BR assessment. Species diversity patterns along fragmentation and biotic disturbance gradients were adjudged to derive relative weights for DI computation. Species diversity (Shannon\\'s index), ecosystem uniqueness (endemism status) and biodiversity value (BV) (total importance value (TIV)) were enumerated quantitatively that provided relative weights for BR computation. Terrain complexity (TC) was generated by calculating variance of the elevation image. Fifty-nine of total 764 species were found endemic to Eastern Himalaya with over all species endemism of 13 per ha. Shannon\\'s index increased with decrease in fragmentation levels and increase of distance from sources of disturbance. BR index of the district was presented in five qualitative levels. Subtropical forests claim highest degree of biological richness as well as high disturbance index. This methodology has implications for rapid biodiversity assessment. Forest managers can use the DI and BR maps for gap analysis and prioritization of conservation activities viz., introduction of locale-specific species, thus protecting the forest habitats in situ.Native to Latin America, Mikania micrantha is considered as one of the top invaders in the moist tropical zones of the Pacific and Asian countries, including India. This study was conducted with two specific objectives − first, to examine the niche and biome conservancy of M. micrantha between its native and Indian ranges and second, to understand the potential distribution of this invasive plant in India. Principal Component Analysis of climatic variables associated with known occurrences of M. micrantha in India and native ranges indicated significant shifts in climatic niche of M. micrantha in India. Temperature and precipitation seasonality were found to be the driving factors for the niche shift in India. Our study also revealed that in India M. micrantha invaded a novel biome viz. the temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, which was present but unoccupied in the native range. Given the climatic niche shift, both Indian and native occurrence data were used to model the potential distribution of this weed in India using MaxEnt. The predicted distribution identified that a larger extent of the Indian landmass is climatically suitable for M. micrantha growth. High climatic suitability of some of the urban centers of India adds to the risk of further spread of this plant into ‘still to be invaded’ areas. The niche and biome inconsistencies of M. micrantha in India highlight the need for further investigation of the underlying mechanisms and careful interpretation of its potential distribution.Virulence pathways in gram-negative pathogenic bacteria are regulated by quorum sensing mechanisms, through the production and sensing of N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) signal molecules. Enzymatic degradation to disrupt quorum-sensing in these bacteria could pave the way for the new development in decreasing resistance strains and are of significant interest for clinical, agricultural, and industrial applications. Isolated endophytic Bacillus thuringiensis strain KMCL07 showing quorum quenching activity on Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 has been studied. AiiA lactonase KMMI17 identified belongs to metallo- β-lactamase superfamily preserving conserved regions of 106HXDH-59 amino acids-H169-21 amino acids-D191 motif, significantly inhibits the biofilm formation and attenuates virulence factor pyocyanin production of PAO1. Insilico molecular docking analysis of lactonase KMMI17 using alternative catalytic site (PDB entry: 3DHA) with the AHL-based QS system regulators of PAO-1, C4 AHL, C6 AHL and 3-oxo-C12 AHL molecules showed good binding affinity between the protein and ligands, Phe111 and Tyr198 residues plays an important role in binding them. Crude enzyme extract was found to have Km value for C6-HSL: 134.2702\\u202f±\\u202f34.83\\u202fμM−1, C4-HSL: 308.217\\u202f±\\u202f139.9\\u202fμM−1 and 3-oxo-C12-HSL: 760.463\\u202f±\\u202f251.3\\u202fμM−1. LCMS analysis confirms the degradation activity of lactonase KMMI17 on AHL molecules and its hydrolytic process, which indicates the potential application of lactonase KMMI17 as a biocontrol agent or an anti-pathogenic drug.Ethnopharmacological relevancePteridophytes have been considered an excellent source of medicine since ancient times and remain underexplored in ethnobotanical aspects when compared to other vascular plants. Hence, an attempt has been made to compile medicinally important pteridophytes used by different ethnic minorities and local people in India.Materials and methodsRelevant information on the uses of pteridophytes was extracted from scientific journals (local, regional, and international), books, book chapters, conference proceedings, M.Sc. and Ph.D. dissertations, and other scientific databases. Recent and accepted names of plants were validated using standard nomenclature databases.ResultsIn total, 283 species of pteridophytes are enumerated in this review which are used to treat 129 ailments. Ethnobotanical records from the states Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand revealed 59% of overall uses of pteridophytes from India. Pteridaceae was recorded with highest number of medicinally important species (57), followed by Polypodiaceae, Dryopteridaceae, Thelypteridaceae, and Aspleniaceae with 36, 27, 22, and 21 species respectively.ConclusionsThe use of medicinal plants in the primary healthcare of humans and livestock has been documented since ancient times, and they offer a useful source of new therapeutics. While pteridophytes have considerable importance in traditional pharmacopoeias, scientific studies on pharmacology of this group are scanty. Hence, studies on the phytochemistry and pharmacology of medicinally important pteridophytes with more citations may reveal active principles that can be further developed into novel therapeutic agents. Records of indigenous medicinal knowledge about pteridophytes need to be given top priority to aid the protection of such knowledge before they vanish from present day traditional healers.ObjectiveTo investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum .MethodsPhytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method.ResultsPreliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied.ConclusionsThe findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.Understanding the ecological mechanisms that constrain forest succession in tropical degraded anthropogenic grasslands is a prerequisite for the design of techniques for restoring biodiversity and ecosystem processes. In this context, succession on post-agricultural lands may be arrested by a variety of site-specific biotic and abiotic factors. Here we synthesise our research on the effects of five biotic factors (seed dispersal, development of a soil seed bank, seedling emergence, herbivory, competition) and five abiotic factors (fire, microclimatic conditions, soil nutrients, water availability, disturbance) as constraints to forest succession on degraded anthropogenic grasslands in a tropical lower montane forest landscape in Sri Lanka. The aim of this research was to deduce ecologically and socially acceptable restoration techniques to accelerate forest recovery. Colonisation of grasslands by trees is constrained by limited seed dispersal from adjacent remnant forest patches and their incorporation into grassland soil seed banks. For the few tree seeds that are dispersed into grasslands, a combination of vertebrate herbivory and annual dry season fires reduces the likelihood that they emerge as seedlings. Removal of the grass canopy by clipping or tilling increases the emergence of woody plant seedlings close to the boundaries of forest patches, but has no effect beyond 20\\xa0m into the established grassland. Our research shows that isolation of seedling root systems from those of competing grasses increases the growth and survival of tree seedlings transplanted directly into grassland swards, while above-ground competition and exclusion of vertebrate herbivores has no effects on seedling growth and survival. These experiments identified that the early-successional species Macaranga indica Wight and Symplocos cochinchinensis (Lour.) S. Moore are potential candidates for use in reforestation programmes on abandoned grasslands. We propose a strategy for a model forest restoration programme based on the creation of vegetation islands using early-successional native tree species, the application of a tilling treatment around remnant forest patches, creation of fire breaks around vegetation islands, and the protection of isolated individual trees and tree patches within established grasslands. We highlight the importance of further research on the ecology and biology of seed dispersers and seed predators, and expansion of knowledge on the regeneration traits of native tree species, for future refinements of this restoration strategy.Sensitivity of monsoon rainfall to different ambient wind speeds, orography and wind shear was studied using a two-dimensional mesoscale model. Three numerical experiments were performed with different initial uniform ambient wind speeds (U = 0.1 ms−1, 5 ms−1 and 10 ms−1) for a typical summer day. It was found that the rainfall increased over the mountain slopes as the initial ambient wind increased. As expected, sheared flow produced increased amounts of precipitation as compared to the uniform ambient flow.Effect of sea/land temperature difference on monsoon rainfall was also investigated. Incorporation of diurnal heating caused the surface pressure gradient to increase, leading to local accelerations of winds, increased mesoscale circulations and more rainfall. The model did not predict precipitation when the orography was not considered.The lowland tropical forests of Southeast Asia are dominated by a single family of canopy and emergent trees, the Dipterocarpaceae. The seeds of dipterocarps are gravity or gyration dispersed. Short distance and limited seed dispersal via these mechanisms result in the aggregation of related individuals and strong fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS). In logged and fragmented forests, where gene flow may be disrupted, tree species with strong FSGS are predicted to exhibit increased inbreeding, which consequently can erode genetic diversity, fitness and might limit the potential for natural regeneration of dipterocarps. Developing a set of indirect operational indicators for FSGS provides a solid basis for informing conservation and management of forest genetic resources in logged forests. Our main objective was to use an information theoretic approach to identify these indicators of FSGS in dipterocarps. We quantify FSGS in 19 dipterocarp species across four forest sites in Malaysian Borneo, India and the Seychelles. We detected FSGS in 15 (79%) of our study species, most of which displayed significant inbreeding. Our results suggest that wood density and flower size offer useful indicators of FSGS. We propose some simple guidelines to allow forest managers to account for FSGS when planning approaches to maintain genetically diverse stands in logged dipterocarp forests. The integration of improved understanding of genetic processes is essential for conserving forest tree genetic resources and ensuring the resilience of logged forests.Patchouli (Pogostemon cablin Benth.) is an industrially valued aromatic medicinal plant currently having a huge demand for its essential oil. It is widely used in flavor and fragrance industries as well as in pharmaceuticals. Clonal propagation is therefore obligatory to obtain homogeneous patchouli plants from preferred germplasm in order to meet the global need. At present, farmers are showing keen interest towards its large scale cultivation mainly in the tropical and sub-tropical countries. Understanding the plant biology, chemistry and other uses allows better utilization of any industrial crops. Therefore, the present review discusses on the botany, agronomy and biotechnological aspects of patchouli. Also, the current market demand for patchouli raw material is being reviewed by highlighting the possible exploration of modern techniques in identifying the adulterants to authenticate this herb. This review provides a comprehensive information on both basic and applied aspects of patchouli crop cultivation and management. The applied aspect of patchouli biotechnology allows one to explore the newer potential for various industrial uses and improve the rural economy.An energy resource that is renewed by nature and whose supply is not affected by the rate of consumption is often termed as renewable energy. The need to search for renewable, alternate and non-polluting sources of energy assumes top priority for self-reliance in the regional energy supply. This demands an estimation of available energy resources spatially to evolve better management strategies for ensuring sustainability of resources. The spatial mapping of availability and demand of energy resources would help in the integrated regional energy planning through an appropriate energy supply–demand matching. This paper discusses the application of Geographical Information System (GIS) to map the renewable energy potential talukwise in Karnataka State, India. Taluk is an administrative division in the federal set-up in India to implement developmental programmes like dissemination of biogas, improved stoves, etc. Hence, this paper focuses talukwise mapping of renewable energy (solar, wind, bioenergy and small hydroenergy) potential for Karnataka using GIS. GIS helps in spatial and temporal analyses of the resources and demand and also aids as Decision Support System while implementing location-specific renewable energy technologies.Regions suitable for tapping solar energy are mapped based on global solar radiation data, which provides a picture of the potential. Coastal taluks in Uttara Kannada have higher global solar radiation during summer (6.31\\xa0kWh/m2), monsoon (4.16\\xa0kWh/m2) and winter (5.48\\xa0kWh/m2). Mapping of regions suitable for tapping wind energy has been done based on wind velocity data, and it shows that Chikkodi taluk, Belgaum district, has higher potential during summer (6.06\\xa0m/s), monsoon (8.27\\xa0m/s) and winter (5.19\\xa0m/s). Mysore district has the maximum number of small hydropower plants with a capacity of 36\\xa0MW. Talukwise computation of bioenergy availability from agricultural residue, forest, horticulture, plantation and livestock indicates that Channagiri taluk in Shimoga district yields maximum bioenergy. The bioenergy status analysis shows that Siddapur taluk in Uttara Kannada district has the highest bioenergy status of 2.004 (ratio of bioresource availability and demand).Animals often behave in a profligate fashion and decimate the populations of plants and animals they depend upon. They may, however, evolve prudent behaviour under special conditions, namely when such prudence greatly enhances the success of populations that are not too prone to invasions by profligate individuals. Cultural evolution in human societies can also lead to the adoption of prudent practices under similar conditions. These are more likely to be realized in stable environments in which the human populations tend to grow close to the carrying capacity, when the human groups are closed, and when the technology is stagnant. These conditions probably prevailed in the hunter—gatherer societies of the tropics and subtropics, and led to the adoption of a number of socially imposed restraints on the use of plant and animal resources. Such practices were rationalized in the form of Nature-worship. The Indian caste society became so organized as to fulfill these conditions, and gave rise to two religions, Buddhism and Jainism, which emphasize compassion towards all forms of life. The pastoral nomads of the middle east, on the other hand, lived in an environment which militated against prudence, and these societies gave rise to religions like Christianity, which declared war on nature. As the ruling elite and state have grown in power, they have tried to wrest control of natural resources from the local communities. This has sometimes resulted in conservation and prudent use under guidance from the state, but has often led to conflicts with local populations to the detriment of prudent behaviour. Modern technological progress has also often removed the need for conservation, as when availability of coal permitted the deforestation of England. While modern scientific understanding has led to a better appreciation of the need for prudence, the prevailing social and economic conditions often militate against any implementation of the understanding, as is seen from the history of whaling. However, the imperative for survival of the poor from the Third-World countries may finally bring about conditions in which ecological prudence may once again come to dominate human cultures as it might once have done with stable societies of hunter—gatherers.High population pressure and the rapid pace of human activity including urbanization, industrialization and other economic activities have led to a dwindling supply of arable land per capita as well as water, especially ground water in underdeveloped countries. This has entailed considerable damage to the physical environment, including degradation and depletion of natural resources and unsustainable use of land and water resources. With the impact of climate change, the depletion of water resources will be faster both at the ground as well as the surface level due to rising temperatures in the region. This paper underscores the need for an eclectic approach to policy responses stemming from private and common property rights theories, externality theory and sustainability theory with a view to managing groundwater availability for the poor in terms of equity and sustainability in South Asia, China and Africa.Forest fires constitute one of the most serious environmental problems in several forested regions of India. In the Indian sub-continent, relatively few studies have focused on the assessment of biophysical and anthropogenic controls of forest fires at a landscape scale and the spatial aspects of these relationships. In this study, we used fire count data sets from satellite remote sensing data covering 78 districts over four different states of the Deccan Plateau, India, for assessing the underlying causes of fires. Spatial data for explanatory variables of fires pertaining to topography, vegetation, climate, anthropogenic and accessibility factors have been gathered corresponding with fire presence/absence. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the probability of the presence of fires as a function of the explanatory variables. Results for fire area estimates suggested that, of the total fires covering 47,043km2 that occurred during the year 2000 for the entire Indian region, 29.0% occurred in the Deccan Plateau, with Andhra Pradesh having 13.5%, Karnataka 14.7%, Kerala 0.1%, and Tamilnadu 1.15%. Results from the logistic regression suggest that the strongest influences on the fire occurrences were the amount of forest area, biomass densities, rural population density (PD), average precipitation of the warmest quarter, elevation (ELE) and mean annual temperature (MAT). Among these variables, biomass density (BD) and average precipitation of the warmest quarter had the highest significance, followed by others. These results on the best predictors of forest fires can be used both as a strategic planning tool to address broad scale fire risk concerns, and also as a tactical guide to help forest managers to design fire mitigation measures at the district level.Prevailing dogma asserts that the uplift of Tibet, the onset of the Asian monsoon system and high biodiversity in southern Asia are linked, and that all occurred after 23 million years ago in the Neogene. Here, spanning the last 60 million years of Earth history, the geological, climatological and palaeontological evidence for this linkage is reviewed. The principal conclusions are that: 1) A proto-Tibetan highland existed well before the Neogene and that an Andean type topography with surface elevations of at least 4.5\\xa0km existed at the start of the Eocene, before final closure of the Tethys Ocean that separated India from Eurasia. 2) The Himalaya were formed not at the start of the India–Eurasia collision, but after much of Tibet had achieved its present elevation. The Himalaya built against a pre-existing proto-Tibetan highland and only projected above the average height of the plateau after approximately 15\\xa0Ma. 3) Monsoon climates have existed across southern Asia for the whole of the Cenozoic, and probably for a lot longer, but that they were of the kind generated by seasonal migrations of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone. 4) The projection of the High Himalaya above the Tibetan Plateau at about 15\\xa0Ma coincides with the development of the modern South Asia Monsoon. 5) The East Asia monsoon became established in its present form about the same time as a consequence of topographic changes in northern Tibet and elsewhere in Asia, the loss of moisture sources in the Asian interior and the development of a strong winter Siberian high as global temperatures declined. 6) New radiometric dates of palaeontological finds point to southern Asia\\'s high biodiversity originating in the Paleogene, not the Neogene.Rohitukine, a chromone alkaloid, has gained considerable international attention in recent years because of its novel semi-synthetic derivative, flavopiridol and P-276-00. Both these molecules are in advanced stages of clinical development and trial for cancer treatment. Recently, flavopiridol was approved as an orphan drug for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cancer. The natural occurrence of rohitukine is restricted to only four plant species, Amoora rohituka and Dysoxylum binectariferum (both from the Meliaceae family) and from Schumanniophyton magnificum and Schumanniophyton problematicum (both from the Rubiaceae family). Recently, an endophytic fungi isolated from D. binectariferum was reported to produce rohitukine in culture. In this study, we report the production of rohitukine and its subsequent attenuation by endophytic fungi, Fusarium oxysporum (MTCC-11383), Fusarium oxysporum (MTCC-11384) and Fusarium solani (MTCC-11385), all isolated from D. binectariferum and Gibberella fujikuroi (MTCC-11382) isolated from Amoora rohituka. The fungal rohitukine which was analyzed by HPLC, LC–MS and LC–MS/MS was identical to reference rohitukine and that produced by the plant. The rohitukine content in the mycelial samples ranged from 192.78\\xa0μg to 359.55\\xa0μg\\xa0100\\xa0g−1 of dry weight of and in broth it ranged from 14.10 to 71.90\\xa0μg\\xa0100\\xa0ml−1. In all the fungal cultures, the production declined from first to fourth sub-culture. Studies are underway to unravel the mechanism by which the fungi produce the host metabolite in culture.Camptothecine (Campothecin, CPT), a quinoline alkaloid, is a potent inhibitor of eukaryotic topoisomerase I. Several semi-synthetic derivatives of CPT are in clinical use against ovarian, small lung and refractory ovarian cancers. While CPT is produced by several plant species belonging to the Asterid clade, in recent years, efforts have been made to isolate endophytic fungi from some of these plants as possible alternative sources of CPT. In this study we report the isolation of three endophytic fungi from fruit and seed regions of Miquelia dentata (Icacinaceae), that produce CPT, 9-methoxy CPT (9-MeO-CPT) and 10-hydroxy CPT (10-OH-CPT). All the three fungi identified as, Fomitopsis sp. P. Karst (MTCC 10177), Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissl (MTCC 5477) and Phomposis sp. (Sacc.) produced CPT, 9-MeO-CPT and 10-OH-CPT in mycelial mats in shake flasks containing potato dextrose broth. Methanolic and ethyl acetate extracts of these fungal species were cytotoxic to colon and breast cancer cell lines. We discuss these results in the context of the recent interest in endophytic fungi as possible alternative sources of plant secondary metabolites.A new high-elevation scorpion species of the genus Scorpiops is described from the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. Scorpiops spitiensis sp. nov. is the second highest-elevation scorpion species in Asia and the first one from India occurring at elevations above 4200\\xa0m. The new species closely resembles Scorpiops petersii, but it can be distinguished from it based on a suit of characters, one of which is the presence of 16 trichobothria on the external aspect of the patella, which is unique to the new species.Forest fragments in agricultural landscapes are recognised to provide a variety of ecosystem services, several of which benefit neighbouring agricultural land uses. Pollination of crops is one such service that has attracted much research and public attention, yet the dependency of crops on pollinators, and the role of forest fragments in providing this service, remains contentious. Indeed, the trend towards increasing crop production through intensification is at odds with the expected concurrent decline in pollination. We investigated the combined effect of distance from forest and forest size on pollinator abundance at coffee agro-forests in Kodagu District, India, under two contrasting flowering scenarios: irrigation triggered flowering in a single agro-forest, and rain triggered flowering at all the remaining agro-forests that received rain but were not previously irrigated. Three social bee species, Apis dorsata, Apis cerana and Tetragonula iridipennis were the main flower visitors. In rain-fed agro-forests, the total visitor abundance at coffee flowers decreased with increasing distance to the nearest forest. When the three main pollinators were analysed separately, the abundances of A. dorsata and T. iridipennis decreased with increasing distance from a neighbouring forest patch but this distance effect was reduced with an increase in size of the nearby forest. An increase in pollinator abundance at coffee flowers increased coffee fruit set in rain-fed agro-forests. Irrigated agro-forests had far higher pollinator abundance and fruit set than rain-fed agro-forests. We attribute this to the small-scale staggered flowering of irrigated agro-forests resulting in the concentration of pollinators at these sites regardless of its proximity to forests or the size of nearby forest. Agro-forest shade tree species richness also negatively affected pollinator abundance in rain-fed agro-forests. Although our results show that distance to forest and size of neighbouring forest fragments do affect the abundance of pollinators at coffee, at least in rain-fed agro-forests, justifying the conservation of large forest remnants is problematic on this account as there was no direct effect of forest on coffee fruit set. This is likely to be because there remains a high density of forest remnants within Kodagu, and a threshold of forest cover at which crop fruit set begins to be affected by pollinator scarcity has yet to be reached. By controlling the timing of flowering through irrigation or managing domesticated bee hives, farmers effectively reduce the dependency on nearby forest cover for pollinator services irrespective of the distance between forests and agro-forests, but these management practices incur costs that not every farmer can cover.Increasing demands for non-timber forest products and their commercial extractions can result in harvesting methods that maximize short term economic gains with little attention to long term ecological consequences. We assessed the ecological impacts of harvesting techniques used by an indigenous group, the Soligas, on the non-timber forest products they extract from the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills, south India. Specifically, we examined patterns of resource availability of two non-timber tree species, Phyllanthus emblica and P. indofischeri, and how the current fruit harvesting techniques influence fruit yields, and susceptibility of trees to infestations by hemiparasitic plants of the Loranthaceae family. We also assessed how hemiparasite infestations affect fruit production and growth rates of Phyllanthus trees. There was considerable variation in fruit production in both species of Phyllanthus from one fruiting season to the next. The Soligas harvest an average of 86% (±17.72%) of the fruit yield on a per tree basis in P. emblica and 94.17% (±6.9%) in the case of P. indofischeri. At the population level, 64.75 and 86.6% of the fruit productivity is harvested in P. emblica and P. indofischeri, respectively. However, not all individuals or populations are harvested. Harvesting techniques used resulted in cutting of 15% of P. indofischeri trees and 5% of P. emblica trees. The current harvesting techniques used by the Soligas reduce fruit production in P. emblica in the following year (R2=0.27,p=0.03). Furthermore, the Soligas selectively harvest fruits from trees that have larger fruit crop sizes in both species. Individual trees that carried a greater load of hemiparasites produced significantly lower fruit yields (P. emblica: r=−0.32,p<0.013; P. indofischeri: r=−0.73,p<0.001). The presence of hemiparasites significantly affected the growth rates of trees.Current harvesting techniques used by the Soligas have negative impacts on trees of Phyllanthus spp., as do infestations by hemiparasites. Current fruit harvesting strategies and techniques used by the Soligas focus on maximizing the economic returns by adopting methods of extraction such as lopping of branches and cutting of trees. Such practices can ultimately decrease the rates at which the populations grow, thereby making the extraction of Phyllanthus fruits unsustainable. Adopting more sustainable methods of harvesting appears to be one viable solution to the current ecological problem facing the conservation of Phyllanthus trees in the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills.The long-term probability of soil moisture stress in rainfed crops was mapped at 0.5° resolution over the Krishna River basin in southern India (258,948\\xa0km2). Measurements of actual evapotranspiration (Ea) from 90 lysimeter experiments at four locations in the basin were used to calibrate a non-linear regression model that predicted the combined crop coefficient (KcKs) as a function of the ratio of seasonal precipitation (P) to potential evapotranspiration (Ep). Crops included sorghum, pulses (mung bean, chickpea, soybean, pigeonpea) and oilseeds (safflower and sunflower). Ep was calculated with the Penman–Monteith equation using net radiation derived from two methods: (1) a surface radiation budget calculated from satellite imagery (EpSRB) and (2) empirical equations that use data from meteorological stations (EpGBE). The model of Ks as a function P/Ep was combined with a gridded time series of precipitation (0.5° resolution, 1901–2000) and maps of EpSRB to define the probability distributions of P, P/Ep and Ks for sorghum at each 0.5° cell over the basin. Sorghum, a C4 crop, had higher Ea and Ks values than the C3 plants (oilseeds, pulses) when precipitation was low (P\\xa0<\\xa01\\xa0mm\\xa0d−1) but lower maximum Ea rates (3.3–4.5\\xa0mm\\xa0d−1) compared with C3 crops (oilseeds and pulses, 4.3–4.9\\xa0mm\\xa0d−1). The crop coefficient under adequate soil moisture (Kc) was higher than the FAO-56 crop coefficients by up to 56% for oilseeds and pulses. The seasonal soil moisture coefficient (Ks) for sorghum ranged from 1.0 under high rainfall (July–October) to 0.45 in dry seasons (November–March), showing strong soil moisture controls on Ea. EpSRB calculated at the lysimeter stations was 4–20% lower than EpGBE, with the largest difference in the dry season. Kc derived from EpSRB was only slightly (2–4%) higher than Kc derived from EpSRB, because the maximum Ea occurred during the monsoon when the differences between EpSRB and EpGBE were small. Approximately 20% of the basin area was expected to experience mild or greater soil moisture stress (Ks\\xa0<\\xa00.80) during the monsoon cropping season 1 year in every 2 years, while 70% of the basin experienced mild or greater stress 1 year in 10. The maps of soil moisture stress provide the basis for estimating the probability of drought and the benefits of supplemental irrigation.The community structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in the roots of drought-resistant trees, Moringa spp., was examined in semiarid regions in Madagascar and Uganda. Root samples were collected from 8 individuals of M. hildebrandtii and 2 individuals of M. drouhardii in Madagascar and from 21 individuals of M. oleifera in Uganda. Total DNA was extracted from the root samples, and partial nSSU rDNA of AM fungi was amplified using a universal eukaryotic primer NS31 and an AM fungalspecifi c primer AM1. The PCR products were cloned and divided by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with HinfI and RsaI. Some representatives in each RFLP types were sequenced, and a neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis was conducted for the obtained sequences with analogous sequences of AM fungi. The RFLP and phylogenetic analyses showed that AM fungi closely related to Glomus intraradices or G. sinuosum were detected in many samples. The AM fungal groups frequently detected in the Moringa spp. might be widely distributed species in semiarid environments.Forests with intensive management past are kept unmanaged to restore diversity and ecosystem functioning. Before perpetuating abandonment after protracted restitution, understanding its effect on forest vegetation is desirable. We studied plant diversity and its relation with environmental variables and stand structure in northern Indian unmanaged tropical moist deciduous forest. We hypothesized that post-abandonment species richness would have increased, and the structure of contemporary forest would be heterogeneous. Vegetation structure, composition, and diversity were recorded, in forty 0.1\\xa0ha plots selected randomly in four forest ranges. Three soil samples per 0.1\\xa0ha were assessed for physicochemistry, fine sand, and clay mineralogy. Contemporary forest had less species richness than pre-abandonment reference period. Fourteen species were recorded as either seedling or sapling, suggesting reappearance or immigration. For most species, regeneration was either absent or impaired. Ordination and multiple regression results showed that exchangeable base cations and phosphorous affected maximum tree diversity and structure variables. Significant correlations between soil moisture and temperature, and shrub layer was observed, besides tree layer correspondence with shrub richness, suggesting that dense overstory resulting from abandonment through its effect on soil conditions, is responsible for dense shrub layer. Herb layer diversity was negatively associated with tree layer and shrub overgrowth (i.e. Mallotus spp.). Protracted abandonment may not reinforce species richness and heterogeneity; perhaps result in high tree and shrub density in moist deciduous forests, which can impede immigrating or reappearing plant species establishment. This can be overcome by density/basal area reduction strategies, albeit for both tree and shrub layer.Thrissur, renowned as the cultural capital of Kerala is a city with a strong legacy of cultural, historic and traditional aspects. It is one of its kind in Kerala with a well-planned ring and radial pattern of development. The paper presents an overview of various aspects of the city development such as history, culture, heritage, geography, environment, demography and trade & commerce based on secondary sources. The growth of the city with respect to its development phases and emerging issues are also discussed. General recommendations for improvement of the city are suggested with regard to the current situation.The phrase ‘small is beautiful’ holds true for the micro-hydro plants discussed in this article. Micro-hydro plants can convert the energy of falling water into electricity. In India, access to electricity cannot be taken for granted, especially in rural areas, which do not yet have grid extension or where it is too costly or infeasible. In these cases, micro-hydro plants are a welcome solution. Here I discuss the efforts of two non-governmental organizations, a private company, and a government agency, to facilitate micro-hydro projects in India, thereby increasing the socio-economic empowerment of rural inhabitants without electricity access. Based on extensive ethnographic data and constructivist conceptualizations of scale and consequences I find that these projects can indeed be described as “beautiful” technology interventions. In line with the common discourse on “small is beautiful,” the projects emphasize community engagement, control, and locality. Yet, importantly, they are “beautiful” in diverse ways. The actors set different priorities when implementing their small-scale technology interventions. Highlighting these priorities is important because they can empower people to acquire different roles, ranging from engaged consumers to prosumers. Instead of solely concentrating on the (small) scale of a technology I plead to consider the significance of implementing these interventions.The P-SV- and SH-wave field in the Talchir Basin is simulated along eight profiles: four profiles strike across the basin and the other four along the basin. The hybrid method, which combines two computational techniques, modal summation and finite differences, is used to produce multiphase synthetic seismograms. An M\\xa0=\\xa06 earthquake is considered, with hypocenter along the North Orissa Boundary Fault (NOBF) at a depth of 5\\xa0km and with the focal mechanism parameters: dip\\xa0=\\xa090°, strike\\xa0=\\xa0160° and rake\\xa0=\\xa0180°. The peak acceleration (AMAX) along each profile is determined considering the maximum acceleration obtained at the horizontal components. The response spectra ratio (RSR) as a function of frequency is computed for the eight profiles and the higher amplification is seen to increase in correspondence with the thicker sedimentary cover, especially for the radial component. Higher site amplification for all the profiles is observed in the frequency range from 0.5 to 1.4\\xa0Hz. To validate the obtained site-effects, the sources, for the profiles across the basin, are placed near to the southern end of the profile and the site amplifications are recomputed. Even if the spatial distribution of AMAX is mainly controlled by the epicentral distance, i.e. the geometrical spreading prevails on local soil effects, the RSR shows a pattern that can be easily correlated with the local site conditions. The RSR at the intersection of the profiles is dependent not only upon the local lithology and sediment thickness but also upon the epicentral distance. The Talchir Basin is classified into three zones based on the RSR values: low RSR zone (1.6–1.9), intermediate RSR zone (2.0–2.8) and high RSR zone (2.9–5.2). The PGA estimated for the bedrock model by Bhatia et al. (1999) for the study region is around 0.05 to 0.10\\xa0g while the Indian seismic zonation map estimated it to be in the range from 0.1 to 0.2\\xa0g. In the present study, that considers the effects of lateral variations in the structure, the PGA is estimated to be as high as 0.55\\xa0g along the BA profile.BackgroundKodagu is one of the tiniest districts in the Southern part of Karnataka (India). It is a habitat for more than ten different types of ethnic groups commonly called ‘Girijana’. An ethnomedicinal survey was undertaken in the tribal areas of the district to collect information from the traditional herbal healers on the use of medicinal plants in order to evaluate the potential medicinal uses of local plants used in curing various ailments.MethodsThe information was collected through conducting interviews, discussion and field observation with herbal healers and knowledgeable elder people of the study area using semi-structured questionnaire.ResultsThe survey reveals that the tribal people even today rely on traditional practice-knowledge inherited from generation to generation. It is evident that about 126 plant species belonging to 60 families are being used as ethnic drugs to cure various ailments viz., diabetes (32), skin disorder (22), diarrhoea (6), wound healing (17), intestinal worm (14), antidote for snake bite (13), jaundice (8) etc., respectively.ConclusionRecent trend shows a decline in the number of traditional herbal healers in the tribal areas since the younger generation is not interested to continue this tradition. Hence, there is an urgent need to record and preserve all information on plants used by different ethnic/tribal communities for various purposes before it is completely lost. In addition, several wild medicinal plants are declining in number due to deforestation and forest fires. There is need for phytochemical analysis and pharmacological investigations of these important disappearing plants to strengthen the documentation of ethnic drugs. It would help in developing novel drug(s) to treat chronic diseases.In this study, we explored the potential of multi-temporal IRS Wide Field Sensor (WiFS) data for mapping of vegetation cover types in India. A vegetation cover type map was generated from a hybrid approach (supervised and unsupervised) classification of 8–10\\xa0months IRS WiFS composite data (Raw bands, Max NDVI) over the period of 1998 to 1999. The study has identified 35 cover classes with a description of 22 vegetation cover including 14 forest cover types from 188\\xa0m spatial resolution WiFS data. India has a diverse range of forests: from the tropical evergreen in the south to the alpine meadows in the north, from the deserts in the west to the evergreen forests in the north-east and a diverse pattern of vegetation cover. More than half of the forest area in India is tropical-moist and dry-deciduous types distributed in central part. The WiFS vegetation cover map was compared to the estimates of forest cover area derived from IRS LISS III images (as per Forest Survey of India). There was a good agreement on spatial distribution and area of forest between the WiFS product and the LISS product, however, the WiFS product provided additional information on vegetation cover types and other land use/cover classes. Analysis of temporal NDVI profile allows identification of distinct growth pattern between the different vegetation cover types. It is evident that WiFS data can be used to provide timely and detailed vegetation cover type maps with limited ancillary data. The WiFS derived maps could be very useful as input to biogeochemical models that require timely estimation of forest area and type.To reduce the human influence on natural resources and to identify an appropriate land use, it is essential to carry out scientific land evaluations. Such kind of analysis allows identifying the main limiting factors for the agricultural production and enables decision makers to develop crop managements able to increase the land productivity. Objectives of this study were to develop a GIS based approach for land use suitability assessment which will assist land managers and land use planners to identify areas with physical constraints for a range of nominated land uses. Georeferenced soil survey data and field work observations have been integrated in a GIS based land use suitability assessment for agricultural planning in Chamarajanagar district, Karnataka, India. Also, GIS has been used to match the suitability for main crops based on the requirements of the crops and the quality and characteristics of land. Different land quality parameters, viz. soil texture, depth, erosion, slope, flooding and coarse fragments under various land units were evaluated for the crops. Subsequently all of them were integrated using a sequence of logical operations to generate land suitability and capability maps. Suitability and capability maps for each land use were developed to illustrate these suitability degrees and display the spatial representation of soils suitable for agriculture. It was also found that better land use options could be implemented in different land units as the conventional land evaluation methods suffer from limitation of spatial analysis for the suitability of various crops.Three themes in global mountain geomorphology have been defined and reinforced over the past decade: (a) new ways of measuring, sensing, and analyzing mountain morphology; (b) a new emphasis on disconnectivity in mountain geomorphology; and (c) the emergence of concerns about the increasing influence of anthropogenic disturbance of the mountain geomorphic environment, especially in intertropical mountains where population densities are higher than in any other mountain region. Anthropogenically induced hydroclimate change increases geomorphic hazards and risks but also provides new opportunities for mountain landscape enhancement. Each theme is considered with respect to the distinctiveness of mountain geomorphology and in relation to important advances in research over the past decade. The traditional reliance on the high energy condition to define mountain geomorphology seems less important than the presence of unique mountain landforms and landscapes and the distinctive ways in which human activity and anthropogenically induced hydroclimate change are transforming mountain landscapes.Ethnopharmacological relevanceSymplocos racemosa Roxb. belongs to a unigeneric family Symplocaceae, known as lodhra in Sanskrit; is a small evergreen tree, found throughout the tropical and sub-tropical countries. Ethnobotanical literature indicates use of S. racemosa in treatment of eye disease, skin diseases, ear diseases, liver and bowel complaints, tumors, uterine disorders, spongy and bleeding gums, asthma, fever, snake-bite, gonorrhea and arthritis. The main aim of this review is to provide detailed phytopharmacological profile on S. racemosa in support with the traditional practices and ethnomedicinal uses.Materials and methodsAll relevant worldwide accepted databases have been searched for the name “S. racemosa” along with other literature from Indian Classical texts and Pharmacopoeias. The accessible literatures available on S. racemosa, were collected through electronic search on Pub med, Scopus, Science direct and traditional reports.ResultsS. racemosa is important Indian traditional drug used in many Ayurvedic and herbal formulations for treatment of liver as well as uterine disorders and leucorrhea. Majority of phytopharmacological reports are on stem bark of the plant which include anti-cancer, hepatoprotective, anti-oxidant, anti-androgenic effect, anti-inflammatory, wound healing activity and anti-diabetic effects. Phytochemical studies indicated presence of many phenolic glycosides like symplocoside, triterpenoids like betulinic acid, acetyloleanolic acid and oleanolic acid and flavonoids like quercetin which might have contributed to the observed protective effects.ConclusionMany ethnobotanical claims have been confirmed through systematic in-vitro and in-vivo pharmacological studies on different extracts of stem bark and isolated constituents. However, systematic studies on the bio-markers are desirable to establish mode of action and to validate the traditional claim in clinical practice after proper safety assessment. The conservation data of genus Symplocos showed risk of extinction due to restricted distribution in the wild hence systematic techniques should be developed for the maintenance of this plant.Human agglomerations in the coastal zone bring about unprecedented changes, the impacts of which are on the rise. A clear picture has emerged recently on the deterioration of the highly fragile and sensitive zone of the coastal ecosystem due to overexploitation of living and non-living resources. The formulation of “coastal regulation zones” (CRZ) in this context necessitates the proper management and conservation of these regions by identifying areas that require adequate attention for preservation and development. This paper critically reviews the planning and implementation of CRZ with emphasis on socio-economic aspects as well as traditional practices under Indian conditions. The study also incorporates management strategies for developing countries factually threatened by physical constraints and accelerated ecological changes.Environmental disasters and socio-ecological vulnerability associated with human capacity in any disaster affected region of the world is considered as a key factor in understanding the occurrence of environmental disasters, and consequently, in developing and applying adequate strategies for prevention. The identification of risks and the factors responsible for vulnerability are crucial in analysis and framing strategies for coping and adaptation to the situation. The present paper focuses on identification of potential indicators for disaster risk assessment, socio-economic and cultural vulnerability of local people while striving to cope with shocks of disaster and adaptation and coping strategies of people to mitigate the impact of disaster in Kedarnath valley of Uttarakhand. Based on the long term research and assessment of potential cost-effective bio-resources available locally, this article recommends some of the priority interventions and technology packages for the immediate implementation as well as capacity building of the community to make them economically sustainable and future-ready to respond swiftly towards such catastrophe with less negative impact. Only appropriate strategic framework and their implementation can sustain the human as well as biodiversity in the fragile Himalayan landscape.Estimating Acheulian group sizes based on a fragmentary archaeological record is fraught with difficulties, more so in regions like India, where lithics form the primary source of information. Here, we review current approaches towards modeling group size in Indian archaeology. We then examine to what extent one may address issues related to seasonality, fission-fusion strategies and group size in the context of Acheulian sites, drawing on our research along the southeastern coast of India. We move between multiple scales of analysis: from the regional Acheulian archaeological record to specific studies at the site of Attirampakkam (ATM). We consider aspects of site distribution, sizes, artefact densities and Acheulian lithic reduction strategies, factoring in issues related to geomorphology, taphonomy and chronology. Acheulian hominins occupied the study region over the early to middle Pleistocene, and the fragmented lithic reduction sequence noted on landscape scales suggests diverse site functions structured by ease of access to quartzite raw material for large flake production in addition to other resources. In contrast to most sites, the absence of raw material at ATM necessitated groups to anticipate this, and organize their behavior on landscape scales, and on-site, to resolve this issue. We show how successive groups were attracted to the site over the early Pleistocene, potentially aiming at exploiting seasonally predictable biological resources in a riparian environment, knowledge of which was transmitted across generations. Considerations of the spatial and temporal variability in artefact densities across a vast site area, along with aspects of the lithic reduction sequences suggests a short-duration occupation by a potentially large group, possibly resulting from aggregation of several small groups as noted in some ethnographic examples of hunter-gatherer fission-fusion strategies. We show drastic changes in behavioral organization in the succeeding Middle Palaeolithic phases at the site and in the region.Methods of calculating wildlife entanglement rates are not standardised between studies and often ignore the influence of observer effort, confounding comparisons. From 1997–2013 we identified 359 entangled Australian fur seals at Seal Rocks, south-eastern Australia. Most entanglement materials originated from commercial fisheries; most frequently entangling pups and juveniles. Using Generalized Additive Mixed Models, which incorporated observer effort and survey frequency, we identified that entanglements were observed more frequently amongst pups from July to October as they approached weaning. Neither the decline in regional fishing intensity nor changing seal population size influenced the incidence of entanglements. Using the models, we estimated that 302 (95% CI\\xa0=\\xa0182–510) entangled seals were at Seal Rocks each year, equivalent to 1.0% (CI\\xa0=\\xa00.6–1.7%) of the site population. This study highlights the influence of observer effort and the value of long-term datasets for determining the drivers of marine debris entanglements.ObjectiveTo assess antifungal activity of Ocimum sanctum leaves against dermatophytic fungi.MethodsAntifungal activity of Ocimum sanctum leaves was measured by 38 A NCCLS method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of various extracts and fractions of Ocimum sanctum leaves were also determined.ResultsOcimum sanctum leaves possessed antifungal activity against clinically isolated dermatophytes at the concentration of 200 μg/mL. MIC and MFC were high with water fraction (200 μg/mL) against dermatophytic fungi used.ConclusionsOcimum sanctum has antifungal activity, and the leaf extracts may be a useful source for dermatophytic infections.Tropical Asian Galliformes are secretive and difficult to survey. Many of these species are considered “at risk” due to habitat degradation although reliable density estimates are lacking. Using camera trapping and distance sampling data collected on the Siamese Fireback (Lophura diardi) in northeastern Thailand, we compared density estimates for pristine and degraded lowland forest. Density was poorly estimated using distance sampling, likely due to small sample size arising from poor visibility in dense vegetation and bird’s sensitivity to observers. We analysed camera trap data using both count-based and presence/absence-based methods. Those density estimates had narrower confidence intervals than those obtained using distance sampling. Estimated density was higher in dry evergreen forest (5.6\\xa0birds\\xa0km−2), than in old forest plantations (0.2\\xa0birds\\xa0km−2), perhaps because dense forest habitats provide Firebacks with more resources and refuge from predation. Our results suggest that camera trap data can be used for estimating density of cryptic terrestrial bird species inhabiting tropical forest that lack unique identification markings. However, this technique requires that the effective sampling area is known and thus requires knowledge of the animal home range size.We assessed variation in avifaunal diversity at some selected habitats around the Negombo estuary in Sri Lanka in relation to land-use modifications. During the study period, we observed 48 bird species of which 47 species are residents to Sri Lanka. The avian species richness, evenness, and heterogeneity were found to be the highest at undisturbed habitats. Further, these diversity measures were negatively correlated with the intensity of anthropogenic land-use activities. Total abundance of birds increased at highly disturbed habitats due to the presence of the house crow, as it is the most abundant of all birds observed at these habitats. This study highlights the need for habitat management around estuaries, giving due consideration to existing ecological theories to conserve avifaunal diversity. It also highlights the negative impacts of the house crow on diversity of other resident avian fauna in these habitats.Forest fragmentation is continued to be widespread in the tropics resulting in reduced ecosystem services including carbon storage. However, the effect of forest fragmentation is not considered in the current carbon policy. We investigated the effect of forest fragmentation on tree biomass carbon and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in a moist tropical forest in Bangladesh. Above and below-ground tree biomass carbon were calculated by using widely accepted allometric equations and SOC was measured by sampling soils up to 10\\xa0cm depth and analyzing them in a soil laboratory. Results showed that carbon storage in tree biomass was significantly lower in fragmented forests (16.3\\xa0±\\xa01.37\\xa0t\\xa0C\\xa0ha−1) than in contiguous forests (31.21\\xa0±\\xa02.75\\xa0t\\xa0C\\xa0ha−1) (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). Likewise, a significantly lower SOC was contained in the soils of fragmented forests (17.26\\xa0±\\xa00.83\\xa0t\\xa0C\\xa0ha−1) than in contiguous forests (21.62\\xa0±\\xa00.78\\xa0t\\xa0C\\xa0ha−1) (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). Thus a total of 36% less carbon retained in tree biomass and soils in fragmented forests than in contiguous forests. Backward multiple linear regression analysis revealed tree density, tree height, tree DBH, height-diameter ratio (H/D) and tree species richness as influential factors of carbon variation in fragmented forests. All these structural parameters except tree species richness were significantly lower in fragmented forests, were positively associated with carbon storage and explained together 69% of the carbon storage variation. These findings suggest that the altered stand structure and tree allometry likely caused reduced carbon storage in fragmented forests and highlight the importance of landscape scale management intervention in the tropics. Here, we provided with the evidence of strong negative impact of forest fragmentation on carbon storage and argue that this effect should be in consideration which is currently overlooked in existing carbon accounting systems for tropical forests.A study has been made of the population ecology of large mammals of Silent Valley and contiguous forests of South India. The vegetation of Silent Valley and Attapadi forests are mostly west coast tropical evergreen and semi-evergreen types. In the adjoining forests Nilambur and Nilgiris, the vegetation is southern secondary moist mixed deciduous and southern montane wet temperature, respectively. Silent Valley and its contiguous forests harbour 25 species of large and medium-sized mammals, including two endangered endemic species and many others that are endangered and protected. The lion-tailed macaque, Nilgiri tahr and tiger were sighted in and around the submergence area of the proposed Silent Valley hydroelectric project. If constructed, the impact of this dam on the populations of larger mammals in the area would be severe.ng evidence highlights the role that botanic gardens might have in plant invasions across the globe. Botanic gardens, often in global biodiversity hotspots, have been implicated in the early cultivation and/or introduction of most environmental weeds listed by IUCN as among the worst invasive species worldwide. Furthermore, most of the popular ornamental species in living collections around the globe have records as alien weeds. Voluntary codes of conduct to prevent the dissemination of invasive plants from botanic gardens have had limited uptake, with few risk assessments undertaken of individual living collections. A stronger global networking of botanic gardens to tackle biological invasions involving public outreach, information sharing and capacity building is a priority to prevent the problems of the past occurring in the future.Whereas in all other vertebrates the Müllerian ducts of genetic males are aborted during development, under the influence of Müllerian-inhibiting substance, in the caecilian amphibians they are retained as a pair of functional glands. It has long been speculated that the Müllerian gland might be the male accessory reproductive gland but there has been no direct evidence to this effect. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the caecilian Müllerian gland secretory proteins would bear antigenic similarity to secretory proteins of the prostate gland and/or the seminal vesicles of a mammal. The secretory proteins of the Müllerian gland of Ichthyophis tricolor were evaluated for cross-reactivity with antisera raised against rat ventral prostate and seminal vesicle secretory proteins, adopting SDS-PAGE, two-dimensional electrophoresis and immunoblot techniques. Indeed there was a cross-reaction of five Müllerian gland secretory protein fractions with prostatic protein antiserum and of three with seminal vesicle protein antiserum. A potential homology exists because in mammals the middle group of the prostate primordia is derived from a diverticulum of the Müllerian duct. Thus this study, by providing evidence for expression of prostatic and seminal vesicle proteins in the Müllerian gland, substantiates the point that in caecilians the Müllerian glands are the male accessory reproductive glands.Biodiesel from non-edible vegetable oil seems to be a promising alternate for petro-diesel in the present energy scenario. This study analyses the experimental and theoretical effects on the blends of Bee Wax biodiesel with straight diesel on combustion parameters. A zero-dimensional mathematical model is developed to analyse the rise in in-cylinder pressure along with Wiebie’s heat release correlations, ignition delay, gas dynamics model, heat transfer model and frictional model. The combustion parameters include in-cylinder pressure rise, net heat release and rate of pressure rise are investigated and found to be higher for straight diesel and deteriorated with the increase in blends of BWB. The theoretical simulation also supports the experimental data with constant injection timing, speed and compression ratio.The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial, anti-oxidant and anthelmintic potential of extracts of the herb Solanum xanthocarpum. The antimicrobial activity was tested against selected bacterial and fungal species by agar well diffusion method and the antioxidant activity was assessed using FRAP and reducing power scavenging assays. While that of anthelmintic activity was performed against the erthworms. The FRAP assay evaluates the ability of a substance to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+. Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed the presence of saponins; phytosterols and carbohydrates in the plant.India’s growing population and economy generate an increasing demand for energy. Facing the decline of global fossil fuel resources, the Indian government and energy industry are considering the long-term expansion of biofuel production in order to increase energy security. This development leads to a strong competition of energy crops versus food crops for land and may result in an increasing pressure on natural resources. In a pilot scenario study, the LandSHIFT model is applied to assess the impact of biofuel production on land-use change in India up to the year 2030. The model aims at the spatially explicit simulation of land-use change and its relation to other global change processes on the national up to the global scale. It explicitly addresses competition between land-use activities such as human settlement, biofuel production and food production as well as the resulting effects on the spatial extent of natural land. Baseline of the study is a simulation with drivers from the “Order from Strength” scenario of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. To illustrate the consequences of expanded biofuel production for the extent of natural land, we calculate three scenarios of bioethanol production to substitute 5%, 10% and 20% of the expected petrol demand in 2030. In the simulations shown, a comprehensive linkage is made between driving forces (such as population change) and policies (such as biofuel usage) that will affect land-use change over the coming decades.The goal of this study was to test whether body-mass based foraging principles, guided by plant available moisture (PAM) and plant available nutrients (PAN), could explain large mammalian herbivore species distribution and richness in India. We tested (1) whether the occurrence of larger-bodied herbivore species increases with PAM, but is independent of PAN, (2) whether the occurrence of smaller-bodied herbivore species decreases with PAM, but increases with PAN, and (3) whether herbivore species richness is highest in areas with intermediate PAM and high PAN. We analyzed the distribution and richness of the 16 large (>10\\xa0kg) herbivore species found in sub-Himalayan mainland India. Since the distributions of large herbivores in India have been altered by historic human activity, we only used India\\'s largest 76 protected areas as data points, with respect to PAM (log10(rainfall/potential evapotranspiration)), PAN (soil cation exchange capacity), elevation, tree cover, and fire frequency. Using regression and null models to analyze the data, we found positive relations between PAM and the occurrences of the larger-bodied species (elephant and gaur), and negative relations between PAM and the occurrences of smaller-bodied species (chinkara, four-horned antelope and blackbuck). We also found positive relations between the occurrence of the smaller-bodied species and PAN. Large herbivore species richness in India is highest in Kanha and Indravati, areas with high PAN and intermediate PAM. We found that elevation, tree cover and fire frequency were insignificant predictors of herbivore species richness, although elevation and tree cover explained the distribution of a few species. Based on our null model analyses results, we conclude that moisture and soil nutrients are important in determining large herbivore species distribution and richness in sub-Himalayan India.Upland grasslands in South Africa occur in climates warm enough and wet enough for forests yet, unlike savannas, trees are absent. We hypothesize that the lack of trees in grasslands is due to the scarcity of gaps suitable for tree seedling establishment in the grass root layer. We assessed which demographic bottlenecks, seedling recruitment or sapling release, were limiting large tree populations of Acacia species in 229 sites on a gradient from lowland savannas to upland grasslands in eastern South Africa. We explored the frequency of ‘root gaps’ by quantifying grass root biomass in grids of 18 points at six sites distributed from lowland savannas to upland grasslands.Across the altitudinal gradient, sapling release was the most common bottleneck at low elevation sites switching to seedling recruitment in upland savannas and adjacent grasslands. Root studies showed grass root biomass at upland sites to be double than that of lowland sites. When grass root biomass of all 108 sample points was ranked, lowland savanna sites had the most frequent ‘gaps’ defined as the lowest percentiles of values (5, 15, 25, 35, 45). The number of ‘gaps’ decreased along the elevation gradient with none in the grassland site. Dense grass roots may prevent seedling establishment and ‘root gaps’ may be safe sites with reduced competition where seedlings can establish. We suggest that a lack of root gaps could explain the treeless nature of many upland grasslands.The search for diverse plant growth-promoting diazotrophic bacteria is gaining momentum as efforts are made to exploit them as bioinoculants for various crops. In particular, the use of strains with multiple plant growth promoting properties would help to increase crop productivity on a sustainable basis. This study investigated the effects of plant growth promoting potential of diazotrophs isolated from rhizosphere of semi-arid tropical grasses and evaluated their inoculation effects on the growth of rice plants under in vitro and in vivo conditions. The diazotrophic isolates from grass species were characterized for nitrogenase activity by acetylene reduction assay (ARA) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The ARA activity of the isolates ranged from 50.83 to 172.25\\xa0nmol\\xa0ethylene/mg\\xa0protein/h and the putative diazotrophs from rhizosphere of grass species were identified by nifH gene amplification. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis identified the isolates as belonging to class of alpha Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Plant growth promoting traits of all the selected diazotrophic isolates were analysed and results revealed that the diazotrophs were found to produce phytohormone, siderophores, HCN, solubilized minerals such as P, K and Zn. Diazotrophs also produced enzyme such as ACC deaminase that can modulate plant growth and development. Based on the presence of multiple plant growth promoting traits, the isolates were selected for inoculation studies. In gnotobiotic experiment, inoculation of diazotrophic isolates significantly improves the growth of rice. In the field experiment, Serratia sp. (CB2) and K. pneumoniae (CR3) treated plots, grain yields were recorded more by 31 and 28%, respectively, over yield obtained using full doses of fertilizers. This trait of improving growth parameters and yield of rice indicates that the diazotrophs isolated from grass species can be utilized as bioinoculant for rice.The proposed Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC) is an ambitious effort to stem the erosion of biodiversity in one of the world\\'s biologically richest regions. The intent is to connect large existing parks and reserves with new protected areas by means of an extensive network of biological corridors within Mesoamerica/Central America to create an environment which provides better prospects for the long-term survival of native species while also addressing the region\\'s socioeconomic needs. While the forest types in northern Central America generally receive some dry season rainfall, in the proposed protected regions, however, it is unclear whether current rainfall has been altered by regional land-use change.Based upon climatological rainfall records at 266 stations in Guatemala and adjacent areas, dry season rainfall in March is markedly lower in deforested areas than in forested areas of the same life zone for each of the widespread life zones. In general, dry season deforested habitats have higher daytime temperatures, are less cloudy, have lower estimated soil moisture and lower values of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) than do forested habitats in the same life zone. The result is hotter and drier air over deforested regions, with lower values of cloud formation and precipitation. Rainfall is predicted from the correlation of raingauge measurements and observed cloud cover; moreover, March rainfall deficiencies >\\xa025\\xa0mm are found for several Holdridge life zones. The data suggest that deforestation is locally intensifying the dry season, increasing the risk of fire, especially for the long corridor connecting regions. In addition, forest regeneration in some parts of the MBC may not result in second-growth forest that is characteristic of that life zone but rather in forest regeneration more typical of drier conditions. The extent to which this would influence the conservation utility of any given corridor depends upon the ecological requirements of the organisms concerned.Logging is one of the most pervasive threats to biodiversity in tropical forests. In this study, we concurrently examined the responses of the avian frugivore community and the community of fruiting trees to past logging in a tropical forest in northeastern India. We predicted that the abundance of, and visitation by large-bodied frugivores would be lower in logged forests, resulting in reduced seed dispersal and recruitment of biotically dispersed species (especially large-seeded species). Data were collected from two logged and unlogged sites using (a) belt transects for estimating avian frugivore abundance (b) fruiting tree watches to quantify frugivore visitation and (c) vegetation plots to characterize recruitment. Our results show that differences in the abundance of bird species between logged and unlogged sites was correlated with body mass, with larger species being scarcer and smaller species more abundant in logged areas. Correspondingly, visitation rates by large avian frugivores was lower in logged compared with unlogged sites. Finally, biotically dispersed tree species, especially large-seeded species, had lower recruitment in logged forests, potentially due to lowered visitation rates and decreased fruit removal by large bodied avian frugivores. In the long term, these differences in recruitment may result in a tree community shift towards small-seeded biotically dispersed species and abiotically dispersed species in logged areas.The market for ornamental plants is growing every year, becoming an important part of the economy. Every year hundreds of new cultivars, replacing the current assortment, are produced. However, since consumer preferences are changing rapidly, the cultivars considered old-fashioned today may become popular once again. They are also a valuable breeding material source. Bearing that in mind, there is a great need to develop a strategy for their long-term conservation. Storage in gene banks under in vitro cultures, although offering many advantages, is expensive and threatened with somaclonal variation and contamination loss. Cryopreservation is believed to be a more promising method. It has been successfully used with many agricultural species. Unlike micropropagation, cryopreservation has not yet found wider employment with ornamental plants. The upcoming years and progress in cryobiology may, however, change this situation and broaden the potential of cryoconservation. Over years several freezing methods have been introduced. The first one developed, based on slow cooling, had limited usefulness in temperate species. Today the encapsulation-dehydration technique is most often used with ornamental plants. In the future, however, combined techniques will probably be the most popular. So far insufficient attention has been paid to the problem of the genetic stability of cryopreserved ornamental species, especially chimeras. The aim of this paper is to present different cryopreservation techniques and their use for the storage, protection and breeding of ornamental plants.In the rare perennial bodies of water of the Sahara desert, only a few fish species have survived to increasing aridification since the end of the last humid period at the Holocene, approximately 5000 years BP. Here, I report the occurrence of an undescribed haplochomine cichlid fish in Lake Boukou, one of the seven Ounianga Serir lakes (Chad). These lakes are located in one of the most arid areas of the Sahara desert, but they persist by virtue of subsurface inflow of fresh groundwater from a large fossil aquifer. Astatotilapia tchadensis sp. nov. is characterized by a black bar between eye and corner of mouth, rounded orange spots on anal fin, scales ctenoid, lower limb of first gill arch with 7–8 gill rackers, dorsal fin with 13–14 spines and 9–11 soft rays, anal fin with 3 spines and 8–9 soft rays, 29 or 30 lateral line scales, and lower pharyngeal dentition with enlarged molariform teeth. The new species is easily distinguished from A.\\xa0desfontainii and A.\\xa0flaviijosephii, the northernmost haplochromine species currently isolated from its other group members, and appears close to an unnamed species of Lake Chad basin. Ounianga Serir lakes and especially Lake Boukou present a remarkable diversity of fish, the highest known in the Sahara desert with a total of at least six fish species belonging to six genera and three families. They also constitute an exceptional natural landscape inscribed on the UNESCO world heritage list in 2012 and a biodiversity hotspot for desert vertebrate species.The present study develops the highly reliable and reproducible protocol for indirect organogenesis of Helicteres isora L., a medicinally important multipurpose plant of Sterculiaceae family. Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different plant growth regulators induced callus with different type and texture. The combination of 10.74\\xa0μM naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and 5.71\\xa0μM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) fortified with MS medium resulted best response (100%) in callus induction with fresh weight from leaf (3.75\\xa0±\\xa00.11\\xa0g) and internodal (3.30\\xa0±\\xa00.14\\xa0g) explants. Green compact nodular callus (GCNC) was transferred to shoot regeneration medium for shoot regeneration. The multiplication rate of adventitious shoots was influenced by various factors like explant type, media composition, plant growth regulator combinations and concentrations. MS medium supplemented with 2.69\\xa0μM NAA, 0.57\\xa0μM IAA and 4.92\\xa0μM\\xa0N6-(2-isopentenyl) adenine (2ip) combination resulted in 80.95\\xa0±\\xa04.76 percentage of response with 8.43\\xa0±\\xa00.43 number of shoots per piece of callus derived from leaf explant. This combination was expressed 76.19\\xa0±\\xa04.76 percentage of response with 7.28\\xa0±\\xa00.28 number of shoots per internode-derived callus respectively. The addition of 50 mg l−\\xa01 glutamine in 2.69\\xa0μM NAA, 0.57\\xa0μM IAA and 4.92\\xa0μM 2iP combination enhanced the shooting frequency with 12.14\\xa0±\\xa00.83 and 9.14\\xa0±\\xa00.51 shoots from leaf and internodal explant-derived callus. Elongated shoots [4.92\\xa0μM 2iP and 1.44\\xa0μM of gibberellic acid (GA3)] were achieved rooting in half-strength MS medium fortified with 4.90\\xa0μM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) with 582.84\\xa0μM activated charcoal. The genetic fidelity between mother plant and in vitro plants was assessed through SCoT and ISSR marker systems. Both these analysis revealed that all the samples were found monomorphic in nature. This suggests that the current study standardised the true-to-type culturing protocol and authenticated the in vitro raised plantlets are remain free from somaclonal variations.Ethnopharmacological relevanceInspite of tremendous advances made in allopathic medical practices, medicinal plants have played an important role throughout the world in treating and preventing a variety of diseases and hence there is urgency in recording such data. This is the first ethnobotanical study in which statistical calculations about plants are done by the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) method. The present study was aimed to identify plants collected for medicinal purposes by the traditional healers of Nelliyampathy hills, located in Palakkad district of Kerala, India and to document the traditional names, preparation and uses of these plants.MethodsThe field study was carried out over a period of 2 years (2011–2013) using semi-structured interviews with 66 informants (most of the informants belonged to an age between 50 and 70 years) in six remote locations in the hills. Ethnomedicinal data was analyzed using frequency citation (FC), relative frequency of citation (RFC) and use value (UV) along with a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Demographic characteristics of participants, ethnobotanical inventory of plants and data on medicinal application and administration were recorded.ResultsA total of 85 medicinal plants belonging to 49 families were reported to be used against 19 different ailments in the hills. The maximum reported medicinal plant families were Cucurbitaceae with 6 species followed by Acanthaceae, Malvaceae and Fabaceae (each 5 species), Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, Moraceae and Myrtaceae (each 3 species), the most dominant life form of the species includes herbs (42) followed by tree (20), climber (15) and shrub (8), the most frequent used part was leaves (40%) followed by root (14%), seed and flowers (each12%), fruit (9%), bark (7%), stem (2%), latex (2%), rhizome and whole plant (each 1%), the most common preparation and administration methods were paste (32%), powder (22%), decoction and juice (each 20%) and raw (4%), infusion and inhalation (each1% ). The Pearson correlation coefficient between RFC and UV was 0.638 showing highly positive significant association.ConclusionsIn this study, we have documented considerable indigenous knowledge about the native medicinal plants in Nelliyampathy hills for treating common ailments. The plants such as further investigated phytochemically and pharmacologically which leads to natural drug discovery development may be based on the present study. The study has various socioeconomic dimensions which are associated with the local communities.ObjectiveThe present study highlights the ethno medicinal of Irulars in the Redhills of Tamil Nadu. They have continuously being used till in this modern drug process. They have the capability to search for number of uses of plants.MethodsExtensive field surveys were conducted in the two Irulars villages involving 10 households. The information on medicinal plants and their utilization was collected through personal interview.ResultsA total of 35 species affiliated to 27 families have been documented.DiscussionThe present study observed that, the Irular tribe of the red hills having very good knowledge on the traditional medicine.ConclusionThis type of studies may help pharmacological research in various dimensions.Spiranthes (∼36 species, Orchidaceae) is a small genus with a global distribution. It has a center of diversity in North America with only a few species occurring in Asia. This study focuses on the Asian Spiranthes with an emphasis on understanding their biogeographic relationships and species delimitations using molecular markers. Our phylogenetic trees based on nuclear (ITS) and chloroplast (trnL-trnLF, matK and trnS-G) sequences from samples across their range in Asia revealed the Asian Spiranthes are monophyletic. Ancestral area optimization suggested that North America forms the ancestral region for the Asian Spiranthes rather than Europe suggesting that they originated from a single long-distance dispersal event. Our study also revealed the presence of a cryptic species S. himalayensis, which was discovered based on molecular data thus emphasizing the importance of wide geographical sampling in phylogenetic studies. Sequences of cloned ITS provided support for the hypothesis that natural hybridization between S. sinensis and the newly described S. himalayensis resulted in the allotetraploid S. hongkongensis, with S. himalayensis as the paternal parent. One of the species complexes known in Asia is the S. sinensis complex, which shows a wide occurrence and is known for local geographical variants. Some of these variants have been described as new species in Australia and New Zealand. Our studies show that all the sampled variants including the Australian and New Zealand species show monophyly despite having long branches. This suggests that there may be high rates of gene flow between the geographically distinct forms resulting in lack of species resolution within the S. sinensis complex.Indian tropical deciduous forest due to higher species richness, irregular stem densities and stem cover, multistoried canopy and microclimate, offers dynamism to the understanding of the spatial patters in aboveground biomass (AGB) and carbon (AGBC) within different plant functional types (PFTs). Field-based AGB and AGBC estimates are vital for carbon cycle study and provide inputs for data-deficit regional and global carbon and climate models.In this paper we generated the primary baseline data on tree composition, species richness (SR), AGB and AGBC gathered from nine 10,000\\xa0m2 long-term ecological research (LTER) plots in three distinct PFTs {dry mixed (DM), sal mixed (SM) and teak plantation (TP)} within an Indian tropical deciduous forest along Himalayan foothills during 2009–2012. The functional relationship of PFT structural attributes i.e. SR, density, basal cover, leaf area index and litter fall on AGB was investigated. PCA was applied to study the relationship between PFT microclimate, structural attributes and diversity vs. AGB.A total of 22, 22 and 6 tree species were found in DM, SM and TP PFT, respectively. Shannon\\'s diversity index was highest (2.46) in DM, whereas Simpson\\'s dominance index was maximum (0.85) in TP. AGB (Mg\\xa0ha−1) ranged from 290.82–455.99 among all PFTs. AGBC (Mg\\xa0ha−1) ranged between 207.52–220.34, 215.58–228.87, and 125.94–141.18 in DM, SM and TP respectively. AGB observed strong positive correlation with tree density and cover. PCA revealed humidity and air temperature as the major microclimatic variables, leading to higher AGB.Groundwater is a vital resource in arid and semi-arid regions, increasingly relied upon for year-round access, though lack of both study and regulation contribute to unsustainable pressures potentially contributing to a negative spiral of ecological, social and economic decline. Using field visits, interviews with locals and experts, and literature reviews, we explored a successful programme of community-based groundwater recharge in three adjacent catchments (the Arvari, Sarsa and Baghani) in semi-arid north Rajasthan, India, led by the NGO Tarun Bharat Sangh (TBS) in order to determine how successes were achieved and could be replicated. TBS-led initiatives rebuilt traditional village governance structures and participation in community-designed and maintained water harvesting structures (WHSs), which were efficient both economically and in technical design using indigenous knowledge. Enhanced seasonal groundwater recharge enabled by WHSs regenerated aquatic, farmed and natural ecosystems, underpinning a positive cycle of interdependent social and economic regeneration. Locally appropriate, integrated social and technical solutions maintaining this positive cycle have increased the quality of ecosystems and the wellbeing of local people. We used the STEEP (Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political) framework to stratify outcomes, exploring principles underpinning successful local and catchment-scale regeneration and drawing out lessons transferrable to similarly water-stressed regions.ObjectiveTo determine the minerals, Iron (Fe), Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Manganese (Mn) and trace elements, Lead (Pb), Copper (Cu), Cadmium (Cd) and Zinc (Zn) in two tropical medicinal plants (Syzygium caryophyllatum and Syzygium densiflorum).MethodsAll the elements were determined by using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS).ResultsThe average concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Pb and Cd detected in leaves of Syzygium caryophyllatum and Syzygium densiflorum were 99.275±0.022, 17.302±0.010, 45.498±0.072, 47.344±0.021, 7.634±0.050, 0.253±0.003 and 93.829±0.015, 17.412±0.064, 64.866±0.058, 31.777±0.051, 6.768±0.010 and 0.343±0.004, respectively.ConclusionsThe mineral contents in the medicinal plants are at different levels. Therefore, these medicinal plants are rich in some essential elements and very least amount in trace elements, especially Fe and Mn which are essential for human health.Nomenclature reappraisal, diversity pattern and palaeoclimatic implications of Jurassic, Triassic and Early Cretaceous pycnoxylic woods in India are undertaken in the present study. Among the fourteen generic names published previously, only eight are validly published and the rest are nomenclaturally illegitimate. About 51 species were reported under these genera to date. There is a gradual increase of species diversity of fossil wood from the Triassic to Early Cretaceous. The nature of the growth rings was applied to understand the palaeoclimate. The lack of distinct growth rings in the Triassic woods suggests absence of seasonality. The Jurassic woods with an inconsistency in growth rings and presence of growth interruptions suggest climate was seasonal and turbulent. During the Early Cretaceous, conifer dominated vegetation and with wider growth rings and gradual transition suggests warm environments with pronounced seasonality. The general increase in mean ring width from the Triassic to Early Cretaceous indicates ameliorating climatic conditions, particularly benign summer conditions.Spilanthes ciliata (S. ciliata) is a perennial herb of global importance owing to its luscious source of bioactive fatty acid derived amides known as N-alkylamides. It finds application in skin creams, mouth gels and toothpastes. Despite multifaceted applications, a major limitation associated for its commercial application is the scarcity of contamination free plant source, fluctuations in active metabolites due to variation in extraction procedures, and lack of rapid qualitative method for alkylamide profiling. In the current work, attempts were made to 1) optimize conditions for mass propagation of contamination free plants of S. ciliata by tissue culture using leaf discs as explants, 2) establish an optimum extraction ratio of plant/solvent (w/v) for maximum elution of alkylamides and 3) develop a rapid method for qualitative estimation of alkylamide from in vitro raised plants in comparison with that of the field grown counterpart by using LC-Q-TOF (HRMS). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first qualitative report on alkylamide profile of micropropagated whole plant of Spilanthes. The correlation pattern reported in this study may form the basis for using tissue culture raised plantlets of S. ciliata as potential source of bioactive alkylamides on industrial scale.Empirical research provides contradictory evidence of the loss of traditional ecological knowledge across societies. Researchers have argued that culture, methodological differences, and site-specific conditions are responsible for such contradictory evidences. We advance and test a third explanation: the adaptive nature of traditional ecological knowledge systems. Specifically, we test whether different domains of traditional ecological knowledge experience different secular changes and analyze trends in the context of other changes in livelihoods. We use data collected among 651 Tsimane\\' men (Bolivian Amazon). Our findings indicate that different domains of knowledge follow different secular trends. Among the domains of knowledge analyzed, medicinal knowledge and wild edible knowledge appear as the most vulnerable; canoe building knowledge and firewood knowledge seem to remain constant across generations; whereas house building knowledge seems to experience a slight secular increase. Our analysis reflects on the adaptive nature of traditional ecological knowledge, highlighting how changes in this knowledge system respond to the particular needs of a society in a given point of time.Black pepper, popularly known as the “King of Spices”, has a very checkered history dating back to the times of Queen Sheeba and King Solomon (BC 1015–BC 66) and has influenced the destiny of nations and their people, spread across the world, both economically and culturally. Today pepper commands the leading position among the different spices as the spice of immense commercial importance in world trade and is finding its way into the dietary habits of millions around the world, even among people on the European and North American continents, hitherto unaccustomed to its use. Pepper use ranges from a simple dietary constituent to that of immense pharmacological benefits. Though beset with many problems, both agronomic and economic, it is a safe bet that pepper will emerge as the world’s most sought after spice, its predicted global demand escalating colossally to about 280,000 metric tons by the year 2020 that will further climb to 360,000 metric tons by the year 2050. This very exhaustive review details the various constraints to enhancing productivity of pepper and charts contours of a new course of action. Among the primary constraints in pepper production is the absence of an ideotype that combines many positive traits to boost production potential, whilst at the same time resisting ravages of nature such as the onslaught of the dreaded disease “Foot Rot” caused by Phytophthora fungi, whch is the most devastating. Fertility management of pepper soils is still rooted in classical “text book” knowledge. The review also includes the relevance of a refreshing new concept, developed by the author, which is now universally known as “the nutrient buffer power concept”, in enhancing pepper productivity.This work evaluates the impact of climate change on the water balance of a catchment in India. Rainfall and hydro-meteorological variables for current (20C3M scenario, 1981–2000) and two future time periods: mid of the 21st century (2046–2065) and end of the century (2081–2100) are simulated using Modified Markov Model-Kernel Density Estimation (MMM-KDE) and k-nearest neighbor downscaling models. Climate projections from an ensemble of 5 GCMs (MPI-ECHAM5, BCCR-BCM2.0, CSIRO-mk3.5, IPSL-CM4, and MRI-CGCM2) are used in this study. Hydrologic simulations for the current as well as future climate scenarios are carried out using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) integrated with ArcGIS (ArcSWAT v.2009). The results show marginal reduction in runoff ratio, annual streamflow and groundwater recharge towards the end of the century. Increased temperature and evapotranspiration project an increase in the irrigation demand towards the end of the century. Rainfall projections for the future shows marginal increase in the annual average rainfall. Short and moderate wet spells are projected to decrease, whereas short and moderate dry spells are projected to increase in the future. Projected reduction in streamflow and groundwater recharge along with the increase in irrigation demand is likely to aggravate the water stress in the region under the future scenario.ation of alternative energy technologies such as biogas in various parts of the world has rarely led to a success rate of 90%. This study in Sirsi block, Karnataka, south India, revealed that 43% of rural households (HH) had dung resources to operate biogas plants and 65% of them had already built biogas plants. 100% of the plants built were functioning satisfactorily and 85% of HH with biogas plants met all their cooking energy needs with biogas, improving the quality of life of women. The presence of multiple agencies in the dissemination network, participation of entrepreneurs competing to assist households in all aspects of biogas plant construction, commissioning, procuring subsidy, guaranteed performance and free servicing contributed to the high rate of success (of 100% of biogas plants being functional). Most biogas plants built had excess plant capacity, with cost implications. An observed shift in the design choice from mild steel floating drum design to fibre reinforced plastic-based floating drum design and then to a less expensive fixed dome model shows that rural households respond quickly to technological developments. The paper discusses the roles of various factors and their implications for future dissemination programmes.ObjectiveTo conduct an ethnobotanical studies and collect information about the wild edible plants collected and utilized by the Irula tribes of Pillur valley, Coimbatore District, Tamil Nadu, India.MethodsThe study was conducted among the Irula peoples of Pillur valley through survey, interview and field work along with the knowledgeable individuals during January 2009 – September 2010. All the traditional and other knowledge related to the collection and consumption of wild edible plants on which the communities depend was documented.ResultsA total of 74 plant species have been recorded as wild edible in the study areas, of which, fruits yielding plants ranked first with 42 species, green leaves, tubers, young shoots and flowers ranked next with 26, 7, 4 and 2 species respectively.ConclusionsOur study revealed that the adivasi community in the Pillur Valley continues to have and use the knowledge about the wild edible plants, including their habitat, collection period, sustainable collection, mode of preparation and consumption. To date, this knowledge appear to be fairly well conserved and used as a result of continued reliance of local community on the wild uncultivated foods.Rohitukine, a chromone alkaloid, possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and immuno-modulatory properties. It has been reported from four species, belonging to the families, Meliaceae and Rubiaceae. Stem bark of Dysoxylum binectariferum (Meliaceae) accumulates the highest amount of rohitukine (3–7% by dry weight). In this study, we examine the spatial and temporal distribution of rohitukine and related compounds during various stages of seed development in D. binectariferum using desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI MSI). Rohitukine (m/z 306.2) accumulation increased from early seed development to seed maturity stage. The spatial distribution of rohitukine was largely restricted to the cotyledonary tissue followed by the embryo and least in the seed coat. Besides rohitukine, rohitukine acetate (m/z 348.2) and glycosylated rohitukine (m/z 468.2) were also detected, both through mass fragmentation and exact mass analysis through Orbitrap mass spectrometry. These results indicate a dynamic pattern of chromane alkaloid accumulation through seed development in D. binectariferum.The competence of the living creatures to sense and respond to light is well known. The effect of darkness and different color light quality on biomass, extracellular and intracellular pigment yield of five potent pigment producers Monascus purpureus, Isaria farinosa, Emericella nidulans, Fusarium verticillioides and Penicillium purpurogenum, with different color shades such as red, pink, reddish brown and yellow, were investigated. Incubation in total darkness increased the biomass, extracellular and intracellular pigment production in all the fungi. Extracellular red pigment produced by M. purpureus resulted maximum in darkness 36.75\\xa0±\\xa02.1 OD and minimum in white unscreened light 5.90\\xa0±\\xa01.1 OD. Similarly, intracellular red pigment produced by M. purpureus resulted maximum in darkness 18.27\\xa0±\\xa00.9 OD/g and minimum in yellow light 8.03\\xa0±\\xa00.6 OD/g of substrate. The maximum biomass production was also noticed in darkness 2.51\\xa0g/L and minimum in yellow light 0.5\\xa0g/L of dry weight. In contrast, growth of fungi in green and yellow wavelengths resulted in low biomass and pigment yield. It was found that darkness, (red 780–622\\xa0nm, blue 492–455\\xa0nm) and white light influenced pigment and biomass yield.Ethnopharmacological relevanceThere is very limited information regarding plants used by traditional healers in Rangamati, Bangladesh, for treating general ailments. Current study provides significant ethnopharmacological information, both qualitative and quantitative on medical plants in Rangamati.Aim of the studyThis study aimed to collect, analyze and evaluate the rich ethnopharmacologic knowledge on medicinal plants in Rangamati and attempted to identify the important species used in traditional medicine. Further analysis was done by comparison of the traditional medicinal use with the available scientific literature data.Materials and methodsThe field survey was carried out in a period of about one year in Rangamati, Bangladesh. A total of 152 people were interviewed, including Traditional Health Practitioners (THPs) and indigenous people through open-ended and semistructured questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. This ethnomedicinal knowledge was compared against the literature for reports of related uses and studies of phytochemical compounds responsible for respective ailments.ResultsA total of 144 species of plants, mostly trees, belonging to 52 families were identified for the treatment of more than 90 types of ailments. These ailments were categorized into 25 categories. Leaves were the most frequently used plant parts and decoction is the mode of preparation of major portions of the plant species. The most common mode of administration was oral ingestion and topical application. Informant consensus factor (Fic) values of the present study reflected the high agreement in the use of plants in the treatment of gastro-intestinal complaints and respiratory problems among the informants. Gastro-intestinal complaint had highest use-reports and 3 species of plants, namely Aegle marmelos (L.) Corr., Ananas comosus (L.) Merr., and Terminalia chebula (Gaertn.) Retz., had the highest fidelity level (FL) of 100%. Asparagus racemosus Willd. and Azadirachta indica A. Juss. showed the highest relative importance (RI) value of 1.86. According to use value (UV) the most important species were Azadirachta indica A. Juss. (2.48) and Ocimum sanctum L. (2.45).ConclusionAs a result of the present study, we recommend giving priority for further phytochemical investigation to plants that scored highest FL, Fic, UV or RI values, as such values could be considered as good indicator of prospective plants for discovering new drugs. Also counseling of THPs should be taken into consideration in order to smooth continuation and extension of traditional medical knowledge and practice for ensuring safe and effective therapy.Hemidactylus geckos are a species-rich component of many tropical lizard assemblages. We sampled deeply among tropical Asian, and especially South Asian, taxa and used a multi-gene approach to establish the affinities of Indian and Sri Lankan Hemidactylus and to evaluate the monophyly of previously proposed taxa within the genus. There is only weak support for the monophyly of tropical Asian Hemidactylus as a whole, but two strongly supported subclades were retrieved: the bowringii group is a predominantly East Asian clade that reaches South Asia only peripherally; the brookii group is a morphologically diverse clade that represents a previously unrecognized, species-rich (25 species), chiefly South Asian radiation. Deep genetic divergences support the specific recognition of three Sri Lankan taxa previously regarded as subspecies of mainland forms and validate H. subtriedrus as a species distinct from H. triedrus. Unlike several other vertebrate groups, Sri Lankan Hemidactylus do not represent a single insular radiation. Rather, each of six Sri Lankan species reached the island independently from different continental sources. There have been extensive Quaternary land connections between India and Sri Lanka but sister-species pairs of Hemidactylus on the two land masses diverged from one another much earlier, probably in the mid-Miocene.Tropical forests store higher above ground biomass (AGB) and AGB carbon (AGBC) than any other forest ecosystems. In the present study the tree composition, diversity, dominance and carbon stocks in the AGB and soil of tropical forests viz., the Gibbon wildlife sanctuary (GWS) and the Kholahat reserve forest (KRF) of Assam, India were assessed. Soil sampling, tree survey, girth above 1.3\\xa0m height of plants >10\\xa0cm girth of plants were assessed in 1000\\xa0m2 quadrate. Allometric model for moist forest stands was used to determine AGB and AGBC. A total of 71 and 108 different tree species belong to 32 and 42 families were found in the GWS and KRF, respectively. In the GWF, the Shannon diversity index (1.22) and the Simpson index (0.085) were significant, while for the KRF these indices were insignificant. The basal area, AGB and AGBC in the GWS and KRF were 62.49–90.29\\xa0m2\\xa0ha−1, 135.30–146.42\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1, and 67.64–73.21\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−1, respectively. The average soil carbon stock (SOC) in the upper, middle and lower layers was 57.74–78.44\\xa0kg\\xa0m−2, 39.22–64.93\\xa0kg\\xa0m−2 and 30.32–42.86\\xa0kg\\xa0m−2, respectively, in the GWS and KRF. However, compared to GWS, a higher AGB and AGBC were found in KRF. This finding reveals that the higher AGB, AGBC and SOC in the KRF were due to old growth matured forest with big and diverse tree species.Tropical forests store higher above ground biomass (AGB) and AGB carbon (AGBC) than any other forest ecosystems.

This includes the endemic genera Aspidura, Balanophis, Cercaspis, Haplocercus, and Pseudotyphlops, which are of uncertain phylogenetic affinity. We present phylogenetic evidence from nuclear and mitochondrial loci showing the relationships of 40 snake species from Sri Lanka (22 endemics) to the remaining global snake fauna. To determine the phylogenetic placement of these species, we create a molecular dataset containing 10 genes for all global snake genera, while also sampling all available species for genera with endemic species occurring in Sri Lanka. Our sampling comprises five mitochondrial genes (12S, 16S, cyt-b, ND2, and ND4) and five nuclear genes (BDNF, c-mos, NT3 RAG-1, and RAG-2), for a total of up to 9582\\xa0bp per taxon. We find that the five endemic genera represent portions of four independent colonizations of Sri Lanka, with Cercaspis nested within Colubrinae, Balanophis in Natricinae, Pseudotyphlops in Uropeltidae, and that Aspidura\\xa0+\\xa0Haplocercus represents a distinct, ancient lineage within Natricinae. We synonymize two endemic genera that render other genera paraphyletic (Haplocercus with Aspidura, and Cercaspis with Lycodon), and discover that further endemic radiations may be present on the island, including a new taxon from the blindsnake family Typhlopidae, suggesting a large endemic radiation. Despite its small size relative to other islands such as New Guinea, Borneo, and Madagascar, Sri Lanka has one of the most phylogenetically diverse island snake faunas in the world, and more research is needed to characterize the island’s biodiversity, with numerous undescribed species in multiple lineages.A concern has been raised in many parts of the world over the effect of large scale planting of Eucalyptus on hydrological behaviour of small watersheds. Hydrological response of watersheds due to conversion of natural grasslands into bluegum (Eucalyptus globulus) plantations on low flows and high flows has been presented in this paper. The concept of using low flow index (LFI) as a tool to study and quantify the effects of bluegum plantation on low flow regime has been demonstrated. Conversion of natural grasslands into bluegum plantations has resulted in decreased low flow volume as well as peak flow, which in turn increased the soil moisture losses. These effects were more pronounced during the second rotation (i.e. first coppiced growth) as compared to the first rotation. Significant reduction in low flow as a result of decline in base flow could be predicted with LFI decreasing by 2.0 and 3.75 times, in the first and second rotation, respectively. Moderation in peak discharge rates was also observed as a result of bluegum plantation. Probability plots of peak discharge tend to suggest that the effect of bluegum plantation on peak flows become insignificant for the floods with higher return periods. These results clearly suggest that caution need to be exercised while planning large scale conversion of natural grasslands into bluegum plantations in the catchments of hydro-electric reservoirs in the Nilgiris which adversely affects water availability especially during lean flow period.Flood basalts are receiving increasing attention as possible host formations for geologic sequestration of anthropogenic CO2, with studies underway in the U.S., India, Iceland, and Canada. Our previous laboratory studies with Columbia River basalts showed relative quick precipitation of carbonate minerals compared to other siliclastic rocks when batch reacted with water and supercritical CO2. In this study, our prior work with Columbia River basalt was extended to tests with basalts from the eastern U.S., India, and Africa. The basalts are all similar in bulk chemistry and share common minerals such as plagioclase, augite, and a glassy mesostasis. Single pass flow through dissolution experiments under dilute solution and mildly acidic conditions indicate similar cation release behavior among the basalt samples tested. Despite similar bulk chemistry and apparent dissolution kinetics, long-term static experiments with CO2 saturated water show significant differences in rates of mineralization as well as precipitate chemistry and morphology. For example, basalt from the Newark Basin in the U.S. is by far the most reactive of any basalt tested to date. Carbonate reaction products for the Newark Basin basalt were globular in form and contained significantly more Fe than the secondary carbonates that precipitated on the other basalt samples. Calcite grains with classic “dogtooth spar” morphology and trace cation substitution (Mg and Mn) were observed in post-reacted samples associated with the Columbia River basalts. Other basalts produced solid precipitates with compositions that varied chemically throughout the entire testing period. Polished cross sections of the reacted grains show precipitate overgrowths with irregular regions outlined by dark and bright layers indicative of zonations of different compositions. Chemical differences in the precipitates indicate changes in fluid chemistry unique to the dissolution The Karoo basalt appeared the least reactive, with very limited behavior of each basalt sample reacted with CO2 saturated water. mineralization occurring during the testing period. Additional experiments conducted using mixtures of H2S and CO2 unexpectedly changed the relative reactivity of the basalts. For example, the Karoo basalt was highly reactive in the presence of aqueous dissolved H2S and CO2, evident by small nodules of carbonate coating the basalt grains after 181 days of testing. However the most reactive basalt in pure CO2, Newark Basin, formed limited amounts of carbonate in the presence of H2S. Basalt reactivity in pure CO2 appears to be controlled by the glassy mesostasis chemistry, which is the most reactive component of basalt. With the addition of H2S, the reactivity appears to be controlled by precipitation of insoluble iron sulfides as coatings on the basalt grains.The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol allows Afforestation and Reforestation (A/R) projects as mitigation activities to offset the CO2 in the atmosphere whilst simultaneously seeking to ensure sustainable development for the host country. The Kyoto Protocol was ratified by the Government of India in August 2002 and one of India\\'s objectives in acceding to the Protocol was to fulfil the prerequisites for implementation of projects under the CDM in accordance with national sustainable priorities. The objective of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of using large-scale forestry projects under the CDM in achieving its twin goals using Karnataka State as a case study. The Generalized Comprehensive Mitigation Assessment Process (GCOMAP) Model is used to observe the effect of varying carbon prices on the land available for A/R projects. The model is coupled with outputs from the Lund–Potsdam–Jena (LPJ) Dynamic Global Vegetation Model to incorporate the impacts of temperature rise due to climate change under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2, A1B and B1. With rising temperatures and CO2, vegetation productivity is increased under A2 and A1B scenarios and reduced under B1. Results indicate that higher carbon price paths produce higher gains in carbon credits and accelerate the rate at which available land hits maximum capacity thus acting as either an incentive or disincentive for landowners to commit their lands to forestry mitigation projects.Grewia tiliaefolia is widely used in traditional Indian medicines to cure jaundice, biliousness, dysentery and the diseases of blood. Bioassay-guided fractionation of methanolic extract of the G. tiliaefolia bark has resulted in the isolation of D-erythro-2-hexenoic acid γ-lactone (EHGL) and gulonic acid γ-lactone (GAGL). Hepatoprotective activity of the methanolic extract and the isolated constituents were evaluated against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. The treatment with methanolic extract, EHGL and GAGL at oral doses of 100, 150 and 60\\xa0mg/kg respectively with concomitant CCl4 intraperitoneal injection (1\\xa0ml/kg) significantly reduced the elevated plasma levels of aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase and the incidence of liver necrosis compared with the CCl4-injected group without affecting the concentrations of serum bilirubin and hepatic markers. EHGL and GAGL significantly inhibited the elevated levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and glutathione in liver homogenates. Histology of the liver tissues of the extract and isolated constituents treated groups showed the presence of normal hepatic cords, absence of necrosis and fatty infiltration as similar to the normal control. The results revealed that the hepatoprotective activity of EHGL is significant as similar to the standard drug silymarin. To clarify the influence of the extract and isolated constituents on the protection of oxidative-hepatic damage, we examined in vitro antioxidant properties of the test compounds. The extract and the constituents showed significant free radical scavenging activity. These results suggest that the extract as well as the constituents could protect the hepatocytes from CCl4-induced liver damage perhaps, by their anti-oxidative effect on hepatocytes, hence eliminating the deleterious effects of toxic metabolites from CCl4.he environmental education needs of a currently wealthy developing country, Libya, are outlined. Because of specific local requirements, the data presented clearly shows how such educational requirements differ in many respects from the various Western-style environmental sciences curricula. The aim is to produce graduates capable of comprehending environmental problems as they arise in the different regions of Libya. This involves not only dealing with the effects of new developments but also with peoples who must adapt to new life-styles.Since most of what has to be learned is communicated originally in English to Arabic-speaking students via lectures, visits and books, special emphasis is laid upon the added importance of locally produced bilingual audiovisual teaching aids supported by spoken commentaries, printed texts and glossaries of technical terms used in both languages. A technique for producing such aids has been evolved at the Higher Institute of Technology, Brack, Libya.Malaria is a major public health problem in India and one which contributes significantly to the overall malaria burden in Southeast Asia. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Program of India reported ∼1.6 million cases and ∼1100 malaria deaths in 2009. Some experts argue that this is a serious underestimation and that the actual number of malaria cases per year is likely between 9 and 50 times greater, with an approximate 13-fold underestimation of malaria-related mortality. The difficulty in making these estimations is further exacerbated by (i) highly variable malaria eco-epidemiological profiles, (ii) the transmission and overlap of multiple Plasmodium species and Anopheles vectors, (iii) increasing antimalarial drug resistance and insecticide resistance, and (iv) the impact of climate change on each of these variables. Simply stated, the burden of malaria in India is complex. Here we describe plans for a Center for the Study of Complex Malaria in India (CSCMi), one of ten International Centers of Excellence in Malaria Research (ICEMRs) located in malarious regions of the world recently funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health. The CSCMi is a close partnership between Indian and United States scientists, and aims to address major gaps in our understanding of the complexity of malaria in India, including changing patterns of epidemiology, vector biology and control, drug resistance, and parasite genomics. We hope that such a multidisciplinary approach that integrates clinical and field studies with laboratory, molecular, and genomic methods will provide a powerful combination for malaria control and prevention in India.Identifying reliable methods to evaluate rural poverty alleviation projects is an on-going challenge. Advances in spatial analysis and remote sensing, in particular NDVI, (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), provide new opportunities for poverty alleviation projects and rural communities to understand the context and effect of project initiatives. This study demonstrates the use of NDVI as a practical, low-cost method for evaluating the impact of rural community action and the possible association with vegetation change.India and China reached national sovereignty at the end of the 1940s. Since that time the two countries have made significant industrial progress and they have, relative to other Third World countries, a large number of well-educated people. However, the agricultural developments in India and China have been very different, though the two countries have a similar resources base. While the Chinese peasants, through hard work upon the rural land, have seen a substantial increase in their standard of living, the mass of Indian peasants are still living under severe circumstances and poverty. Furthermore, the rational management of land and water resources are much more advanced in China than in India. An important part of the difference in the agricultural and resources development of the two countries is related to the various guidelines of national economic performance and institutional settings. China has adopted a self-reliant basic-needs-oriented approach of national economic performance, which has given due attention to agricultural development and resources management. India has followed a Western-inspired liberal economic growth model of national economic performance, which has emphasised industrial development directed toward fastgrowing isolated economic enclaves within a basically subsistence economy. The cooperative ownership approach has improved resources management in China, whereas the small peasant/tenant approach in India has been unable to improve the resources management situation. The paper suggests that only a cooperative ownership approach towards land and water resources management will give any future prospect for an improvement in the standard of living for the mass of the people and the resources situation in India. Consequently, research activities in resources management ought to be directed towards cooperative solutions and experiences in India.IntroductionTriphala is a well-known Ayurvedic treatment for bowel problems. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether Triphala(an Ayurvedic formulation) can ameliorate excessive oxidative stress and inflammation of intestinal tract in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)in rats.Materials and methodsAqueous Triphala extract was assessed for Nitric oxide (NO) scavenging and anti-lipid peroxidation activities. Triphala was orally administered in three doses (330, 500 and 1000\\xa0mg/kg/b\\xa0wt), where mesalamine remained as control. Activity of MDA, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and nitrate–nitrite in colon tissues were estimated using plate-based assays. Gene-expression of CAT, SOD, glutathione peroxidise (GPx) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were estimated using Real-Time PCR. Lastly, HE staining was used for histopathological observations.ResultsNO scavenging revealed 80.00% inhibition at 500 and 1000\\xa0μg/ml, whereas complete inhibition of lipid peroxidation obtained at 500 and 1000\\xa0μg/ml concentrations. These activities correlated well with reduced oxidative damage (MDA 3.72\\xa0μM/g of tissue) after Triphala treatment with significant increase in CAT, SOD and nitrate–nitrite activity in colon. Gene-expression of CAT, SOD and GPx increased in dose-dependent manner, while eNOS expression increased at Triphala 500\\xa0mg/kg/b\\xa0wt, demonstrating strengthening effect on innate antioxidant defence. Histopathology of colon revealed muco-protection and restoration of normal tissue architecture. Administration of Triphala at 1000\\xa0mg/kg/b\\xa0wt significantly reduced colonic inflammation measured as reduced colon weight and crypt loss, reduction in infiltration by pro-inflammatory cells and focal necrotic areas in mucosa.ConclusionTriphala has promising potential for the treatment of IBD given its strong antioxidant effects in reducing inflammation.Environmental covariates are the basis of predictive soil mapping. Their selection determines the performance of soil mapping to a great extent, especially in cases where the number of soil samples is limited but soil spatial heterogeneity is high. In this study, we proposed an integrated method to select environmental covariates for predictive soil depth mapping. First, candidate variables that may influence the development of soil depth were selected based on pedogenetic knowledge. Second, three conventional methods (Pearson correlation analysis (PsCA), generalized additive models (GAMs), and Random Forest (RF)) were used to generate optimal combinations of environmental covariates. Finally, three optimal combinations were integrated to produce a final combination based on the importance and occurrence frequency of each environmental covariate. We tested this method for soil depth mapping in the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin in Northwest China. A total of 129 soil sampling sites were collected using a representative sampling strategy, and RF and support vector machine (SVM) models were used to map soil depth. The results showed that compared to the set of environmental covariates selected by the three conventional selection methods, the set of environmental covariates selected by the proposed method achieved higher mapping accuracy. The combination from the proposed method obtained a root mean square error (RMSE) of 11.88 cm, which was 2.25–7.64 cm lower than the other methods, and an R2 value of 0.76, which was 0.08–0.26 higher than the other methods. The results suggest that our method can be used as an alternative to the conventional methods for soil depth mapping and may also be effective for mapping other soil properties.In the continuing race between man and nature, the ecological balance has been upset. It is becoming increasingly important for the Indian people to combat the danger inherent in the growing deterioration of the natural environment, the degradation of land, poisoning of the air, rivers and reservoirs and the pollution of cities. A third of India\\'s potential agricultural land and three-fourths of the non-agricultural land is lying practically useless. Besides, three-fifths of our total agricultural land is degraded and, on the whole, three-quarters of all the land under cultivation and in forests needs urgent care. Such a state of affairs is partly due to the poverty and overpopulation in our country, and is partly because of complacency, ignorance and lack of policy and organisation at the highest levels. It is a sad but undeniable fact that our forest departments have, by and large, failed to protect our 70 odd million hectares of forest lands against encroachments, unauthorised felling and denudation. It is estimated that 6,000 million tonnes of top soil are displaced every monsoon season by water erosion. The environment has begun to show obvious signs of the misuse of our natural envirnoment. A classic example of this is the entire exercise in flood control in the Ganga basin. The silent valley controversy in Kerala focussed the nation\\'s attention on the plight of the tropical evergreen forests. Silted-up reservoirs no longer have their original capacity.It has been widely recognized that food security depends on the sustainable use and provisioning of ecosystem services. The goal of this paper is to present an overview of the scientific literature on ecosystem services and food security, with a major focus on case studies of farming communities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, in order to answer the following research questions: (1) does ecosystem services research generate knowledge that helps to address the major imperatives of food security?, and (2) are the multiple linkages between ecosystem services and food security analyzed or assumed in research? The results of the study highlighted that food utilization, access and stability, which are the major food security challenges in the world, remained under-investigated. There is a major bias on food availability in relation to crop production, and most articles assumed that food security would improve by increasing crop productivity, but this hypothesis remained largely untested. Other research blind-spots were co-production, trade-offs and off-site effects of ecosystem services in relation to food security, gender and cultural services. The study concludes that ecosystem services research needs to improve efforts to generate knowledge that helps to address the main imperatives of food security.Coastal zones are dynamic areas that are constantly undergoing change in response to a multitude of factors including sea level rise, wave and current patterns, hurricanes and human influences. On 26th December 2004, huge waves smashed across the shore between Kanyakumari and Ovari. As they crossed the beach, the waves up to 30 feet tall. Many people are dead due to crush and pull to sea and drowned as the mighty waves withdraw. Many villages have been obliterated, the death tale could exceed 300 but the damage to the property is very high. The size of the tsunami is related to the area that moves on the ocean bottom and how far it moves. This region is manifested with marine terrace, sand dunes, beach ridges, estuaries, floodplains, beaches, mangroves, peneplains, uplands, sea cliff, etc. We have attempted the shoreline dynamics using beach profile survey, and coastal environment changes through online survey, governmental, records and coastal geomorphological studies using remote sensing technique. The major destructions are identified in this paper.The Tiger (Panthera (Felis) tigris) has suffered a catastrophic decline in numbers in all countries within its range, so that, today, there are probably no more than 5,000 animals of the eight races remaining in the wild. Although, in certain countries, the Tiger is given protection, in others it is still under heavy persecution. Surviving populations are now too scattered to maintain a viable genetic interchange. The chief cause of the decline has been the massive destruction of forests in Asia, but unrestricted hunting and poisoning and the demand for skins by the fur trade have also been important factors. Strenuous international efforts are now being made to create fourteen special reserves in order to save the Indian Tiger race, of which about 2,350 individuals remain.ObjectiveTo characterize abundance of leaf litter actinomycetes from Ternate Island and to assess the antifungal activity of actinomycetes isolates against Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), and Aspergillus niger.MethodsActinomycetes were isolated from leaf litter of Durio species, Syzygium aromaticum, Piper betle, Myristica fragrans, or Pandanus species and unknown plants. Actinomycetes isolates were cultured in a liquid medium. Bioactive compounds were extracted and tested against fungal using Beury-Kirby method with modification. Minimum inhibitor concentration and cell leakages were conducted. Actinomycetes that produced the highest antifungal activity were indentified using molecular sequence data in 16S rRNA gene.ResultsOut of 50 selected isolates, two isolates MG-500-1-4 and SR-2-2 has highest activity against S. cerevisiae. Concentration of material containing nucleic acids, proteins, Ca+ and K+ ions and morphological observations indicated that extracts of MG-500-1-4 and SR-2-2 caused cell leakage and invagination of S. cerevisiae cells. Based on 16S rRNA gene identification, MG-500-1-4 and SR-2-2 isolates are similar to Streptomyces misakiensis and Streptomyces tricolor respectively.ConclusionsTernate Island contains interesting biodiversity of actinomycetes that has potential use in agriculture, fisheries, and human health to reduce problem of fungal pathogen.ObjectiveTo explore the biotechnological potential of Ophiorrhiza mungos for micropropagation and camptothecin (CPT) production from in vitro grown plants.MethodsSurface sterilized explants of O. mungos were transferred aseptically in MS media containing various combinations of phytohormones for callus initiation and multiple shoot proliferation. The content of CPT was quantified in the methanolic extract of O. mungos plants and in in vitro grown plants by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).ResultsMaximum fresh weight and dry weight biomass of O. mungos callus was obtained from MS medium supplemented with IAA (2 ppm) + BAP (2 ppm) + GA (1 ppm). The maximum shoot proliferation (25) and elongation (6.5 cm) was found in MS medium supplemented with Picloram + Thidiazuron + Gibberellic Acid in 1:2:1 ratio after four weeks of incubation. The maximum content of CPT (0.0768 % w/w) was found in whole in vitro plants whereas the minimum CPT was observed in adventitious buds (0.0026 % w/w) as compared to the naturally grown O. mungos plants (0.0030% w/w).ConclusionsPresent findings indicate that O. mungos plants respond favourably for in vitro propagation and also produce higher amount of CPT as compared to naturally grown plants.The genus Hemitragus includes three species of tahr distributed in distant geographical areas: the Himalayan tahr, H. jemlahicus, occupies the southern flanks of the Himalaya Mountains; the Nilgiri tahr, H. hylocrius, is endemic to southern India; and the Arabian tahr, H. jayakari, is unique to the mountains of south-east Arabia. All previous investigations were based on morphology, and these three species together have never been included in a molecular phylogenetic study. In this study, we constructed a molecular phylogeny of the tribe Caprini sensu lato to determine the taxonomic status of the three species of tahr. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out on a matrix including most extant species currently described in the tribe Caprini sensu lato, and 3165 nucleotide characters, coming from four different markers, i.e., an intron of the nuclear gene coding for the protein kinase C iota, and three mitochondrial genes (subunit II of the cytochrome c oxidase, cytochrome b, and 12S rRNA). The results show that the genus Hemitragus is polyphyletic, as H. jemlahicus is associated with Capra (goats), H. hylocrius is the sister-group of Ovis (sheep), and H. jayakari is allied with Ammotragus lervia (aoudad). In the light of these unexpected results, we revaluate the validity of the morphological characters originally used for defining the genus Hemitragus. At least, we propose a new taxonomy, where the three species of tahr are ranged into three monospecific genera: the genus Hemitragus is restricted to the Himalayan tahr, and two new genera are created: Arabitragus for the Arabian tahr and Nilgiritragus for the Nilgiri tahr.Ethnopharmacological relevanceDysentery and diarrhoea are major causes of morbidity and mortality in rural communities of developing world. The Bhoxa community is an important primitive indigenous community of Uttarakhand, India. In this paper we have tried to scientifically enumerate ethnomedicinal plants and herbal preparations used by Bhoxa community to treat dysentery and diarrhoea, and discuss their antidiarrhoeal properties in the light of previous ethnomedicinal, pharmacological, microbiological and phytochemical studies. To record plants and herbal preparations used by Bhoxa community of district Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India in treatment of dysentery and diarrhoea, and to discuss antidiarrhoeal and antimicrobial properties of the recorded plants.Materials and methodsEthnomedicinal survey was conducted in different villages of Bhoxa community located in district Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India. Thirty Bhoxa traditional healers were interviewed to collect information on plants used by them for treating dysentery and diarrhoea. For each of the recorded plant species the use value (UV) and fidelity level (FL) was calculated. Detailed literature survey was conducted to summarize ethnomedicinal, pharmacological, microbiological and phytochemical information on the medicinal plants listed in the present study.ResultsFifty medicinal plants (45 genera and 30 families) were used by Bhoxa community to treat dysentery and diarrhoea, among which 27 species were used for dysentery, 41 for diarrhoea and 18 for both dysentery and diarrhoea. Three plants viz., Dioscorea bulbifera L., Euphorbia thymifolia L. and Prunus persica (L.) Stokes, recorded in the present survey have been reported for the first time in treatment of dysentery and diarrhoea by any indigenous communities in India. FL and UV values revealed that most preferred species for the treatment of dysentery and diarrhoea by Bhoxa community are Euphorbia hirta L. followed by Holarrhena pubescens Wall., Helicteres isora L. and Cassia fistula L. Earlier pharmacological studies confirmed that 27 of the recorded plants have some proven antidiarrhoeal properties and remaining 23 plants have to be pharmacologically evaluated for their antidiarrhoeal properties. Except 6 plants all the other recorded plants have shown antimicrobial properties in previous microbiological studies. Previous studies have corroborated the ethnomedicinal claims made by the traditional healers of the Bhoxa community.ConclusionsPresent study has provided new information on many medicinal plants and their uses. All the three newly reported plants for treatment of dysentery and diarrhoea have not been pharmacologically evaluated yet for their possible antidiarrhoeal properties. Twenty-three and six plants have not been evaluated pharmacologically and microbiologically, respectively. The present information may serve as a baseline data to initiate further research for discovery of new compounds and biological activities of these potential plants. Further research on these plants may provide some important clues for development of new drugs for dysentery and diarrhoea or other related diseases.Gridded rainfall data of 0.5×0.5° resolution (CRU TS 3.21) was analysed to study long term spatial and temporal trends on annual and seasonal scales in Wainganga river basin located in Central India during 1901–2012. After testing the presence of autocorrelation, Mann–Kendall (Modified Mann–Kendall) test was applied to non-auto correlated (auto correlated) series to detect the trends in rainfall data. Theil and Sen׳s slope estimator test was used for finding the magnitude of change over a time period. For detecting the most probable change year, Pettitt–Mann–Whitney test was applied. The Rainfall series was then divided into two partial duration series for finding changes in trends before and after the change year. Arc GIS was used to explore spatial patterns of the trends over the entire basin. Though most of the grid points shows a decreasing trend in annual rainfall, only seven grids has a significant decreasing trend during 1901–2012. On the basis of seasonal trend analysis, non-significant increasing trend is observed only in post monsoon season while seven grid points show significant decreasing trend in monsoon rainfall and non-significant in pre-monsoon and winter rainfall over the last 112 years. During the study period, overall a 8.45% decrease in annual rainfall is estimated. The most probable year of change was found to be 1948 in annual and monsoonal rainfall. There is an increasing rainfall trend in the basin during the period 1901–1948, which is reversed during the period 1949–2012 resulting in decreasing rainfall trend in the basin. Homogeneous trends in annual and seasonal rainfall over a grid points is exhibited in the basin by van Belle and Hughes׳ homogeneity trend test.Landscape ecology has brought spatial analysis and geospatial modeling to the forefront of ecological research. In this study, we investigated changes in landscape structure and the ecological consequences of urbanization in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area using spatial indices, change analysis, and geospatial modeling. Major land transformation patterns from 1975 to 2006 were mapped using multi-temporal classification maps. Landscape metrics for 1975, 1986, 1998, and 2006 were calculated and analyzed using Patch Analyst. The deforestation process due to urbanization in the future was modeled using GEOMOD within the framework of 2030 regional land use planning. Results reveal urban area expanded 82% from 1975 to 2006, mainly by displacing forest and agricultural lands by in-filling gaps within the urban area or near its periphery. Leap-frog development was noticeably absent. Many small patches of forest and agriculture located within or near the urban and suburban areas were replaced directly by urban land uses. Urbanization has become ecologically complicated but geometrically simpler whereas the rural landscape became less abundant and diverse. We predict: (1) forest cover will continue to decrease consistently due to on-going urbanization process; and (2) the pattern of deforestation will occur within the urban area due to in-filling and along its periphery as the urban area expands outward into undeveloped areas.End use efficiency experiments conducted in some households of Masur village (based on 4 days experiment) of Kumta taluk show that there is scope for saving 27–42% of energy by switching to improved devices, which are designed to maximise combustion rate (of fuel, ensuring the presence of sufficient oxygen), radiant heat transfer (from fire to vessels, keeping them as close to fire as possible), convection (to pass maximum hot gas over vessels, reducing drafts), conduction (heat is concentrated near the vessels by using insulating material for the stove) and user satisfaction (with user friendly design). The thermal performances of improved stoves designed at our Institute (ASTRA) have also been studied in the field. Irrespective of type of fuel, community, etc., improved stoves show significant saving in fuel. By switching to energy efficient devices 450,548 to 700,853 tonnes of fuel wood can be saved per year in the district.A generalised linear model was used to predict climatically suitable habitat for the golden bowerbird (Prionodura newtonia De Vis), an endemic species of the Wet Tropics of North Queensland. Mean temperature of the coldest quarter and mean precipitation of the wettest quarter were found to be the best habitat predictors. For independent validation data, accuracy was 67% (Kappa statistic, n=30). Past, and future habitats suitable to the golden bowerbird were mapped by altering the temperature and precipitation input to the model. In the current climate, total potential habitat is estimated to be 1564 km2, occurring as a number of separate patches with distinct bowerbird subpopulations. Past habitat was most limiting, 406 km2, during the Holocene climatic optimum (c. 5000–3600 YBP, +2\\xa0°C and +50% rainfall relative to today). With future warming, assuming a 10% decrease in rainfall, potential habitat is reduced to 582 km2 (1\\xa0°C warming), 163 km2 (2\\xa0°C warming) and 37 km2 (3\\xa0°C warming). Thus, global warming in the coming decades is likely to be a significant threat to the survival of this and similar upland and highland species in the tropics.The present study is proposed to determine the antioxidant activity of raw and processed samples of underutilized legumes, Entada scandens seed kernel and Canavalia gladiata seeds. The indigenous processing methods like dry heating, autoclaving and soaking followed by autoclaving in different solutions (plain water, ash, sugar and sodium bicarbonate) were adopted to seed samples. All other processing methods than dry heat showed significant reduction in phenolics (2.9–63%), tannins (26–100%) and flavonoids (14–67%). However, in processed samples of E. scandens, the hydroxyl radical scavenging activity and β-carotene bleaching inhibition activity were increased, whereas, 2,2-azinobis (3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS+), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), metal chelating and superoxide anion scavenging activity were similar to unprocessed ones. In contrary, except dry heating in C. gladiata, all other processing methods significantly (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) reduced the 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) (20–35%), ABTS+ (22–75%), FRAP (34–74%), metal chelating (30–41%), superoxide anion radical scavenging (8–80%), hydroxyl radical scavenging (20–40%) and β-carotene bleaching inhibition activity (15–69%). In addition, the sample extracts of raw and dry heated samples protected DNA damage at 10\\xa0μg. All processing methods in E. scandens and dry heating in C. gladiata would be a suitable method for adopting in domestic or industrial processing.As part of an energy-reduction study at remote sites, we explore a power system comprised of hybrid renewable energy technologies, specifically, photovoltaic cells, battery storage, and diesel generators. An optimization model determines the design and dispatch strategy of the power system to meet load off grid, such as at a military forward operating base. The model alternately uses two types of load data from government agencies, simulated and observed, to assess the effects of these inputs. Because the latter data set contains errors and is incomplete, we detail the process of cleaning and imputing it to provide a year’s worth in hourly increments for two forward operating bases in Afghanistan. We then construct an approximation of a realistic 600-soldier camp load from the full year of observed data. We compare the design and dispatch output from the optimization model using the simulated and constructed (observed) data sets and demonstrate that the results can differ. We investigate the characteristics of load that influence the optimization model’s behavior regarding the design and dispatch strategy and show that mean load has a more pronounced effect than its shape. In addition, the photovoltaic cells are often used to help the generators run more efficiently, especially under load variability.ObjectiveTo determine the anti-bacterial efficacy of chloroform, ethanol, ethyl acetate and water extracts of inter-nodal and leaves derived calli extracts from Mentha arvensis (M. arvensis) against Salmonella typhi(S. typhi), Streptococcus pyogenes(S. pyogenes), Proteus vulgaris(P. vulgaris) and Bacillus subtilis(B. subtilis).MethodsThe inter-nodal and leaves segments of M. arvensis were cut into 0.5-0.7 cm in length and cultured on Murashige and Skoog solid medium supplemented with 3% sucrose, gelled with 0.7% agar and different concentration of 2, 4-Dichlorophenoxyacetie acid (2,4-D) either alone or in combinations. The preliminary phytochemical screening was performed by Brindha et al method. Antibacterial efficacy was performed by disc diffusion method and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C.ResultsMaximum percentage of callus formation (inter-nodal segments 84.3 ± 0.78; leaves segments 93.8 ± 1.27) was obtained on Murashige and Skoog\\'s basal medium supplemented with 3% sucrose and 1.5 mg/L of 2, 4-D. The ethanol extracts of leaves derived calli showed the maximum bio-efficacy than other solvents. The leaves and stem derived calli extracts on Proteus sp. showed that the plants can be used in the treatment of urinary tract infection associated with Proteus sp. Through the bacterial efficacy studies, it is confirmed that the in vitro raised calli tissue was more effective compared to in vivo tissue.ConclusionsThe bio-efficacy study confirmed that the calli mediated tissues showed the maximum zone of inhibition. The present study paved a protocol to establish high potential cell lines by in vitro culture.This article highlights applied understanding of classifying earth imaging data for land cover land use change (LCLUC) information. Compared to the many previous studies of LCLUC, the present study is innovative in that it applied geospatial data, tools and techniques for transdisciplinary research. It contributes to a wider discourse on practical decision making for multi-level governance. Undertaken as part of the BioDIVA project, the research adopted a multi-tiered methodical approach across three key dimensions: socioecology as the sphere of interest, a transdisciplinary approach as the disciplinary framework, and geospatial analysis as the applied methodology. The area of interest was the agroecosystem of Wayanad district in Kerala, India (South Asia). The methodology was structured to enable analysis of multi-scalar and multi-temporal data, using Wayanad as a case study. Three levels of analysis included: District (Landsat TM-30m), Taluk or sub-district (ASTER-15m) and Village or Gram Panchayat (GeoEye-0.5m). Our hypothesis, that analyzing patterns of land use change is pertinent for up-to-date assessment of agroecosystem resources and their wise management is supported by the outcome of the multi-tiered geospatial analysis. In addition, two examples from the project that highlight the adoption of LCLUC by different disciplinary experts are presented. A sociologist assessed the land ownership boundary for a selected tribal community. A faunal ecologist used it to assess the effect of landscape structure on arthropods and plant groups in rice fields. Furthermore, the Google Earth interface was used to support the overall validation process. Our key conclusion was that a multi-level understanding of the causes, effects, processes and mechanisms that govern agroecosystem transformation requires close attention to spatial, temporal and seasonal dynamics, for which the incorporation of local knowledge and participation of local communities is crucial.Ethnopharmacological relevanceInspite of tremendous advances made in allopathic medical practices, herbs still play an important role in the management of various liver diseases. A large number of plants and formulations have been claimed to have hepatoprotective activity. Jaundice is a symptom, indicative of the malfunctioning of the liver. This paper provides ethnomedicinal information on the plants used to treat jaundice by three important indigenous communities, i.e., nomadic Gujjars, Tharu and Bhoxa of Sub-Himalayan region, Uttarakhand, India.Aims of the studyTo record herbal preparations used by the studied indigenous communities in treatment of jaundice and discuss hepatoprotective properties of the recorded plants.Research strategy and methodsThe traditional knowledge of the studied indigenous communities on herbal preparations used for treating jaundice was collected through structured questionnaire and personal interviews. The interviews were conducted with 91 traditional healers (29 Bhoxa, 35 Tharu and 27 nomadic Gujjars) in Sub-Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, India. More than 250 research papers reporting ethnomedicinal information on the hepatoprotective plants used by various communities from different parts of India were extensively reviewed.ResultsA total of 40 medicinal plants belonging to 31 families and 38 genera were recorded to be used by the studied communities in 45 formulations as a remedy of jaundice. Bhoxa, nomadic Gujjars and Tharu communities used 15, 23 and 9 plants, respectively. To our knowledge eight plants reported in the present survey viz., Amaranthus spinosus L., Cissampelos pareira L., Ehretia laevis Roxb., Holarrhena pubescens Wall., Ocimum americanum L., Physalis divaricata D. Don, Solanum incanum L. and Trichosanthes cucumerina L. have not been reported earlier as remedy of jaundice in India. Literature review revealed that a total of 214 (belonging to 181 genus and 78 families), 19 (belonging to 18 genus and 12 families) and 14 (belonging to 14 genus and 11 families) plant species are used as internal, external and magico-religious remedies for jaundice, respectively by various communities in different parts of India. Most widely used hepatoprotective plant species for treatment of jaundice in India is Boerhavia diffusa L. followed by Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers, Saccharum officinarum L., Phyllanthus amarus Schumach. & Thonn., Ricinus communis L., Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Nees., Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz, Lawsonia inermis L. and Eclipta prostrata (L.) L.ConclusionsThe plants recorded in the present survey have also been discussed in relation to pharmacological studies and hepatoprotective phytoconstituents present in them. Most of the recorded plants have shown hepatoprotective effects on experimental animals in earlier studies but more studies are needed to assess hepatoprotective properties of some recorded medicinal plants viz., Averrhoa carambola L., Ehretia laevis Roxb., Holarrhena pubescens Wall., Mangifera indica L., Ocimum americanum L., Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz, Physalis divaricata D. Don, Solanum incanum L., Sphaeranthus senegalensis DC. and Tribulus terrestris L.. The plants enumerated in this study with high number of citations and wider distributions have given some useful leads for further biomedical research. Nevertheless more phytochemical, pharmaceutical and clinical studies are needed to evaluate hepatoprotective properties, efficacy and safety of all the claimed medicinal plants.Two simple solar cookers, one made of clay and locally available materials, and the other of exfoliated vermiculite and cement tiles, have been designed, fabricated and tested. The comparative performance of both cookers is described, and their efficiencies are 22.6 (clay) and 24.9% (vermiculite), respectively. The cookers are capable of boiling 2 kg of animal feed per day, and represent the equivalent of 1350 MJ of fuel per year at Jodhpur. Payback periods for solar cookers made of vermiculite tiles vary from 0.50 to 3.47 years, depending upon the fuel they replace. The shorter payback period suggests that the use of the cooker is economical.This paper describes the main features of the vegetation and vertebrate fauna associated with the River Tambiraparani and its gallery forest in Mundanthurai Wildlife Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu. Forty-seven tree species including several evergreens, 13 scrub and 15 climber-creeper species were recorded in a 0·25 ha area in the riverine forest which is at an altitude of c. 180 m. Thirty-seven species of fishes, 12 species of amphibians and 25 species of reptiles including Dasia haliana, a new record for India, were also collected. Sixty-three species of birds including the blackcapped kingfisher Halcyon pileata, crested-hawk eagle Spizaetus cirrhatus cirrhatus, grey-headed fishing eagle Ichthyophaga ichtyaetus and brown fish owl Bubo zeylonensis occur here. The Nilgiri langur Presbytis johnii, a threatened species, is the most common primate of this gallery forest.The Tambiraparani riverine forest may be one of the few places in India where several evergreen species can still be seen at such a low altitude. A proposal to divert the river water to a nearby hydroelectric reservoir to be commissioned in 1988, and illegal wood cutting, are the major threats to this ecosystem. Three recommendations are suggested to protect this riverine forest for the future.The daily activity pattern of wild Francois\\' langurs (Trachypithecus francoisi francisi) was observed in disturbed habitat at Mayanghe National Nature Reserve of Guizhou Province, China, between 1999 and 2000. The behaviors of wild adult Francois\\' langurs were recorded at a 5-min interval using an instantaneous sampling method. The results indicate that resting, foraging, traveling, huddling, playing and grooming activities account for 35.41%, 31.67%, 14.44%, 9.61%, 8.54% and 0.33%, respectively, in the daily time budget of these adult Francois\\' langurs during the study period. In comparison with the results in undisturbed habitat, the decreased food availability in disturbed habitat changes the foraging behavior of langurs, and also changes time budgets of other behaviors, such as the increase of the proportion of traveling and the decrease of the proportion of resting. At the same time, the higher frequency of human activity in the disturbed habitat influences the time budget of daily social behavior of the langurs including playing, huddling and grooming. The patterns of activity rhythms of wild adult Francois\\' langurs in the disturbed habitat show some seasonal differences which are also discussed.The cyprinid tribe Labeonini (sensu Rainboth, 1991) is a large group of freshwater fishes containing around 40 genera and 400 species. They are characterized by an amazing diversity of modifications to their lips and associated structures. In this study, a total of 34 genera and 142 species of putative members of this tribe, which represent most of the generic diversity and more than one third of the species diversity of the group, were sampled and sequenced for four nuclear genes and five mitochondrial genes (totaling 9465\\xa0bp). Phylogenetic relationships and subdivision of this tribe were investigated and the placement and status of most genera are discussed. Partitioned maximum likelihood analyses were performed based on the nuclear dataset, mitochondrial dataset, combined dataset, and the dataset for each nuclear gene. Inclusion of the genera Paracrossochilus, Barbichthys, Thynnichthys, and Linichthys in the Labeonini was either confirmed or proposed for the first time. None of the genera Labeo, Garra, Bangana, Cirrhinus, and Crossocheilus are monophyletic. Taxonomic revisions of some genera were made: the generic names Gymnostomus Heckel, 1843, Ageneiogarra Garman, 1912 and Gonorhynchus McClelland, 1839 were revalidated; Akrokolioplax Zhang and Kottelat, 2006 becomes a junior synonym of Gonorhynchus; the species Osteochilus nashii was found to be a member of the barbin genus Osteochilichthys. Five historical hypotheses on the classification of the Labeonini were tested and rejected. We proposed to subdivide the tribe, which is strongly supported as monophyletic, into four subtribes: Labeoina, Garraina, Osteochilina, and Semilabeoina. The taxa included in each subtribe were listed and those taxa that need taxonomic revision were discussed.This article investigates how varieties of knowledge about flooding contribute to a more effective flood management (FM) governance configuration in Chennai, India. Drawing on the assemblage perspective and using the configurations approach for socio-spatial analyses of the city, we trace the knowledge construction processes around two networked FM infrastructures, drawing out the different discourses, actor coalitions and processes of practice. We see how technical knowledge on storm water drains is embedded and transformed within the primary government network, and how complementary knowledges about the ery system are expressed through counter mappings by academic activists. Identifying potential intersections between these knowledge processes indicates a strong potential to link long-term water management strategies that would mutually contribute to addressing the city\\'s issues of flood risks and drinking water scarcity. However, we find that the varieties of knowledge around Chennai\\'s FM run in parallel networks with few intersections, presenting distinct institutional boundaries to cross-boundary knowledge sharing. Lastly, using integrated FM as a heuristic framework, we analyse the contributions of the different streams of knowledge and the remaining gaps in order to assess the potential of building up the interconnections in Chennai\\'s FM configuration.Murraya koenigii (L.) Spreng., commonly known as curry leaf plant, is found in the different hilly regions of India. In the present study, fifty-nine accessions representing eight wild populations of M. koenigii were analyzed using thirteen ISSR primers. A total of 152 bands were amplified, out of which, 136 were polymorphic corresponding to 89.47% polymorphism across the accessions. The pairwise population genetic distances were calculated for all the populations that varied from 0.05 to 0.13 between the populations of M. koenigii. AMOVA and Nei’s genetic diversity analysis revealed higher genetic variations within populations than among the populations. The clustering of populations in the dendrogram was not in congruence with geographical affiliations. The results indicate that the ISSR method is sufficiently informative and powerful to estimate the genetic diversity in M. koenigii populations. As M. koenigii is an important wild plant genetic resource, therefore, information on genetic variability might be a potential source as breeding material for development of commercially valuable traits in M. koenigii plants.Over the years, renewable energy based power generation has proven to be a cost-effective solution in stand-alone applications in the regions where grid extension is difficult. The present study focused on the development of models for optimal sizing of integrated renewable energy (IRE) system to satisfy the energy needs in different load sectors of four different zones considered in Chamarajanagar district of Karnataka state in India. The objective of the study is to minimize the total cost of generation and cost of energy using genetic algorithm (GA) based approach. Considering optimization power factor (OPF) and expected energy not supplied (EENS), optimum system feasibility has been investigated. Based on the study, it has been found that IRES is able to provide a feasible solution between 1.0 and 0.8 OPF values. However, power deficit occurs at OPF values less than 0.8 and the proposed model becomes infeasible under such conditions. Customer interruption cost (CIC) and deficit energy (DE) for all zones were also computed to quantify the reliability of the systems.This paper is a case study of the contemporary changes that affect the Sanjay Gandhi National Park and its surroundings in the city of Mumbai. It cross-examines the relationships between urban nature and urban space in the case of a city of the South. We argue that the issue of equitable access to urban nature is embedded in the larger question of the Right to the City. We show how processes of urban growth that lead to a shrinking of the forested area are associated with a differentiation of the Right to the City, rather than a general consolidation of claims on space. Defence of the park is mobilised to redefine urban citizenship and leads to a form of graduated citizenship. This differentiates those who see their claims on urban space consolidated; those whose urban citizenship is degraded, and those for whom urban citizenship is denied.Decalepis hamiltonii (swallow root) belongs to Asclepiadaceae and is an endangered shrub. It is generally considered as a tuberous root food mostly in the southern part of India, being a good source of bioactive compounds and flavour compounds with 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzaldehyde as the major constituent which resembles vanillin. We improved D. hamiltonii plant growth and yield of tubers with enhanced flavour compound, by using triacontanol (TRIA) soil drenching. Irrespective of the plant source, the interactive difference of the TRIA concentration and TRIA treatment interval showed the marked difference for yield and flavour content. The administration of triacontanol (0.228\\xa0μM) soil drenching twice by giving second treatment with a gap of 60 days after initial treatment, showed fast sign of growth and good yield of tubers with enhanced flavour content. The GC–MS profiles of flavour compound 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzaldehyde in tubers showed significant improvement over controls (1.5 times more), which could be useful for various commercial applications.Landslide inventories prepared manually from remote sensing data or through field surveys have shown to be useful for preparation of landslide susceptibility and hazard maps. Recent literatures show several studies have been carried out to prepare landslide inventories from satellite data by automatic methods. However, almost no attempt has been made to validate the effect of such inventories on landslide hazard and risk assessment. In this paper we have shown how landslide inventories prepared by semi-automatic methods from post-event satellite images can be used in the assessment of landslide susceptibility, hazard and risk in the High Himalayan terrain in India. A susceptibility map was made using the weights-of-evidence method, wherein weights were derived using the semi-automatically prepared historical landslide inventories combined with a series of pre-disposing factor maps. Seven evidence layers were used for the calculation of weights, selected in such a way that the majority could be derived from satellite data. Validation was done using the test data created through a temporal subsetting of the inventories. Temporal probability was calculated through Gumbel frequency distribution analysis using daily rainfall data of a 13\\xa0year period for which landslide inventories were prepared from satellite data. Spatial probability was determined by calculating landslide density for the inventories per susceptibility class that represent a given return period. Elements at risk, such as buildings and roads, were interpreted from a high resolution Cartosat-1 (2.5\\xa0m) image. Absolute vulnerability of the buildings and roads were multiplied with landslide spatial probability to derive the total loss for different return-period scenarios and shown in a risk curve. This study has shown that the inventories prepared semi-automatically can be used for landslide hazard and risk assessment in a data-poor environment.This paper examines innovation and knowledge generation processes and the supporting role of intellectual property rights (IPR) both for systematized investigative science and traditional community led activities. Options for protection of traditional knowledge and life materials and processes are suggested. It is suggested that the systematic and logical merging of ideas from conventions like TRIPs, convention of biodiversity (CBD), and union pour la protection des obtentitous vegetales (UPOV) can lead to the creation of harmonized provisions that could satisfy basic and minimum standards of IPR and societal ethics. The need for the unambiguous definition of discovery and invention in the granting of patents for biotechnological investigations is explored, as well as the issues of the establishment of prior art from unstructured traditional knowledge, identifying legal owners of traditional knowledge and evaluating prior art in this domain. The imperative task of creating a structured knowledge database of traditional practices and linking them through global networks is highlighted. The author also points to the fact that rigorous examination and search of patents in biotechnology is demanding ever greater levels of technical expertise and ultrahigh speed computing.Four case studies are presented to illustrate issues related to:•the erroneous granting of a patent and the role of documented community prior art in its revocation,•equitable sharing of benefits with indigenous tribes,•sharing of benefits with the community and•integrating indigenous knowledge, modern science and reciprocity into novel drug discovery.A comparison of the semi-arid cratonic regions of monsoon West Africa and South India reveals that while the former is typified by ‘ferruginous tropical soils’, the latter is extensively blanketed by soils exhibiting ‘fersiallitic’ properties, which are rare south of the Sahara. Such challenging differences can be understood taking into account the denudational history to explain the geography and properties of tropical soils.Ants are chemical factories, and among their more noticeable products are their venoms. Though many studies have addressed the properties and activities of ant venoms, basic venom-related physiological questions, such as how venom production and replacement may vary with age, are rarely addressed. The answers to these questions are fundamental to understanding the physiological capabilities of these organisms, as well as the parameters within which potential optimization of their investment in venom production must take place. The only previous investigation into venom production in ants found it to be limited to early life in workers of the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta (Haight and Tschinkel, 2003). Because similar studies have not been conducted for comparison, it is unclear whether or not this is a common physiological pattern in ants. As a parsimonious way to address this question, and, more generally, to increase the currently scant information available regarding the venom-producing capabilities of ants, the longevity, temporal polyethism, age-related venom production, and age-related venom replacement capabilities of workers of Jerdon’s jumping ant, Harpegnathos saltator were investigated. Longevity varied from 10\\xa0days to nearly 2\\xa0years, with a median lifespan of 206\\xa0days. Workers remained in the nest when young, transitioned to outside work (foraging) after 50\\xa0days of age, and reached a plateau in their tendency to be outside the nest at 74\\xa0days of age. They eclosed with empty venom sacs, filled them by about 57\\xa0days of age, and were able to replace venom at all three ages tested (though at a higher rate when aged 100\\xa0days than 30 and 206). So, venom-production ability is not limited to early life in H. saltator workers, and aspects of venom physiology and exploratory behavior appear to coincide in a manner likely to result in foraging efficiency benefits; venom sacs reach fullness around the age workers begin their foraging careers, and venom replacement rate is highest around the age workers become the most dedicated foragers.A study was undertaken to assess the contribution of bamboo to the vegetation structure, biomass productivity and nutrient cycling pattern in 15- and 20-year-old teak plantations in the Kariem-muriem Forest Range, Kerala, India. Based on the distribution pattern of bamboo colonised in these plantations, three types of site were recognised: site type A (bamboo-rich area), site type B (moderately bamboo-rich area) and site type C (bamboo-poor area). Density, basal area, number of culms per hectare, biomass, litter and net primary production of bamboo were greater in site type A than in site types B and C. While the soils of site types A and B were rich in potassium, those of site type C were rich in calcium. In addition to this, a negative correlation between above-ground biomass of bamboo and teak was recorded in site type A. In the case of teak, the rate of accumulation and the enrichment ratio of calcium were more than those of other elements. However, in bamboo, the enrichment ratio and accumulation rate of potassium were higher than in teak. The values for these parameters in bamboo were higher for potassium than for other elements. These results show that even from the nutrient conservation and cycling point of view, bamboo is a suitable species for site type A and teak is suitable for site types B and C. It is recommended that interplanting of bamboo in teak plantation, especially in areas like site types B and C, is not advisable. Instead, patch-planting may be more appropriate both to get better yield and to maintain ecosystem stability. It was also concluded that management of key elements of the ecosystem, such as potassium, is crucial for the stability of the ecosystem after disturbance or the conversion of natural forests into plantations.Bronger, A., Bruhn-Lobin, N. and Heinkele, Th., 1994.

In the present time, the economy of India is growing rapidly in a vibrant mode and an efficient way, which in turn demands huge uninterrupted energy supplies. The country\\'s energy needs are met mostly by the usage of fossil fuels and nearly 70% of electricity is generated from coal based power plants. In India, nearly 840 million people depend on traditional biomass to satisfy their energy necessities. Approximately 74 million rural people do not have access to modern lighting systems and around 81 million households do not have access to electricity, which is a major challenge to India\\'s energy security. In order to achieve stable sustainable energy in the long-run, significant progress in renewable energy sectors is needed. Favorably, due to India\\'s geographic location, the country is blessed with abundant renewable energy resources, which has not yet been exploited completely. So the central and state governments of the country have framed various policies and are providing subsidies to encourage the utilization of solar photovoltaic systems. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the potential, current developmental status and prospects of solar energy of India is briefed. The various applications of solar energy such as water heaters, desalination units, pasteurizers, food drying units, water purifier, space heating systems, air-conditioning units, cookers, water pumps, aerators, solar-wind hybrid systems and grid connected photovoltaic systems are explained. The study also mentions the current renewable energy policies, the barriers blocking the progress of the solar manufacturing units and some possible future recommendations that might speed up renewable energy developments in India.Bioenergy is the energy released from the reaction of organic carbon material with oxygen. The organic material derived from plants and animals is also referred to as biomass. Biomass is a flexible feedstock capable of conversion into solid, liquid and gaseous fuels by chemical and biological processes. These intermediate biofuels (such as methane gas, ethanol, charcoal) can be substituted for fossil based fuels. Wood and charcoal are important as household fuels and for small scale industries such as brick making, cashew processing etc. The scarcity of biofuels has far reaching implications on the environment. Hence, expansion of bioenergy systems could be influential in bettering both the socio-economic condition and the environment of the region. This paper examines the present role of biomass in the region’s (Uttara Kannada District, Karnataka State, India) energy supply and calculates the potential for future biomass provision and scope for conversion to both modern and traditional fuels. Based on the detailed investigation of biomass resource availability and demand, we can categorise the Uttara Kannada District into two zones (a) Biomass surplus zone consisting of Taluks mainly from hilly area (b) Biomass deficit zone, consisting of thickly populated coastal Taluks such as Bhatkal, Kumta, Ankola, Honnavar and Karwar. Fuel wood is mainly used for cooking and horticulture residues from coconut, arecanut trees are used for water heating purposes. Most of the households in this region still use traditional stoves where efficiency is less than 10%. The present inefficient fuel consumption could be brought down by the usage of fuel efficient stoves (a saving of the order of 27%). Availability of animal residues for biogas generation in Sirsi, Siddapur, Yellapur Taluks gives a viable alternative for cooking, lighting fuel and a useful fertiliser. However to support the present livestock population, fodder from agricultural residues is insufficient in these Taluks. There is a need to supplement the fodder availability with fodder crops as successfully tried in Banavasi village by some progressive farmers.r SummaryThis chapter describes various aspects of the numerical weather prediction in low latitudes. The scope of real-data numerical weather prediction efforts with regional and global models over the tropics is addressed. The regional prediction covers models based on simple conservation laws and more general primitive-equation models with detailed physical parameterization. The global model is a multilevel, high-resolution spectral model with detailed physics and initialization. In the tropical modeling effort, initialization appears to be necessary as retaining gravitational divergent modes—such as the Hadley–Walker—and storm-scale divergent circulations is required. The version of multilevel grid-point and global spectral models presented in the chapter includes a fairly sophisticated radiative parameterization. The various elements of this parameterization include the emissivity method for calculating long-wave radiation, the absorptivity method for calculating short-wave radiation, and energy balance at the earth\\'s surface.The use of herbal drugs for the prevention and treatment of various health ailments has been in practice from time immemorial. Generally it is believed that the risk associated with herbal drugs is very less, but reports on serious reactions are indicating to the need for development of effective marker systems for isolation and identification of the individual components. Standards for herbal drugs are being developed worldwide but as yet there is no common consensus as to how these should be adopted. Standardization, stability and quality control for herbal drugs are feasible, but difficult to accomplish. Further, the regulation of these drugs is not uniform across countries. There are variations in the methods used across medicine systems and countries in achieving stability and quality control. The present study attempts to identify the evolution of technical standards in manufacturing and the regulatory guideline development for commercialization of herbal drugs.Coffee is the world’s most valuable tropical export crop. Recent studies predict severe climate change impacts on Coffea arabica (C. arabica) production. However, quantitative production figures are necessary to provide coffee stakeholders and policy makers with evidence to justify immediate action. Using data from the northern Tanzanian highlands, we demonstrate for the first time that increasing night time (Tmin) temperature is the most significant climatic variable responsible for diminishing C. arabica yields between 1961 and 2012. Projecting this forward, every 1\\xa0°C rise in Tmin will result in annual yield losses of 137\\xa0±\\xa016.87\\xa0kg\\xa0ha−1 (P\\xa0=\\xa01.80e-10). According to our ARIMA model, average coffee production will drop to 145\\xa0±\\xa041\\xa0kg\\xa0ha−1 (P\\xa0=\\xa08.45e-09) by 2060. Consequently, without adequate adaptation strategies and/or substantial external inputs, coffee production will be severely reduced in the Tanzanian highlands in the near future. Attention should also be drawn to the arabica growing regions of Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ethiopia and Kenya, as substantiated time series evidence shows these areas have followed strikingly similar minimum temperature trends. This is the first study on coffee, globally, providing essential time series evidence that climate change has already had a negative impact on C. arabica yields.The population structure of Cirrhinus mrigala from different riverine locations in India was investigated using allozyme and microsatellite loci. C. mrigala samples were obtained from ten rivers belonging to Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra and Mahanadi basins. Seven (29.2%) out of 24 allozyme loci and seven microsatellite loci were polymorphic, including five from our earlier work. Significant deviation (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) from the Hardy–Weinberg expectations were evident for two allozyme loci: G6PDH⁎, XDH⁎, and two microsatellite loci: MFW17, R-12F, in different samples. Both markers types demonstrated concordant results and various estimates revealed genetic variability within the subpopulations but surprisingly low level (θ\\xa0=\\xa00.015 to 0.02) of genetic differentiation among C. mrigala from different river samples. AMOVA analysis also indicated low differentiation among subpopulations. Common ancestry in the prehistoric period and possible exchange of individuals between rivers in different river basins such as Indus and Ganges could have been responsible for the observed low level of genetic differentiation among wild mrigal populations.The amount of power available at a given site is decided by the volumetric flow of water and the hydraulic head or water pressure. In hydro schemes, the turbines that drive the electricity generators are directly powered either from a reservoir or the `run of the river\\'. The large schemes may include a water storage reservoir providing daily or seasonal storage to match the production with demand for electricity. These schemes have been producing power in Karnataka for many years, with the first hydroelectric station built in 1942. The majority of them are in Uttara Kannada district. Due to environmental constraints, further construction of storage reservoirs is limited and attention has been focussed towards developing environmental friendly small-scale hydro schemes to cater for the needs of the region. In this paper, the assessment of potential carried out in the streams of Bedthi and Aghnashini river basins in Uttara Kannada district of Western Ghats is discussed. Potentials at five feasible sites are assessed based on stream gauging carried out for a period of 18 months. Computations of discharge on empirical/rational method based on 90 years of precipitation data and the subsequent power and energy values computed are in conformity with the power calculations based on stream gauging. It is estimated that, if all streams are harnessed for energy, electricity generated would be in the order of 720 and 510 million units in Bedthi and Aghnashini basins, respectively. This exercise provides insight to meeting the regional energy requirement through integrated approaches, like harnessing hydro power in a decentralized way during the monsoon season, and meeting lean season requirements through small storage, solar or other thermal options. Net energy analyses incorporating biomass energy lost in submergence show that maximization in net energy at a site is possible, if the hydroelectric generation capacity is adjusted according to the seasonal variations in the river\\'s water discharge.Lymphatic filariasis is caused by three closely related nematode parasites: Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi and Brugia timori. These species have many ecological variants that differ in several aspects of their biology such as mosquito vector species, host range, periodicity, and morphology. Although the genome of B. malayi (the first genome sequenced from a parasitic nematode) has been available for more than five years, very little is known about genetic variability among the lymphatic dwelling filariae. The genetic diversity among these worms is not only interesting from a biological perspective, but it may have important practical implications for the Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis, as the parasites may respond differently to diagnostic tests and/or medical interventions. Therefore, better information on their genetic variability is urgently needed. With improved methods for nucleic acid extraction and recent advances in sequencing chemistry and instrumentation, this gap can be filled relatively inexpensively. Improved information on filarial genetic diversity may increase the chances of success for lymphatic filariasis elimination programs.The rising economic activities, growing population and improving living standards of world have led to a steady growth in its appetite for quality and quantity of energy services. As the economy expands the electricity demand is going to grow further, increasing the challenges of the more generation and stresses on the utility grids. Appropriate energy model will help in proper utilization of the locally available renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, biomass, small hydro etc. to integrate in the available grid, reducing the investments in energy infrastructure. Further to these new technologies like smart grids, decentralized energy planning, energy management practices, energy efficiency are emerging. In this paper the attempt has been made to study and review the recent energy planning models, energy forecasting models, and renewable energy integration models. Also various modeling techniques and tools are reviewed and discussed.Pogostemon (Lamiaceae; Lamioideae) sensu lato is a large genus consisting of about 80 species with a disjunct African/Asian distribution. The infrageneric taxonomy of the genus has historically been troublesome due to morphological variability and putative convergent evolution within the genus. Notably, some species of Pogostemon are obligately aquatic, perhaps the only Lamiaceae taxa which exhibit this trait. Phylogenetic analyses using the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and five plastid regions (matK, rbcL, rps16, trnH-psbA, trnL-F), confirmed the monophyly of Pogostemon and its sister relationship with the genus Anisomeles. Pogostemon was resolved into two major clades, and none of the three morphologically defined subgenera of Pogostemon were supported as monophyletic. Inflorescence type (spikes with more than two lateral branches vs. a single terminal spike, or rarely with two lateral branches) is phylogenetically informative and consistent with the two main clades we recovered. Accordingly, a new infrageneric classification of Pogostemon consisting of two subgenera is proposed. Molecular dating and biogeographic diversification analyses suggest that Pogostemon split from its sister genus in southern and southeast Asia in the early Miocene. The early strengthening of the Asia monsoon system that was triggered by the uplifting of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau may have played an important role in the subsequent diversification of the genus. In addition, our results suggest that transoceanic long-distance dispersal of Pogostemon from Asia to Africa occurred at least twice, once in the late Miocene and again during the late-Miocene/early-Pliocene.A large-size solar cooker for animal feed has been designed, developed and tested. The cooker employs locally available materials of low cost, e.g. pearl-millet husk and horse excreata. The commercial materials required for its fabrication are plain glass, mild steel angle and sheet, wood and aluminium sheet cooking utensils. The solar cooker is capable of boiling 10 kg of animal feed, sufficient for five cattle per day. The efficiency of the solar cooker is 21·8%. The cost of the cooker is only Rs 1200, which can be recovered in 0·45-1·36 years depending upon the fuel it replaces. The short payback periods suggest that the use of the solar cooker is economic. The use of the cooker will save a lot of firewood, cowdung cake and agricultural waste which are presently used for the boiling of animal feed.We aimed to clarify phylogenetic relationships within the pantropical genus Diospyros (Ebenaceae sensu lato), and ascertain biogeographical patterns in the New Caledonian endemic species. We used DNA sequences from eight plastid regions (rbcL, atpB, matK, ndhF, trnK intron, trnL intron, trnL-trnF spacer, and trnS-trnG spacer) and included 149 accessions representing 119 Diospyros species in our analysis. Results from this study confirmed the monophyly of Diospyros with good support and provided a clearer picture of the relationships within the genus than in previous studies. Evidence from phylogenetic analyses suggests that Diospyros colonized New Caledonia multiple times. The four lineages of Diospyros in New Caledonia also differ in their degree of diversification. The molecular data indicate that one lineage is paleoendemic and derived from an ancient Australian species. The other three lineages are more closely related to several Southeast Asian species; two of them are neoendemics, and one has radiated rapidly and recently.Pharmaceutical and personal care products are used extensively worldwide and their residues are frequently reported in aquatic environments. In this study, antiepileptic, antimicrobial and preservative compounds were analyzed in surface water and sediment from the Kaveri, Vellar and Tamiraparani rivers, and in the Pichavaram mangrove in India by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The mean concentration of carbamazepine recorded in the Kaveri River water (28.3\\xa0ng/L) was higher than in the other rivers and the mangrove. Because carbamazepine is used only in human drugs, this may reflect the relative contributions of human excretions/sewage in these rivers. The mean triclosan level in the Tamiraparani River (944\\xa0ng/L) was an order of magnitude greater than in the other water systems, and the concentrations at two of the sites reported here (3800–5160\\xa0ng/L) are, to our best knowledge, among the highest detected in surface waters. Sediment levels were, however, comparable with other sites. We conclude that industrial releases are likely major contributors of triclosan into this river system. Among parabens, ethyl paraben was predominantly observed. Hazard Quotients suggest greater environmental risks for triclosan than for carbamazepine and parabens. This is the first study on antiepileptic, antimicrobial and preservatives in rivers and mangroves from India.Weathering profiles developed on basalt substrate contain information relevant to climate, atmospheric composition and evolution, nutrient release into the hydrosphere, and understanding Martian regolith. In this study, the chemical compositions of two profiles developed on Deccan Trap basalt are examined. One is sub-Recent and has only progressed to a moderate degree of alteration (Chhindwara profile), whereas the other is ancient (Paleocene) and the degree of alteration is extreme (Bidar laterite). In an attempt to better quantify the chemical changes during incipient to intermediate weathering of mafic substrates, a new index is proposed: the mafic index of alteration (MIA). Similar to the chemical index of alteration (CIA), the MIA quantifies the net loss of the mobile major elements (Ca, Mg, Na, K\\xa0±\\xa0Fe) relative to the immobile major elements (Al\\xa0±\\xa0Fe). The redox-dependent weathering behaviour of Fe is factored into two separate arrangements of the MIA that apply to oxidative [MIA(O)] or reduced [MIA(R)] weathering. The MIA can be visualised in a variety of ternary diagrams in the Al–Fe–Mg–Ca–Na–K system. To chemically quantify the stages of advanced to extreme weathering, at which the MIA and CIA are ineffective, the SiO2 to (Al2O3\\xa0+\\xa0Fe2O3) mass ratio, based on the established Si–Al–Fe (SAF) ‘laterite’ ternary diagram, is used; we propose that this ratio be referred to as the ‘index of lateritisation’ (IOL).Major element chemical variations, as expressed by weathering indices, are used to relate the extent of weathering with the behaviour of trace elements (alkali, alkaline earth, rare earth, and Nb) in the profiles. During the early stages of basalt weathering, the mobile trace elements (Sr, Be, Li) are anti-correlated with the chemical weathering indices and thus released during these stages. By contrast, the monovalent elements (K, Rb, Cs, Tl), excluding Na and Li, appear to be associated with the pedogenetic clay minerals. Of these elements, those with the most similar ionic radii are closely related in their weathering behaviour. Fractionation of the REE (Sm/Nd, Eu/Eu*, Ce/Ce*) is evident during weathering of the basalt. The loss of Eu is linked with that of Sr, Ca, and Na and thus associated with plagioclase dissolution during the stages of incipient to intermediate weathering. The fractionation of Sm/Nd suggests that basaltic weathering products may not always preserve their parent rock ratio and, consequently, their Nd isotope composition over time.Finally, weathering in the sub-Recent profile is shown to have progressed across two lava flows, whose morphology initially controlled the extent of weathering. Certain compositional variations in the original flows (e.g., immobile element ratios) are preserved through the effects of chemical weathering and have the potential to influence mass balance calculations across the entire profile.Soil erosion is not only a geomorphological, but also a land degradation process that may cause environmental damage affecting people’s lives. This process is caused both by overland and subsurface flow. Over the last decades, most studies on soil erosion by water have focused on surface processes, such as sheet (interrill), rill and gully erosion, although subsurface erosion by soil piping has been reported to be a significant and widespread process. This paper presents a state of art regarding research on soil piping and addresses the main research gaps. Recent studies indicate that this process (1) occurs in almost all climatic zones and in the majority of soil types, (2) impacts landscape evolution by changing slope hydrology, slope stability and slope-channel coupling, (3) is controlled by various factors including climate and weather, soil properties, topography, land use and land management. These issues are illustrated with various case studies from around the world. However, the majority of the reviewed studies used surface methods for soil pipe detection, although soil piping is a subsurface process. Surface methods, such as geomorphological mapping, may underestimate the piping-affected area by 50%. Moreover, most studies are limited to few case studies without presenting thresholds for soil pipe development in different environments. Subsurface erosion by soil piping is not represented in currently used soil erosion models. Therefore more research is needed to better understand the morphology and connectivity of soil pipes, their subsurface catchments, as well as soil erosion rates by piping in different environments. Knowledge of thresholds that induce erosion in pipes and subsequent initiation of gullies may help to improve models of hillslope hydrology and soil erosion that include pipeflow and piping erosion. The investigation of soil piping also requires improved methods that allow to better predict pipe development and collapses, and thus to detect piping-affected areas. Studies dealing with effective prevention and control measures of soil piping are scarce. Addressing these research gaps will help to improve our insights into subsurface erosion by soil piping, and thus help to better understand landscape evolution and hillslope hydrology, as well as to develop and improve effective piping erosion control techniques and strategies.This paper focuses on landscapes experienced by tourists on package tours to India. It examines how structure and content of 13 package tours create landscape experiences for the mass tourist which have little coincidence with the experiential reality of India. In this case, package tours encapsulate the visitor in vehicles and hotels in isolation from authentic environmental stimuli. Tours also direct tourists toward northern cities at the expense of southern and rural culture realms. Modern urban settings overshadow traditional ones and itineraries stress monuments to the past over current, every-day events and activities. Thus the tourist on a package tour, although inside India, is rendered an outsider to Indianness.We studied the feeding, growth and reproductive behaviour of Papilio polytes (common mormon butterfly) on five different host plants, Murraya koenigii, Toddalia asiatica, Glycosmis pentaphylla, Aegle marmelos and Citrus medica. The growth rate of P. polytes was fastest on M. koenigii followed by T. asiatica, C. medica, G. pentaphylla and A. marmelos. We related this to the nutrient contexts of the five plants. The plants T. asiatica and C. medica had higher water contents, which influenced the growth rate of the insect. M. koenigii was found to contain rich quantities of carbohydrate. M. koenigii, T. asiatica and C. medica were also rich in protein when compared to A. marmelos and G. pentaphylla. Total amino acid levels were comparatively higher in M. koenigii, T. asiatica, C. medica rather than A. marmelos and G. pentaphylla.Mineral extraction is growing worldwide, generating serious social and environmental impacts, and in the process, sparking significant resistance. The present article provides the first overview of non-fuel mining conflicts in India. The analysis is based on 100 cases of conflicts that occurred between 1992 and 2014, which constitutes the most exhaustive database compiled to date. In each case, location, mineral extracted, actors involved, cited causes of protest, conflict duration and outcomes were recorded. We found that the commodity responsible for the most conflicts is sand, the extraction of which is widespread and often carried out illegally by small-scale actors near rivers. Resistance against metallic ore mining, in contrast, typically pits local populations against larger corporations. Most resistance movements are composed of subaltern rural and/or indigenous populations; very few national and international NGOs were found to be involved in local movements. The causes of such conflicts have largely been ecological and responsible for an undermining of local livelihoods. Mineral extraction is expected to increase in India over the next decade, and with it, the number of associated conflicts.Water use by eucalypts has received a lot of attention in tropical countries during the past decade because of the large-scale introduction of these trees for afforestation. Eucalyptus grandis, widely used as a plantation item in tropical southern India, is the subject of a detailed ecophysiological study in this paper. A 4-year-old coppiced plantation was used for measurements. Microclimate data collected above the canopy were used along with stomatal conductance measurements to estimate the transpirational water loss by the Penman-Monteith equation assuming a two-layer canopy model. Leaf photosynthesis was measured diurnally and seasonally to understand the limitations in photosynthesis in the field. Results show that the water loss from the plantation ranges between 2.5 and 6.5 mm day−1 depending on the season. When suitably extrapolated, this amounts to 1181 mm annually in the study location, where annual rainfall averages 1302 mm. The stomatal conductance measurements showed that the increase in atmospheric vapour pressure deficit induced stomatal closure. This was probably regulated by the leaf water potentials also. Based on the above results it is concluded that E. grandis need not be a high water consumer because of its good stomatal control of transpirational water loss, especially during the dry season when the atmospheric vapour pressure deficit is high. The photosynthesis measurements led to a conclusion that the dry period experienced in the study location does not seriously affect the photosynthetic rate of the trees on a leaf unit area basis.Individual-based forest models simulate forest dynamics on the basis of establishment, growth and death of individual trees. This paper attempts to review and compare two major types of individual-based forest models: growth-yield and gap models. Although the two types of models share some similar features, they differ in model structure and data requirements and play several complementary roles. Growth-yield models are used by foresters to assist timber production and evaluate growth and yield of one to several commercial timber species in managed forests, while gap models are generally developed by ecologists to explore ecological mechanisms and patterns of structure and functional dynamics in natural forest ecosystems. Site-specific environmental and species information is necessary for constructing growth-yield models while gap models require species-specific biological information of individual trees and site-specific environmental data. The growth-yield models are more diverse in terms of model structure. In contrast, gap models belong to the same genealogy and later gap models are ultimately derived from the earliest one although they may vary in detail. In the future, we expect to see more individual-based hybrid models which integrate gap models with growth-yield models and ecophysiological models. As computer technology advances explosively, individual-based models could be much more efficient and user-friendly. There have existed disproportionately few individual-based models for biodiverse forests such as evergreen tropical rain forests. Development of individual-based models for tropical rain forests is more challenging and is being stimulated by new international conservation efforts.This case study has been carried out as a comparison between two different land-use strategies for climate change mitigation, with possible application within the Clean Development Mechanisms. The benefits of afforestation for carbon sequestration versus for bioenergy production are compared in the context of development planning to meet increasing domestic and agricultural demand for electricity in Hosahalli village, Karnataka, India. One option is to increase the local biomass based electricity generation, requiring an increased biomass plantation area. This option is compared with fossil based electricity generation where the area is instead used for producing wood for non-energy purposes while also sequestering carbon in the soil and standing biomass. The different options have been assessed using the PRO-COMAP model. The ranking of the different options varies depending on the system boundaries and time period. Results indicate that, in the short term (30 years) perspective, the mitigation potential of the long rotation plantation is largest, followed by the short rotation plantation delivering wood for energy. The bioenergy option is however preferred if a long-term view is taken. Short rotation forests delivering wood for short-lived non-energy products have the smallest mitigation potential, unless a large share of the wood products are used for energy purposes (replacing fossil fuels) after having served their initial purpose. If managed in a sustainable manner all of these strategies can contribute to the improvement of the social and environmental situation of the local community.This study analyzed the energy and economics associated with cultivation of traditional and introduced crops in the mountains of the Central Himalaya, India. The production cost in terms of energy for introduced crops such as tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) cultivation was 90,358–320,516\\xa0MJ\\xa0ha−1 as compared to between 19,814 and 42,380\\xa0MJ\\xa0ha−1 for traditional crops within Himalayan agroecosystems. For the introduced crops, high energy and monetary input was associated with human labor, forest resources, chemical fertilizer and pesticides. However, energy threshold/projection for farmyard manure in traditional crop cultivation was 80–90% of the total energy cost, thus traditional crop cultivation was more efficient in energy and economics. During the study, the farm productivity of introduced crops cultivation declined with increasing years of cultivation. Consequently, the energy output from the system has been declining at the rate of −y20,598 to y20,748\\xa0MJ\\xa0ha−1\\xa0yr−1 for tomato and y12,072 to y15,056\\xa0MJ\\xa0ha−1\\xa0yr−1 for bell pepper under irrigated and rain-fed land use in the mountains, respectively. The comparative analysis on this paradigm shift indicates that more research is needed to support sustainable crop cultivation in the fragile Himalayan environment.Satellite L-band synthetic aperture radar backscatter data from 1996 and 2007 (from JERS-1 and ALOS PALSAR respectively), were used with field data collected in 2007 and a back-calibration method to produce biomass maps of a 15\\xa0000\\xa0km2 forest–savanna ecotone region of central Cameroon. The relationship between the radar backscatter and aboveground biomass (AGB) was strong (r2\\xa0=\\xa00.86 for ALOS HV to biomass plots, r2\\xa0=\\xa00.95 relating ALOS-derived biomass for 40 suspected unchanged regions to JERS-1 HH). The root mean square error (RMSE) associated with AGB estimation varied from ~\\xa025% for AGB\\xa0<\\xa0100\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−\\xa01 to ~\\xa040% for AGB\\xa0>\\xa0100\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha−\\xa01 for the ALOS HV data. Change detection showed a significant loss of AGB over high biomass forests, due to suspected deforestation and degradation, and significant biomass gains along the forest–savanna boundary, particularly in areas of low population density. Analysis of the errors involved showed that radar data can detect changes in broad AGB class in forest–savanna transition areas with an accuracy >\\xa095%. However, quantitative assessment of changes in AGB in Mg\\xa0ha−\\xa01 at a pixel level will require radar images from sensors with similar characteristics collecting data from the same season over multiple years.The habitat preferences of large and medium-sized mammals in the Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary were studied. Twenty-four species were recorded. Most prefer to live in specific forest types. In the case of primates, Macaca radiata was more abundant in forest plantations and in deciduous forests. Macaca silenus was cinfined to the evergreen forests alone. Presbytis entellus was more numerous in deciduous forests. Presbytis johni was more or less evenly distributed between the west coast tropical evergreen and moist deciduous forests. Herbivores and carnivores were most abundant in grasslands and in the Tectona grandis plantations.India has a diverse set of vegetation types ranging from tropical evergreen to dry deciduous. The phenology of these natural vegetation types is often controlled by climatic condition. Estimating phenological variables will help in understanding the response of tropical and subtropical vegetation to climate change. The study investigated the annual and inter-annual variation in vegetation phenology in India using satellite remote sensing. The study used time-series data of the only available satellite measured index of terrestrial chlorophyll content (MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index) from 2003 to 2007 at 4.6\\xa0km spatial resolution. A strong coincidence was observed with expected phenological pattern, in particular, in inter-annual and latitudinal variability of key phenological variables. For major natural vegetation type the onset of greenness had greater latitudinal variation compared to the end of senescence and there was a small or no leafless period. In the 2003–04 growing season a late start for the onset of greenness was detected at low-to-mid latitudes and it was attributed to the extreme cold weather during the early part of 2003. The length of growing season varied from east to west for the major cropping areas in the Indo-Gangetic plain, for both the first and second crops. For the first time, this study attempted to establish a broad regional phenological pattern for India using remotely sensed estimation of canopy chlorophyll content using five years of data. The overall patterns of phenological variables detected from this study broadly coincide with the pattern of natural vegetation phenology revealed in earlier community level studies. The results of this study suggest the need for an organised network combining ground and space observation which is at presently missing in India.Ethnopharmacological relevanceMajor research contributions in ethnopharmacology have generated vast amount of data associated with medicinal plants. Computerized databases facilitate data management and analysis making coherent information available to researchers, planners and other users. Web-based databases also facilitate knowledge transmission and feed the circle of information exchange between the ethnopharmacological studies and public audience. However, despite the development of many medicinal plant databases, a lack of uniformity is still discernible. Therefore, it calls for defining a common standard to achieve the common objectives of ethnopharmacology.Aim of the studyThe aim of the study is to review the diversity of approaches in storing ethnopharmacological information in databases and to provide some minimal standards for these databases.Materials and methodsSurvey for articles on medicinal plant databases was done on the Internet by using selective keywords. Grey literatures and printed materials were also searched for information. Listed resources were critically analyzed for their approaches in content type, focus area and software technology.ResultsNecessity for rapid incorporation of traditional knowledge by compiling primary data has been felt. While citation collection is common approach for information compilation, it could not fully assimilate local literatures which reflect traditional knowledge. Need for defining standards for systematic evaluation, checking quality and authenticity of the data is felt. Databases focussing on thematic areas, viz., traditional medicine system, regional aspect, disease and phytochemical information are analyzed. Issues pertaining to data standard, data linking and unique identification need to be addressed in addition to general issues like lack of update and sustainability. In the background of the present study, suggestions have been made on some minimum standards for development of medicinal plant database.ConclusionIn spite of variations in approaches, existence of many overlapping features indicates redundancy of resources and efforts. As the development of global data in a single database may not be possible in view of the culture-specific differences, efforts can be given to specific regional areas. Existing scenario calls for collaborative approach for defining a common standard in medicinal plant database for knowledge sharing and scientific advancement.We explore a model of utilization in a premarket economy of a biological resource population by a social group which is the sole owner of the resource. The group is assumed to be motivated to derive as large a harvest as possible while at the same time attempting to keep the risk of extinction of the resource population at a low level. It is shown that this can most likely be achieved through total protection of the resource population in parts of its range set aside as refugia. Many primitive societies indeed follow this strategy, which deserves to be given more serious attention as a tool for the management of renewable resources.Eight representatives spatially associated red and black soils in Purna valley from the semi-arid region of Central India were studied through mineralogical, micromorphological and geochemical investigations to infer pedogenic transformations during changing climatic phase. The morphology of soils showed that dissected alluvial plains over the basaltic landforms consists predominantly of dark reddish brown to dark yellowish brown soils with iron/calcium carbonate nodules (Typic Haplustepts), and lithological discontinuities (Typic Ustifluvents) whereas, pediplains and alluvial plains have clayey, dark brown, sodic, slickensided (Bss) horizons enriched with CaCO3 nodules (Typic Haplusterts). Buried Natrustalf on alluvial fans and floodplains has strong brown natric (Btn) horizons with distinct ferriargillans and abundant CaCO3 nodules. Ferriargillans in Alfisols indicates prevalence of humid climatic phase in the past during which alteration of plagioclase feldspars to smectites could have occurred, thereafter termination of humid phase and an onset of semi-arid climatic phase had favored drier non-leaching environment which has resulted in the preservation of smectites in Vertisols. The randomness in soils are expressed as entropy index which showed that physical mixing in subgroups of Vertisols and sodium enriched argrillic horizons in Alfisols were the indicators of altered pedogenesis at steady state. The formation of CaCO3 (pedogenic carbonates) and the concomitant development of sodicity during arid climatic phase were indicators of strong alkalinity and base accumulation in soils as a mark of aridity in red and black soils of the valley. The chemical index of alteration, weathering index, and entropy index were served as good indicators for assessing intensity of chemical weathering rate with respect to hydrology and topography. The study demonstrates that how the morphological, physical, chemical, mineralogical and micromorphological data were useful in assessing pedogenetic processes in spatially associated red and black soils of Purna valley.Orchids are among the most diverse of the flowering plant families, with over 800 described genera and 25,000 species. Orchids are prized for their beautiful long lasting flowers exhibiting an incredible range of diversity in size, shape and colour. Today growing orchids is more than just a hobby, it is an international business covering around 8% of the world floriculture trade and has the potential to alter the economic landscape of a country. Large-scale multiplication of exquisite and rare hybrids using tissue culture techniques has helped orchids occupy a position as one of the top ten cut flowers. As orchids are outbreeders, their propagation using seeds leads to the production of heterozygous plants. Hence, protocols providing regeneration from various vegetative parts of the plants are needed. Though orchid micropropagation has shown spectacular development in the recent years, the wide spread use of micropropagation is believed to be still limited due to problems like exudation of phenolics from explants, transplantation to field, somaclonal variation etc. We endeavour to include the major investigations on explant-based orchid tissue culture starting from the pioneering works of Rotor [Rotor, G., 1949. A method of vegetative propagation of Phalaenopsis species and hybrids. Am. Orchid Soc. Bull. 18, 738–739] followed by Morel [Morel, G., 1960. Producing virus-free cymbidiums. Am. Orchid Soc. Bull. 29, 495–497] and Wimber [Wimber, D.E., 1963. Clonal multiplication of cymbidiums through tissue culture of the shoot meristem. Am. Orchid Soc. Bull. 32, 105–107] to date.The transport of sediments by rivers to the oceans represents an important link between the terrestrial and marine ecosystem. Therefore, this work aims to study spatio-temporal variation of the sediment discharge and erosion rate in the Mahanadi river, one of the biggest rivers in India, over past three decades vis-à-vis their controlling factors. To understand the sediment load variation, the trend analysis in the time series data of rainfall, water and sediment discharge of the Mahanadi river were also attempted. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall and Sen\\'s methods were used to determine whether there was a positive or negative trend in the time series data with their statistical significance. The occurrence of abrupt changes was detected using Pettitt test. The trend test result represents that sediment load delivered from the Mahanadi river to the global ocean has decreased sharply at the rate of 0.515\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0tons/year between 1980 and 2010. Water discharge and rainfall in the basin showed no significant decreasing trend except at only one tributary. The decline in sediment discharge from the basin to the Bay of Bengal is mainly due to the increase in the number of dams, which has recorded the increase from 70 to 253 during the period of 1980 to 2010. Over the past 30\\xa0years the Mahanadi river has discharged about 49.0\\xa0±\\xa020.5\\xa0km3 of water and 17.4\\xa0±\\xa012.7\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0tons of sediment annually to the Bay of Bengal whereas the mean erosional rate is 265\\xa0±\\xa0125\\xa0tons/km2/year over the period of 30\\xa0years in the basin. Based on the current data (2000–2001 to 2009–2010), sediment flux and water discharge to the ocean are 12\\xa0±\\xa05\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0tons/year and 49\\xa0±\\xa016\\xa0km3/year respectively; and ranking Mahanadi river second in terms of water discharge and sediment flux to the ocean among the peninsular rivers in India.The “Kerala model of development” has won wide international attention for its achievements in regard to social development and, to a certain extent, environmental sustainability. The “old” Kerala model, preoccupied with redistributive policies, failed, however, to induce economic development. As a result, attention is now being given to a “new” Kerala model. The new policy explicitly seeks reconciliation of social, productive and environmental objectives at the local level, and tries to develop synergies between civil society, local governmental bodies and the state government. The new Kerala model thus holds important lessons for participatory, community-based sustainable development in India and elsewhere.We contribute to the debate on the social implications of carbon forestry projects by showing that tradeoffs exist between social benefits of projects and their cost-effectiveness. Large-scale industrial plantations and strict forest protection are economically viable, but pose the highest social risks. Socially beneficial projects are less cost-effective because of their higher transaction costs. Enabling policies are also required for their success. Regulation of carbon markets will therefore be required to reduce social risks and enhance benefits. We propose a number of regulatory and proactive measures and justify them on the basis of market imperfections and concepts of sustainable development.IGROSS (interconnected groundwater systems simulation) is an industrial system of digital programs specially designed for multiaquifer groundwater systems simulation, and is based on the quasi-three-dimensional finite-element (FE) approach. Lateral aquifer connections and an accurate aquifer balance method are introduced in the FE scheme. The numerical solution of the system of equations is based on the substructured frontal method integrated in the steady case with a forcing iterative procedure and in the transient case with a predictor-corrector procedure. The system of computer programs is modular and the different programs are linked by means of auxiliary data files.The model of the Western Libya groundwater system is presented as a relevant application of IGROSS. This aquifer system extends over 800,000 km2 and is composed of four aquifers hydraulically interconnected both along aquifer branchings and through interbedded aquitards. The FE grid network contains 4407 aquifer elements ranging from 3 to 3000 km2, 3104 aquitard elements and 62 aquifer branching nodes.The steady-state model calibration was made with reference to the natural state of the groundwater system prior to its modern development (year 1960), adjusting the aquifer transmissivity and the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquitards. The calibration error has been less than 1 m. The volumetric balance of the groundwater system has been performed. Transient model calibration was made by simulating the history of exploitation in the period 1960–1979. During the transient calibration the storage parameters of the aquifers and aquitard were adjusted.The most suitable future exploitation of the groundwater system has been selected among ten different exploitation hypotheses simulated over the period 1979–2030. It is concluded that IGROSS represents a useful tool for the effective management of large interconnected groundwater systems.When scientific forest management was introduced in India under British rule in the second half of the 19th century, it provoked great controversy. Intense discussion surrounded the effect fire had on sustainable forestry. Based upon a 2-year empirical survey in the Kadavakurichi Hillock area of the Dindigul District of Tamil Nadu, this paper revisits that earlier debate. The data show that despite shortcomings in tree growth, areas consisting predominantly of forests largely degraded by frequent fire can satisfy the needs of the local population. The various forms of land use practised in these areas are sustainable at low levels, particularly non-timber forest produce management. Statistical analysis and prognosis indicate that local forest use and management through frequent fire should be able to support this region\\'s livelihood under the prevailing poor environmental conditions as well as into the future. The positive aspects of the traditional fire management regime are discussed against the prevailing paradigm of fire prevention. for generating information on potential woody biomass productivities of tropical forest plantations is highlighted in this paper. Current rates of deforestation and reforestation, and features of plantation forestry in Brazil and India are presented. The plantation forest productivity in India is generally below 8 t/ha/yr while in Brazil it is higher than 10 t/ha/yr. A combination of factors, viz., quality of planting stock, nutrient supplements, and water application, are used to estimate potential and feasible productivities for semi-arid and sub-humid tropical regions. With no improvement in genetic stock and no supplements of water and nutrients, a productivity in the range of 2 to 5 t/ha/yr in semi-arid areas is estimated. With high-quality genetic planting material coupled with supplements of nutrients and water, a productivity in the range of 30 to 35 t/ha/yr could be expected in large-scale plantations.t is commonly accepted that forest plays role to modify the water cycle at the watershed scale. However, the impact of forest on aquifer recharge is still discussed: some studies indicate that infiltration is facilitated under forest while other studies suggest a decrease of recharge. This paper presents an estimate of recharge rates to groundwater in a humid forested watershed of India. Recharge estimates are based on the joint use of several methods: chloride mass balance, water table fluctuation, geophysics, groundwater chemistry and flow analysis. Two components of the recharge (direct and indirect) are estimated over 3 years of monitoring (2003–2006). The direct and localized recharges resulting from rainfall over the entire watershed surface area is estimated to 45\\xa0mm/yr while the indirect recharge occurring from the stream during flood events is estimated to 30\\xa0mm/yr for a 2\\xa0km-long stream. Calculated recharge rates, rainfall and runoff measurements are then combined in a water budget to estimate yearly evapotranspiration which ranges from 80% to 90% of the rainfall, i.e. 1050\\xa0mm/y as an average. This unexpected high value for a deciduous forest is nevertheless in agreement with the forest worldwide relationship between rainfall and evapotranspiration. The large evapotranspiration from the forest cover contributes to decrease the recharge rate which leads to a lowering of the water table. This is the reason why the stream is highly ephemeral.Worldwide, a disparity in utilization of wind resource is observed. Often, regions endowed with higher wind potential tend to receive fewer investments than those with lower potential. This study is aimed at identifying factors that result in such a skewed diffusion of wind power technology (WPT). These factors are identified by conducting a case study for a State in India - Maharashtra. The State is chosen as there is no correlation between wind potential in a district and corresponding WPT installed capacity. Only five districts (out of nine districts endowed with significant wind potential) comprising less than 50 per cent of the potential contribute more than 90 per cent of the capacity. Accordingly, this paper is an enquiry into role of local factors influencing the adoption of WPT. Five factors are identified through semi-structured interviews with six firms contributing to over 50 per cent of the installed capacity of WPT in Maharashtra. Subsequently, validation of the factors is carried out through econometric analysis using the data for nine districts of the state for the period 2006–2013. Results show that four factors – namely, geographical, technological, societal, and bureaucratic influence the decision of firms to invest in WPT.The bluegum (Eucalyptus globulus) has been widely grown in different parts of the world for multiple purposes. However, the possible adverse effect of converting natural forest watersheds into bluegum plantations on surface and sub-surface hydrology has been a major concern for researchers and planners. This paper critically evaluates the implications of coppiced bluegum plantations on hydrological behaviour during the 10 years of the second rotation using the paired watershed technique in a montane temperate humid climate. The coppiced bluegum growth (1982–91) on 59% of the catchment area reduced the mean annual total runoff by 25.4% and base flow by 27% over the natural grassland as compared with 16% and 15%, respectively, during the first rotation of 10 years. Regression relationships between observed and computed monthly values indicated a relatively higher reduction in the total as well as base flow during the first coppiced growth as compared with the first rotation. Reduction in runoff was at a maximum during July to October, which was ascribed to greater availability of rain water and hence its utilization during this period. The reduction during the dry period (January–April) is crucial for sustaining dry weather flow in the hydro-electric reservoirs. The increased utilization of water during the second rotation was as a result of the deep root system right from the earliest growth which produced 42% more biomass and 40% higher economic returns (at 1982–83 price level) than the first rotation. For the year following the harvest of bluegum trees of the first rotation, the hydrological behaviour was similar to the pre-treatment conditions. The maximum growth of the coppiced shoots height and diameter at breast height (DBH) was noticed during second to fifth year as compared with fourth year onward in the first rotation. Moisture extraction from deeper soil layers by coppice growth was significant (α=0.01) which was not true for the first rotation. Direct contact of tap roots with the ground water table was not observed during the second rotation even through an extensive network of lateral roots was present., popularly known as the “Queen of Spices,” has a checkered history, dating back to the Vedic period (ca. 3000 bc) and is among the ingredients poured into the sacrificial fire during the Hindu marriage. Today cardamom commands a leading position among the spices of immense commercial importance and is finding its way into the dietary habits of millions around the world, even among people on the European and North American continents, hitherto unaccustomed to its use. Cardamom use ranges from a simple dietary constituent to that of immense pharmacological benefits. Although beset with many problems, both agronomic and economic, it is a safe bet that next to black pepper, cardamom will emerge in the world market as a spice of immense commercial importance. Although India was the world leader in cardamom production, starting from the 1970s the country began to slide down both in production and productivity, while Guatemala, took the leading position, although the cardamom produced there is of inferior quality. Among the primary constraints of production, is the absence of an ideotype that combines many positive traits to boost production potential, while at the same time resisting the ravages of the devastating viral disease Katte of the Karnataka State in southern India. Fertility management of cardamom soils is still rooted in classic “textbook knowledge.” This exhaustive chapter covering many aspects of the agronomy and economy of cardamom production, has also a separate chapter on the relevance of “The Nutrient Buffer Power Concept,” developed by the author, in enhancing cardamom productivity. © 2006, Elsevier Inc.A molecular phylogenetic study of Durio s.lat. was conducted based on sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA for 30 ingroup exemplars, representing 16 species, and two taxa of Cullenia as outgroups. The phylogeny suggests the existence of two well-circumscribed clades composed, respectively, of species with poricidal pollen locules (Boschia) and species with pollen locules that open with longitudinal slits (Durio s.str.). The latter clade is subdivided into two strongly supported clades: /Tubulidurio, with highly fused filaments and free calyx lobes, and /Palatadurio, with largely free filaments and connate calyx lobes. We provide phylogenetic definitions for the names of these well-supported clades. Reconstruction of floral evolution is consistent with the hypothesis that vertebrate pollination is ancestral for Durio s.lat. and Cullenia. However, there have been further shifts in pollination system within Durio s.lat., which may account for some of the current diversity of floral characters. The correlation of fruit and aril characteristics suggests that there are two major dispersal syndromes, involving either birds (fruits opening on trees; aril red/yellow and odorless) or terrestrial mammals (fruits opening only after falling to the ground; aril pale colored and pungent). The distribution of extant taxa implies a Malesian origin and radiation of the study group, with a single dispersal of Cullenia to India and Sri Lanka. However, the fossil pollen record raises the possibility that Durio and relatives may have migrated to Southeast Asia from the Indian subcontinent after it collided with Asia. A molecular clock analysis suggests that the earliest divergence within the study group occurred about 20 to 32 mya and, hence, does not favor either biogeographic scenario.Environmental heterogeneity is considered to be one of the main factors associated with biodiversity given that areas with highly heterogeneous environments can host more species due to their higher number of available niches. In this view, spatial variability extracted from remotely sensed images has been used as a proxy of species diversity, as these data provide an inexpensive means of deriving environmental information for large areas in a consistent and regular manner. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the state of the art in the use of spectral heterogeneity for estimating species diversity. We will examine a number of issues related to this theme, dealing with: i) the main sensors used for biodiversity monitoring, ii) scale matching problems between remotely sensed and field diversity data, iii) spectral heterogeneity measurement techniques, iv) types of species taxonomic diversity measures and how they influence the relationship between spectral and species diversity, v) spectral versus genetic diversity, and vi) modeling procedures for relating spectral and species diversity. Our review suggests that remotely sensed spectral heterogeneity information provides a crucial baseline for rapid estimation or prediction of biodiversity attributes and hotspots in space and time.The pace of urbanisation in Ranchi is increasing since the Jharkhand state has been formed, hence a study was carried to find the status of groundwater quality in peri-urban agglomeration of Ranchi city. Samples were collected from 44 sites in monsoon season from rural, periurban, urban, industrial and commercial zones of the city. Along with the physico-chemical parameters they were also analysed for 10 heavy metals namely As, Mn, Ni, Se, Fe, Cu, Cd, Co, Cr and Pb in which except As, Mn, Ni and Se rest of the elements were below detection level. The concentrations (ppb) of highly toxic metals viz., As, Ni, Mn and Se ranged from 0.0 to 200, 0.0 to 80, 0.0 to 4200 and 30 to 140 respectively which are above the acceptable limits as per BIS/WHO standards for drinking purpose. ANOVA showed that pH, TDS, EC, Total alkalinity, Total hardness, Cl-, SO42-, F-, Na+ and Se showed significant variation at 0.05 significance level. Hydrochemistry was dominated by calcium, bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate in the study area. These facts are also supported by PCA and correlation. The order of relative abundance of the anions was Cl-> SO42->NO3->F->PO43- and for cations was Ca2+~Na+>Mg2+>K+. Zonal variation revealed that as compared to rural, peri-urban and urban zones, industrial and commercial zones had degraded water quality. As depicted from Water Quality Index (WQI) 80% of sampling locations have poor water quality, 7% very poor water quality, 4% unfit for drinking and only 9% out of the 44 sampling locations have good water quality. Health risk assessment signifies the probability of the noncarcinogenic effect due to the presence of arsenic and selenium as compared to carcinogenic effect is more for the residents of the study area.Parties negotiating the Kyoto Protocol recently agreed that Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) investments can include carbon sequestration projects in developing countries. However, guidelines for achieving the socio-economic and environmental objectives of the CDM, and other concerns with sinks projects, have yet to be elaborated. Independently of the Kyoto process, international efforts have advanced to define and certify sustainably managed forests through processes, such as that of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). In this paper, the FSC-US principles and criteria for sustainable forest management are evaluated in light of current concerns for guiding afforestation and reforestation projects in the CDM. It is found that the FSC criteria would help to meet some of the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol, including provisions to reduce the risk of premature carbon loss, and features that could somewhat lessen leakage of emissions outside the project area. Existing FSC monitoring and verification procedures provide some, but insufficient, overlap with expected requirements for measuring carbon stock changes. FSC principles and criteria articulate stringent guidelines for meeting environmental and social goals that reflect years of negotiations between environmental, timber, human rights and labor interests.Liana infestations can be a problem in forests managed for timber because lianas decrease rates of tree growth, damage tree boles, and inhibit tree regeneration. To determine the area from which lianas colonize tree crowns in a liana-rich moist lowland forest in a timber concession in the Department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, we described “liana sheds” of individual canopy trees (the area under the crown and beyond its margins from which lianas colonize trees). In the same area we tested the hypothesis that pre-logging cutting of lianas in a harvested tree’s liana shed reduces post-logging liana infestations. Prior to logging, 73% of 570 trees >10\\xa0cm in DBH representing 12 commercial species, carried at least one liana >2\\xa0cm DBH. Liana-infested trees hosted an average of 9.3 lianas (±0.45 S.E., range: 1–68). The mean area of the crown covered by lianas was 35% (±29.7 S.E.) but some trees (10%) were completely covered by lianas. “Liana shed areas” were a function of crown area and varied among tree species. Most lianas on trees were rooted below the crown of their host (90%); the number of lianas decreased with increasing distance from the crown edge, but lianas colonized trees from as far as 8\\xa0m beyond the crown. Overall, there was a significant reduction in the number of lianas in 22 felling gaps 8 months after logging where lianas were cut before logging compared with 22 control gaps. In control gaps, the majority of climbing lianas sprouted from the prostrate stems of fallen canopy lianas (81%), including 3.1\\xa0km/ha of stems that were rooted along the ground before logging. Liana regeneration in gaps after pre-logging liana cutting occurred mainly by stump sprouting (41%) and sprouting from prostrate stems (48%). Pre-felling liana cutting reduced liana cover in felling gaps by 9% only but reduced liana basal area by 69%. The results of this study suggest that tree crown area, shape, and height are among the most important factors determining the likelihood of liana colonization of canopy trees and that pre-logging liana cutting reduces post-logging liana proliferation in logging gaps.The production and marketing of non-timber goods (NTFP) and services gained importance in forest management as demand for these increased considerably. However, due to lack of relevant information on the level of output of non-timber products, its economic significance was seldom accounted for in the valuation of forests. Dry deciduous forests in India is one such typical case where forest valuation is yet to integrate the NTFP stock, widely used for subsistence and cash income. A detailed accounting of commercially valuable forest products harvested from dry deciduous forests of Eastern India was made to highlight the economic worth of forests and contribution of NTFPs. The net present value of revenues from NTFP was estimated to be US$ 1016 ha−1 in the coastal area and US$ 1348/ha in the inland area, which proved to be significantly higher than the returns from alternative land uses. Dry deciduous forests were estimated to have more value than had been assumed previously and compared favourably against potential timber revenue (US$ 268 ha−1). The result indicates the necessity of developing a new valuation protocol for use by forest managers while deciding conversion of forest lands for non-forestry purposes.he distribution and compositional changes of organic matter (OM) within the Godavari river system is increasingly influenced by reduced monsoon rainfall and an increased number of damming. To track these changes stable isotopes of organic carbon and concentrations of lignin phenols were analyzed in total suspended matter (TSM), sediments, agriculture soils and plants from Godavari basin. The results indicated that the upper tributaries drained heavier carbon (δ13Corg\\xa0=\\xa0−20.4\\xa0±\\xa02.2‰) than the lower tributaries (δ13Corg\\xa0=\\xa0−25.4\\xa0±\\xa01.5‰) owing to the regional vegetation in the upper to lower basins. OM originating from algae near dam impoundments was incorporated into TSM and sediment due to extreme drought condition. The organic carbon (OC) content was higher in TSM and in the sediment of the region after the middle reach dam (Sriram Sagar) than before (2.2\\xa0±\\xa01.6 vs. 1.0\\xa0±\\xa00.1% OC and 2.1\\xa0±\\xa02.3 vs. 0.6\\xa0±\\xa00.2% OC, respectively). The lignin yield (Λ8) was lower in TSM and in the sediment after the dam impoundment than before (0.37 vs. 1.94\\xa0mg/100\\xa0mg OC and 2.9\\xa0±\\xa01.1 vs. 5.4\\xa0±\\xa02.3\\xa0mg/100\\xa0mg OC, respectively) due to an increased contribution of lignin free OC from algae and degraded soil. Less rainfall and dam impoundments enhanced the fraction of labile OM from freshwater algae and an estuarine phytoplankton bloom in the study year. Our study is the first to document lignin fluxes from an Indian monsoonal river (Godavari). The flux of lignin phenols of 7.26\\xa0×\\xa0109\\xa0g\\xa0yr−1 is much lower than those of most world rivers except the rivers from polar arctic.To make mining activities more eco-friendly, it is important to conduct mining operations in a manner that is more environmentally friendly, economically feasible and socially acceptable. The volume of solid waste generated, including tailings from mineral processing activities, is one of the main pollution concerns in the mining industry. In the tiny state of Goa (India), it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space for dumping these huge volumes. And therefore ways of utilizing mine waste need to be found. This paper examines the suitability of these wastes for use in construction. Studies by others were reviewed where it was found that these wastes contain acid producing mineral phases and high concentrations of heavy metals. The presence of such concentrations can jeopardize the environment, if management of these wastes is not addressed with due consideration and care. Particle size classification on these wastes suggests that mine wastes contain coarse-grained rock, sand, silt and clays. A number of tests were then conducted on the aggregate part of mine wastes and the physico-mechanical properties were obtained. According to the results obtained the mean values of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of concrete cubes after 28 days of curing was found to be of the order of 21.93 and 19.91\\xa0MPa with mine aggregate and granite aggregate, respectively. Through toxicity leaching procedure tests the study also confirmed that the hydraulic binder arrests metal mobility from these wastes. This paper does not discuss the economic aspects as that was beyond the scope of the research. However, to some extent socio-economic perspective of mine waste utilization has been presented and discussed.Land-use history interacts with natural forces to influence the severity of disturbance events and the rate and nature of recovery processes in tropical forests. Although we are far from an integrated view of forest recovery processes, some generalizations can be made. Recovery of forest structure and composition is relatively rapid following disturbances that primarily impact forest canopies, such as hurricanes. Recovery is considerably slower following disturbances that heavily impact soils as well as aboveground vegetation, such as bulldozing, heavy or long-term grazing, and severe fires, often with long-lasting effects on species composition. The landscape matrix plays a critical role in local recovery processes. Proximity of disturbed areas to remnant forest patches promotes more rapid recovery, which depends heavily on seed dispersal. Recovery of aboveground biomass is constrained by soil fertility and texture across regions as well as across soil types within a region. Restoration of soil fertility may be a prerequisite for forest recovery on sites with severely degraded soils. Despite evidence of rapid forest recovery following large-scale deforestation, many degraded areas of today\\'s tropics will require human assistance to recover forest structure, species composition, and species interactions typical of mature tropical forests.This paper discusses the potential for the development of tourism in the State of Tamil Nadu, India. It argues that the State is rich in both natural and cultural resources but is lacking in infrastructure and a well-defined development strategy. A resource based and an urban based development strategy are discussed and it is suggested that the latter may have advantages for a developing area in the early stages of tourism involvement.Airborne particulate chemistry mostly governed by associated sources and apportionment of specific sources is extremely essential to delineate explicit control strategies. The present submission initially deals with the publications (1980s–2010s) of Indian origin which report regional heterogeneities of particulate concentrations with reference to associated species. Such meta-analyses clearly indicate the presence of reservoir of both primary and secondary aerosols in different geographical regions. Further, identification of specific signatory molecules for individual source category was also evaluated in terms of their scientific merit and repeatability. Source signatures mostly resemble international profile while, in selected cases lack appropriateness. In India, source apportionment (SA) of airborne particulates was initiated way back in 1985 through factor analysis, however, principal component analysis (PCA) shares a major proportion of applications (34%) followed by enrichment factor (EF, 27%), chemical mass balance (CMB, 15%) and positive matrix factorization (PMF, 9%). Mainstream SA analyses identify earth crust and road dust resuspensions (traced by Al, Ca, Fe, Na and Mg) as a principal source (6–73%) followed by vehicular emissions (traced by Fe, Cu, Pb, Cr, Ni, Mn, Ba and Zn; 5–65%), industrial emissions (traced by Co, Cr, Zn, V, Ni, Mn, Cd; 0–60%), fuel combustion (traced by K, NH4+, SO4−, As, Te, S, Mn; 4–42%), marine aerosols (traced by Na, Mg, K; 0–15%) and biomass/refuse burning (traced by Cd, V, K, Cr, As, TC, Na, K, NH4+, NO3−, OC; 1–42%). In most of the cases, temporal variations of individual source contribution for a specific geographic region exhibit radical heterogeneity possibly due to unscientific orientation of individual tracers for specific source and well exaggerated by methodological weakness, inappropriate sample size, implications of secondary aerosols and inadequate emission inventories. Conclusively, a number of challenging issues and specific recommendations have been included which need to be considered for a scientific apportionment of particulate sources in different geographical regions of India.Ethnopharmacological relevanceJammu & Kashmir (J&K) is a predominantly Himalayan state in the north-western part of India. It has three geographically distinct divisions viz., Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh, which are immensely rich in their biological and cultural diversity. Medicinal plants are an important element of indigenous medical system of the region. The main goal of the present article is to examine the use of ethnomedicinal plants in three divisions of J&K and to discuss cross-cultural consensus on the use of medicinal plants in these divisions. The article also discusses the gaps in the current state of knowledge on ethnomedicinal plants of the region and gives recommendations for the future studies.Materials and MethodsScientific literature on ethnomedicinal field studies conducted in J&K state of India available in the journals, edited books and other scientific databases viz., CAB international, DOAJ, Google Scholar, PubMed, Science direct, SciFinder, Scopus and Web of Science were searched. Only field based ethnomedicinal surveys from last four decades up to December 2013 reporting first hand information on the medicinal plants used to treat human health related ailments by indigenous communities of J&K were included in this study. Venn diagram was used to analyze the cross-cultural consensus on the use of ethnomedicinal plants in the three divisions of J&K.ResultsA total of 948 plant taxa (923 angiosperms, 12 gymnosperms and 13 pteridophytes) belonging to 129 families, 509 genera, 937 species and 11 varieties have so far been reported to have a traditional medicinal use by indigenous communities of J&K. Asteraceae (60 genera, 132 spp.) was the most frequently used family followed by Fabaceae (32 genera, 50 spp.) and Lamiaceae (27 genera, 55 spp.). 514, 415 and 397 medicinal plants were used in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh divisions, respectively. Sixty eight plant taxa were used in all the three divisions, whereas 95 plants were common between Ladakh and Jammu, 127 plants between Ladakh and Kashmir, and 216 plants between Jammu and Kashmir. Maximum numbers of plant taxa were used for treating dermatological problems (321), followed by cold, cough and throat related ailments (250), fever (224), joint and muscle related ailments (215), gastrointestinal disorders (210), urogenital ailments (199), respiratory ailments (151), body pain (135) and gynecological disorders (127).ConclusionsThis is the first study from the J&K state, which has examined the medicinal plant use in three divisions of J&K and discussed the promising medicinal plant species with cross-cultural consensus. The analysis of the data suggested that while large numbers of plants are used medicinally in each division, there is a low interregional consensus and high variation between medicinal plants used in these divisions, which is due to both cultural divergence as well as biological distinctness. The issues related to current status of knowledge on medicinal plants used by indigenous communities of J&K have been discussed and some recommendations have been made for future studies on medicinal plants in J&K region.Vegetation structure and bird communities were characterized for three early secondary forest habitats near the town of Sinje, Liberia, West Africa. The habitats included a current farm (CF), a farm that had undergone two years of regrowth (RF), and a farm that had undergone seven years of regrowth (OF). Comparisons of vegetation structure among the three habitats indicated that as regrowth proceeds vegetation becomes taller and fills in open spaces but does not become more dense. Bird community comparisons showed that total species, unique species, mean density, and species diversity increase with increased time of regrowth. Proportions of resident, regular, and irregular species did not differ among the three habitats. Most species in all habitats foraged in medium-high vegetation, were foliage gleaners, and used insects as food.Bird communities were most similar between the CF and RF habitats, and least similar between the CF and OF habitats. The Sinje bird communities were compared with those of three habitats in the Mt Nimba region of Liberia. There was considerable similarity between resident bird communities of the OF habitat and a Mt Nimba second-growth habitat of similar age, and also between the RF habitat and a Mt Nimba grassland habitat.Ecologically, most of the species in the Sinje habitats were generalists with the proportion of secondary forest specialists increasing with increased time of regrowth. Very few species of primary forest specialists occurred in the Sinje early regrowth habitats.We used the Ecopath with Ecosim software to develop a trophic mass-balance model of the eastern Great Australian Bight ecosystem, off southern Australia. Results provide an ecosystem perspective of Australia\\'s largest fishery, the South Australian sardine fishery, by placing its establishment and growth in the context of other dynamic changes in the ecosystem, including: the development of other fisheries; changing abundances of apex predator populations and oceanographic change. We investigated the potential impacts of the sardine fishery on high tropic level predators, particularly land-breeding seals and seabirds which may be suitable ecological performance indicators of ecosystem health. Results indicate that despite the rapid growth of the sardine fishery since 1991, there has likely been a negligible fishery impact on other modelled groups, suggesting that current levels of fishing effort are not impacting negatively on the broader ecosystem structure and function in the eastern Great Australian Bight. Results highlight the importance of small pelagic fish to higher trophic levels, the trophic changes that have resulted from loss and recovery of apex predator populations, and the potential pivotal role of cephalopod biomass in regulating ‘bottom-up’ trophic processes. The ability to resolve and attribute potential impacts from multiple fisheries, other human impacts and ecological change in this poorly understood region is highlighted by the study, and will be critical to ensure future ecologically sustainable development within the region.The aim of this study is to propose a method to assess the long-term chemical weathering mass balance for a regolith developed on a heterogeneous silicate substratum at the small experimental watershed scale by adopting a combined approach of geophysics, geochemistry and mineralogy. We initiated in 2003 a study of the steep climatic gradient and associated geomorphologic features of the edge of the rifted continental passive margin of the Karnataka Plateau, Peninsular India. In the transition sub-humid zone of this climatic gradient we have studied the pristine forested small watershed of Mule Hole (4.3\\xa0km2) mainly developed on gneissic substratum. Mineralogical, geochemical and geophysical investigations were carried out (i) in characteristic red soil profiles and (ii) in boreholes up to 60\\xa0m deep in order to take into account the effect of the weathering mantle roots. In addition, 12 Electrical Resistivity Tomography profiles (ERT), with an investigation depth of 30\\xa0m, were generated at the watershed scale to spatially characterize the information gathered in boreholes and soil profiles. The location of the ERT profiles is based on a previous electromagnetic survey, with an investigation depth of about 6\\xa0m. The soil cover thickness was inferred from the electromagnetic survey combined with a geological/pedological survey.Taking into account the parent rock heterogeneity, the degree of weathering of each of the regolith samples has been defined using both the mineralogical composition and the geochemical indices (Loss on Ignition, Weathering Index of Parker, Chemical Index of Alteration). Comparing these indices with electrical resistivity logs, it has been found that a value of 400\\xa0Ohm\\xa0m delineates clearly the parent rocks and the weathered materials. Then the 12 inverted ERT profiles were constrained with this value after verifying the uncertainty due to the inversion procedure. Synthetic models based on the field data were used for this purpose. The estimated average regolith thickness at the watershed scale is 17.2\\xa0m, including 15.2\\xa0m of saprolite and 2\\xa0m of soil cover.Finally, using these estimations of the thicknesses, the long-term mass balance is calculated for the average gneiss-derived saprolite and red soil. In the saprolite, the open-system mass-transport function τ indicates that all the major elements except Ca are depleted. The chlorite and biotite crystals, the chief sources for Mg (95%), Fe (84%), Mn (86%) and K (57%, biotite only), are the first to undergo weathering and the oligoclase crystals are relatively intact within the saprolite with a loss of only 18%. The Ca accumulation can be attributed to the precipitation of CaCO3 from the percolating solution due to the current and/or the paleoclimatic conditions. Overall, the most important losses occur for Si, Mg and Na with −286\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0mol/ha (62% of the total mass loss), −67\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0mol/ha (15% of the total mass loss) and −39\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0mol/ha (9% of the total mass loss), respectively. Al, Fe and K account for 7%, 4% and 3% of the total mass loss, respectively. In the red soil profiles, the open-system mass-transport functions point out that all major elements except Mn are depleted. Most of the oligoclase crystals have broken down with a loss of 90%. The most important losses occur for Si, Na and Mg with −55\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0mol/ha (47% of the total mass loss), −22\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0mol/ha (19% of the total mass loss) and −16\\xa0×\\xa0106\\xa0mol/ha (14% of the total mass loss), respectively. Ca, Al, K and Fe account for 8%, 6%, 4% and 2% of the total mass loss, respectively.Overall these findings confirm the immaturity of the saprolite at the watershed scale. The soil profiles are more evolved than saprolite but still contain primary minerals that can further undergo weathering and hence consume atmospheric CO2.Wiesneria triandra (Dalzell) Micheli is a phylogenetically isolated, local, endemic species of southwest India. It is annual and very sporadic in occurrence but when it is found it is often locally abundant. The inflorescences have mostly unisexual flowers with females borne below the males. Experiments have shown W. triandra to be amphimictic and self-compatible. Pollination can take place without a biotic vector. It is likely that it is highly inbreeding in spite of having unisexual flowers. The nutlets are very hard and have lateral gas-filled invaginations which provide short-lived buoyancy. The seeds have a dormancy induced by the testa (or perhaps the pericarp) which can be broken by mechanical, physical and chemical scarification. Dormancy is an important survival strategy, preventing seeds from germinating after showers during the dry season. The nutlets are dispersed over short distances by water. A mechanism for dispersal over long distances is unknown; the nutlets are digested by Anas platyrhynchos L. and are unlikely to be carried externally on water birds because they are hydrophobic, globose and rather heavy. Germination is typical for the family (with ‘Haarkranz’ and suppressed primary root) except that the hypocotyl emerges through a clearly demarcated cap. Plants growing in and out of water show a marked heteroblastic leaf development, the ‘juvenile’ leaves are strap-shaped while the ‘mature’ leaves are clearly differentiated into petiole and blade. In 1993 we were able to study two populations. Although the two populations were about 160 km apart, no convincing inter- or intra-population variation was detected using morphological characters and eight isozyme systems. Today, W. triandra is found only in habitats modified or maintained by man; the original habitat is discussed. Although rare it is not threatened with immediate extinction but is very susceptible to change in land usage and should be placed in the ‘vulnerable’ category.Detrital dynamics and microbial nutrient flux due to disturbances such as treefall and tree cutting were studied in a subtropical Pinus kesiya Royle Ex. Gordon forest in north-east India. Disturbance has substantially altered community structure, and therefore soil nutrient status. Natural gap formation has not resulted in significant changes in dry matter, C and N accumulation in litter and fine roots, or in microbial nutrient concentrations. However, there was a significant reduction in all functional parameters in the selectively logged site and soil heap. Soil microbial C, N and P were maximum in the understorey and minimun in the heap. Fine roots and microbial biomass contributed more to nutrient recycling in the ecosystem. N-mineralization was generally higher in the disturbed sites.The black inch worm, Hyposidra talaca (Walker) (Geometridae: Lepidoptera) has earned considerable importance as a defoliator during last decade in north east India. Characteristic features of H. talaca, such as switching from wild plants to Camellia sinensis, and completion of 6–8 generations in a year without winter diapause appear to be the major reasons for persistence of the defoliator on C. sinensis. There are reports on the aggressive infestation of the pest on C. sinensis than on alternate host plants and development of high tolerance/resistance to certain insecticides. Till date, more than one hundred alternate host plants have been recorded for H. talaca, but with very few natural enemies. To manage this pest chemically, synthetic pesticides are widely used. Integrated management is recently being encouraged wherein cultural, mechanical, physical, biological and chemical methods have been contemplated. This review collates the work and literature on the ecology of H. talaca and offers an analysis of the problems encountered in managing the defoliator in tea plantations. Further, future directions for better management of H. talaca are suggested.Management of natural forests might be one option to reduce the high deforestation rate in Ecuador. We therefore evaluated the response of water and nutrient cycles in a natural tropical montane forest to improvement fellings with the aim of favoring economically valuable target trees which will later be harvested with additional ecosystem impacts not considered here.The study was conducted at ca. 1900–2200\\xa0m above sea level in the south Ecuadorian Andes on the east-exposed slope of the east cordillera. In June 2004, one of two paired ca. 10-ha large catchments was thinned by felling 10.2% of the initial basal area (dbh\\xa0≥\\xa010\\xa0cm) on 30% of the catchment. The stems remained in situ. We measured ecosystem fluxes from rainfall via throughfall and stemflow to soil solution (litter leachate, soil solution at 15 and 30\\xa0cm depth) and stream flow between May 2004 and May 2005. After the fellings, soil solutions were extracted from the gaps created by the felled trees and the forest next to the gaps. We determined aboveground water fluxes by direct measurement and soil water fluxes with a budget approach. In the solutions, we measured concentrations of NH4+-N, NO3−-N, total dissolved N, PO43−-P, total dissolved P, Ca, Mg, K, Na, and Cl−. Fluxes were calculated as volume-weighted mean (vwm) concentrations times water fluxes. Dry deposition was estimated using Cl− as inert tracer.The fellings increased concentrations of N, K, Ca, and Mg in the organic layer of the resulting gaps compared with the forest next to the gaps (vwm concentrations of N: 6.4\\xa0mg\\xa0l−1 in the forest next to the gap/8.7\\xa0mg\\xa0l−1 in the gaps, K: 9.8/11, Mg: 1.8/3.0, Ca: 3.4/5.8). Lower nutrient concentrations and fluxes in the mineral soil of the gaps than in forest next to the gaps suggested that these nutrients were taken up by ground vegetation and target trees. The paired modified and undisturbed catchments had similar water and nutrient budgets. The fellings did not have a significant impact on the water and nutrient budget at the catchment scale.Since the early 1980s several new approaches towards forest management, which include active participation of local communities, have been tried out in many tropical regions. As a result of these efforts recognition has increased about the various ways in which many local communities are already actively managing their forest resources. The planning of development interventions to stimulate more efficient community involvement in forest management can often be based on such indigenous forest management systems. This paper aims to improve the understanding about the diversity and dynamics of indigenous forest management. The analysis consists of three parts. First an overview of the various types of indigenous forest management and their dynamics is presented. Subsequently, the basic principles of forest management are discussed. Forest management is characterized as involving a set of both technical activities and social arrangements for the protection and utilization of forest resources and the distribution of forest products. Three major categories of forest management practices are identified, e.g. controlled utilization of forest products, protection and maintenance of forest stands, and purposeful regeneration. The practices in the first category are both socially and biologically oriented, whereas the activities of the last two categories are biologically oriented. These principles are then used to develop a classification model of the various evolutionary phases in forest management. Along the lines of a similar model developed for exploitation of agricultural crops, various stages of forest management are distinguished along a gradient of increasing input of human energy per unit of exploited forest. This gradient represents a continuum of forest-people interactions; it illustrates how the various manifestations of indigenous forest management may be arranged along a nature-culture continuum.The genus Artocarpus (Moraceae) comprises about 50 species of evergreen and deciduous trees. Economically, the genus is of appreciable importance as a source of edible fruit, yield fairly good timber and is widely used in folk medicines. The aim of the present review is to present comprehensive information of the chemical constituents, biological and pharmacological research on Artocarpus which will be presented and critically evaluated. The close connection between traditional and modern sources for ethnopharmacological uses of Artocarpus species, especially for treatment against inflammation, malarial fever, diarrhoea, diabetes and tapeworm infection. Artocarpus species are rich in phenolic compounds including flavonoids, stilbenoids, arylbenzofurons and Jacalin, a lectin. The extracts and metabolites of Artocarpus particularly those from leaves, bark, stem and fruit possess several useful bioactive compounds and recently additional data are available on exploitation of these compounds in the various biological activities including antibacterial, antitubercular, antiviral, antifungal, antiplatelet, antiarthritic, tyrosinase inhibitory and cytotoxicity. Several pharmacological studies of the natural products from Artocarpus have conclusively established their mode of action in treatment of various diseases and other health benefits. Jacalin, a lectin present in seeds of this plant has a wide range of activities. Strong interdisciplinary programmes that incorporate conventional and new technologies will be critical for the future development of Artocarpus as a promising source of medicinal products. In the present review, attempts on the important findings have been made on identification; synthesis and bioactivity of metabolites present in Artocarpus which have been highlighted along with the current trends in research on Artocarpus.The study focuses on the assessment of inherent vulnerability of rural communities in Kimsar region to environmental hazards. A new conceptual framework was developed and hazard generic socio-economic indicators were identified in the assessment of inherent vulnerability of the communities to future harm. All the households from the selected villages were surveyed to collect information on the identified indicators. These indicators captured eight sub-components of inherent vulnerability, which includes lack of access to water, shelter, information, and connectivity, economic capacity, dependence on environmental resources, marginalised communities and gender. An Inherent Vulnerability Score (IVS) was computed, for each of the twelve villages by aggregating the data into a composite score. Sensitivity analysis was conducted for the composite score. The results obtained from a cluster analysis on the same village-level data were consistent with the IVS. Based on the results of cluster analysis, the villages were classified into three vulnerability groups ─ high, moderate and low. Access to water, dependence on environmental resources and shelter were found to be the most important determinants of inherent vulnerability in the region. Knowledge of inherent vulnerability will aid decision-makers to formulate policies, which will reduce vulnerability and help in rational distribution of resources among various communities.The altitudes of the ecotones between the main vegetation-zones up mountains of the humid tropics are reviewed, with emphasis on floristics and those areas with which the author is personally familiar. A detailed comparison is made of the zonation on Mt Kinabalu (c. 6°N) and the Himalaya of Bhutan (c. 27°N), and is supported by information from other parts of SE Asia, and to a decreasing extent South America and Africa. The relationship between forest-types based on structure and physiognomy and forest-types based on floristics is complicated. In SE Asia lower montane forests may be dominated by dipterocarps or an ‘oak-laurel’ assemblage. The dominant leaf size in both is notophyll, but the oak-laurel assemblage shifts to the microphyll size-class in China where the transition from tropical lower montane to warm temperate lowland forest begins. The opposite trend is seen where the lower montane flora of Papua New Guinea corresponds to the lowland flora in NE Australia. There are only modest changes between the Equator and the Tropic in the altitudes at which major transitions occur. It is concluded that soil changes, mediated only in part by temperature and associated climatic factors, may play a more direct and diverse role than has previously been indicated. The soil factors emphasized are the increase in organic matter content in lower montane soils as opposed to lowland, accompanied by a change from termite-dominance to earthworm-dominance, and the frequent occurrence of a dense moss layer and mor humus in upper montane soils. The case is made particularly by reference to east Asian mountains, which have been the most studied.There are several contentious issues related to forestry mitigation projects. The special report of the IPCC and literature published so far have shown that permanence, leakage, baseline establishment, measurement, monitoring, etc., could be addressed satisfactorily using existing scientific methods and accounting rules. To understand the methodological issues of developing community forestry projects, a case study was conducted in Mancherial forest division of Adilabad district in Andhra Pradesh, India. This paper addresses: the setting of project boundaries, baseline selection, establishment of additionality and the calculation of carbon sequestration as a result of the project, prior to project implementation. The steps involved in development of the project and the different methods used for establishing baseline, estimating leakage and transaction cost of developing a community forestry project are presented. The stock is projected to increase by 1480\\xa0×\\xa0103\\xa0t C during 2000–2012 over the baseline scenario under the modeling approach and the cost of establishing a baseline and project formulation for a project extending over 32,956\\xa0ha is estimated to be US$ 1.25\\xa0ha−1 and US$ 4\\xa0t C−1.Sustainable agriculture is vital in today\\'s world as it offers the potential to meet our agricultural needs, something that conventional agriculture fails to do. This type of agriculture uses a special farming technique wherein the environmental resources can be fully utilized and at the same time ensuring that no harm was done to it. Thus the technique is environment friendly and ensures safe and healthy agricultural products. Microbial populations are instrumental to fundamental processes that drive stability and productivity of agro-ecosystems. Several investigations addressed at improving understanding of the diversity, dynamics and importance of soil microbial communities and their beneficial and co-operative roles in agricultural productivity. However, in this review we describe only the contributions of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and cyanobacteria in safe and sustainable agriculture development.The phylogenetic relationships of microhylid frogs are poorly understood. The first molecular phylogeny for continental African microhylids is presented, including representatives of all subfamilies, six of the eight genera, and the enigmatic hemisotid Hemisus. Mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA sequence data were analysed using parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian methods. Analyses of the data are consistent with the monophyly of all sampled subfamilies and genera. Hemisus does not nest within either brevicipitines or non-brevicipitines. It is possibly the sister group to brevicipitines, in which case brevicipitines might not be microhylids. Phrynomantis and Hoplophryne potentially group with non-African, non-brevicipitine microhylids, in agreement with recent morphological and molecular data. Within brevicipitines, Breviceps is recovered as the sister group to a clade of Callulina+Spelaeophryne+Probreviceps. The relationships among the genera within this latter clade are unclear, being sensitive to the method of analysis. Optimal trees suggest the Probreviceps macrodactylus subspecies complex might be paraphyletic with respect to P. uluguruensis, corroborating preliminary morphological studies indicating that P. m. rungwensis may be a distinct species. P. m. loveridgei may be paraphyletic with respect to P. m. macrodactylus, though this is not strongly supported. Some biogeographic hypotheses are examined in light of these findings.Concentrations of major ions, Sr and 87Sr/86Sr have been measured in the Gomti, the Son and the Yamuna, tributaries of the Ganga draining its peninsular and plain sub-basins to determine their contribution to the water chemistry of the Ganga and silicate and carbonate erosion of the Ganga basin. The results show high concentrations of Na and Sr in the Gomti, the Yamuna and the Ganga (at Varanasi) with much of the Na in excess of Cl. The use of this ‘excess Na’ (Na∗\\xa0=\\xa0Nariv\\xa0−\\xa0Clriv) a common index of silicate weathering yield values of ∼18\\xa0tons\\xa0km−2\\xa0yr−1 for silicate erosion rate (SER) in the Gomti and the Yamuna basins. There are however, indications that part of this Na∗ can be from saline/alkaline soils abundant in their basins, raising questions about its use as a proxy to determine SER of the Ganga plain. Independent estimation of SER based on dissolved Si as a proxy give an average value of ∼5\\xa0tons\\xa0km−2\\xa0yr−1 for the peninsular and the plain drainages, several times lower than that derived using Na∗. The major source of uncertainty in this estimate is the potential removal of Si from rivers by biological and chemical processes. The Si based SER and CER (carbonate erosion rate) are also much lower than that in the Himalayan sub-basin of the Ganga. The lower relief, runoff and physical erosion in the peninsular and the plain basins relative to the Himalayan sub-basin and calcite precipitation in them all could be contributing to their lower erosion rates.Budget calculations show that the Yamuna, the Son and Gomti together account for ∼75% Na, 41% Mg and ∼53% Sr and 87Sr of their supply to the Ganga from its major tributaries, with the Yamuna dominating the contribution. The results highlight the important role of the plain and peninsular sub-basins in determining the solute and Sr isotope budgets of the Ganga. The study also shows that the anthropogenic contribution accounts for ⩽10% of the major ion fluxes of the Ganga at Rajmahal during high river stages (October). The impact of both saline/alkaline soils and anthropogenic sources on the major ion abundances of the Ganga is minimum during its peak flow and therefore the SER and CO2 consumption rates of the river is best determined during this period.The complex and dynamic nature of the coastal and marine area is prompting many nations to consider the internalisation of integrated coastal management (ICM) policy as part of a deliberate strategy for sustainable development. The institutional structures required to deliver such internalisation are subject to debate. This paper presents a suggested generic institutional framework derived through consideration of the core ICM process and proven organisational models. The proposed framework consists of an ‘operating core’ which facilitates local issue identification, evaluation and monitoring; an ‘administrative component’ of Central and State government to set policy direction, manage funding, and provide guidance on implementation and operation; a ‘strategic apex’ within Central government to oversee the transition from ICM concept to practice; and a ‘co-ordinating mechanism’ to allow open communication of ideas and information. The proposed framework is then applied to India, which currently faces the challenge of developing a suitable institutional framework to deliver ICM aspirations. It is concluded that the generic institutional framework works well when applied to India, with existing organisations and agencies requiring relatively minor organisational changes to address coastal and marine issues more effectively.Until now, phylogenetic studies of the mongooses (Carnivora, Herpestidae) have not included an exhaustive sampling of the Asian members of this family. In this study, we used mitochondrial (Cytochrome b and ND2), nuclear (β-fibrinogen intron 7 and Transthyretin intron 1) sequences from almost all of the recognized mongoose species to produce a well-resolved phylogeny of the Herpestidae. We also performed molecular dating analyses to infer divergence dates of the different lineages within the Herpestidae. Our results confirmed the paraphyly of the Herpestes genus and other phylogenetic relationships, which previously had only been moderately supported. The Asian herpestid species were found to form a monophyletic group within the Herpestidae. Within the Asian species, a cyto-nuclear conflict was discovered between the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus), the Indian gray mongoose (Herpestes edwardsii) and the Javan mongoose (Herpestes javanicus), which may have occurred through interspecific hybridization. This study inferred an Early Miocene origin for the Herpestidae and a Middle Miocene origin for the Asian mongooses.Earthworm biodiversity is modified when forests and natural savannas are replaced by agroecosystems; these changes can be studied from the taxonomic and functional point of view. In the first case the number and origin (native or exotic) of species is important, as well as the geographic scale of the study (local or regional). The functional approach considers the ecological groups (epigeic, endogeic, anecic), which have different effects on soil function. Studies in Mexico, Peru and India reveal that agroecosystem earthworm communities (as compared with those in the undisturbed ecosystem) have lower species richness, lower number of native species, lower number of ecological groups and a predominance of endogeics. Therefore the role of endogeic species in intensifying agroecosystems is likely to be more important for soil function, especially because they act as ecosystem engineers and through their mutualistic interactions with microflora, selective ingestion of soil particles, high rates of ingestion and production of casts, galleries, burrows and chambers can affect nutrient and organic matter dynamics and other pedological processes. Epigeic and anecic species do not appear to be as widespread in agricultural systems and their dependence on a litter layer for survival implies that litter management practices must be implemented for their role in soil function to be of importance.The role of earthworms in enhancing primary production depends on the synlocalization (in the same place) and the synchronization (at the same time) of their activities with the period and the sphere of active root growth and nutrient demands. Several field studies have found significant yield increases with earthworm inoculation, though more research is needed. Incorporation of information on earthworm life histories, field population variations, ecological strategies and short and long term effects on soil properties, in addition to plant and environmental factors (climate, soil, cropping period and management of the agroecosystem), are essential to properly assess the potential role of a particular earthworm species on plant production.Future research must focus on describing the role of native species and their interaction with or replacement by exotic species (belonging to the same or to a different ecological group) in soil function and agroecosystem productivity.In the present paper the author aims to define the main goals of a modern forest policy for environment. The attributes of the forest ecosystem, particularly its productivity, stability, complexity, nutrient cycling and ability to protect the environment are described. The influence of forests on environmental quality is discussed at global and local levels, together with the role of forests as a habitat for wildlife. Forests have an impact on the most Important properties of the earth\\'s surface which influence climate and which are likely to be affected by human activities. Such properties are earth reflectivity, heat absorption capacity and conductivity, regulation of water and dust control, emissivlty of the infrared band and amount of heat released to the ground. Specific references are made to physio-chemical, mechanical and psychological Influences of the forest at the local level. The author concludes by emphasizing some international aspects of pollution and the role of international cooperation In this respect.Dendrocalamus strictus and Bambusa arundinacea are monocarpic, gregariously flowering species of bamboo, common in the deciduous forests of the State of Karnataka in India. Their populations have significantly declined, especially since the last flowering. This decline parellels increasing incidence of grazing, fire and extraction in recent decades. Results of an experiment in which the intensities of grazing and fire were varied, indicate that while grazing significantly depresses the survival of seedlings and the recruitment of new culms of bamboo clumps, fire appeared to enhance seedling survival, presumably by reducing competition of less fire-resistant species. New shoots of bamboo are destroyed by insects and a variety of herbivorous mammals. In areas of intense herbivore pressure, a bamboo clump initiates the production of a much larger number of new culms, but results in many fewer and shorter intact culms. Extraction renders the new shoots more susceptible to herbivore pressure by removal of the protective covering of branches at the base of a bamboo clump. Hence, regular and extensive extraction by the paper mills in conjunction with intense grazing pressure strongly depresses the addition of new culms to bamboo clumps. Regulation of grazing in the forest by domestic livestock along with maintenance of the cover at the base of the clumps by extracting the culms at a higher level should reduce the rate of decline of the bamboo stocks.his study in the Hariyali sacred landscape (Garhwal Himalaya, India) was undertaken to evaluate the impact of ecosystem type, quality of organic inputs and water management on diversity and abundance of earthworms. A total of seven species viz., moniligastrid Drawida nepalensis (Michaelsen), lumbricid Allolobophora parva (Eisen), megascolecid Eutyphoeus sp. (near Eutyphoeus pharpingianus), octochaetid Octochaetona beatrix (Beddard), megascolecid Periyonx sp., octochaetid Lennogaster pusillus (Stephenson) and megascolecid Amynthas corticis (Baird), belonging to four families were found in the landscape. D. nepalensis had the widest distribution. Eutyphoeus sp., A. parva and Periyonx sp. were found only in forest ecosystems and L. pusillus and A. corticis only in agroecosystems. Total density of earthworms was highest under pine forest and species richness was greatest under the broad-leaved forest. Density and biomass of D. nepalensis and L. pusillus varied significantly between different years of cropping under rainfed agriculture receiving oak based or pine based organic inputs. Forest ecosystems had a mixed population of endemic and exotic species, whereas in agroecosystems endemics dominated. Epigeic species were the dominant functional group under broad-leaved forest and pine – broad-leaved mixed forests, whilst endogeic species were dominant under the pine forest. Irrigated agroecosystems receiving oak-based as well as pine-based organic inputs supported only endogeics, whereas both endogeic and epi-anecic species were observed in rainfed agroecosystems. This suggests that distribution of functional groups is determined by land use practices. Eutyphoeus sp. was the only species that showed a significant positive correlation with moisture and a negative correlation with pH and organic carbon. D. nepalensis and A. parva occurred under forest ecosystems and showed a significant positive correlation with lignin and C/N ratio, and a negative correlation with litter polyphenol concentration. Soil parameters and FYM-characteristics did not show any significant correlation with species occurring under agroecosystems. D. nepalensis, which is an endogeic but with a wide ecological amplitude, and the epigeic A. parva, present in large numbers in pine forest, are the two species which could be promoted for inoculation into litter-FYM based organic residue management pits.Global data sets of serious agricultural weeds (1348 species), widespread agricultural weeds (1041 species), and threatening natural area invaders (381 species) were assembled, and taxonomic patterns among these data sets were compared to gain insights into how these groups differ ecologically. Angiosperm taxonomic groups (families, orders and subclasses) were tested for over- and under-representation using resampling tests, and ecological characteristics of plant families were correlated with the prominence of each family in the data sets. As predicted by Baker\\'s previously proposed attributes of ‘ideal’ weeds, many over-represented families among agricultural weeds contained primarily herbaceous, rapidly reproducing, abiotically dispersed species. The natural area invaders, in contrast, were represented by a more ecologically diverse range of families and were over-represented by more largely woody families. Families with at least some abiotically pollinated species averaged significantly higher proportions of natural area invaders (p = 0·001) and agricultural weeds (p < 0·001) than biotically pollinated families. Families containing climbing species were more highly represented among natural area invaders than families without climbers (p < 0·009). While all non-native plants may carry some risk of becoming natural area invaders, this taxonomic analysis suggests that plants with amongst the highest risk of becoming natural area invaders worldwide include: species that are primarily aquatic or semi-aquatic, grasses, nitrogen-fixers, climbers, and clonal trees. Only 25% of natural area invaders were serious agricultural weeds, so quarantine legislation aimed at curbing the introduction of new agricultural weeds will be unlikely to prevent the introduction of most natural area invaders.Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) describes a growing family of approaches and methods to enable local people to share, enhance and analyze their knowledge of life and conditions, to plan and to act. PRA has sources in activist participatory research, agroecosystem analysis, applied anthropology, field research on farming systems, and rapid rural appraisal (RRA). In RRA information is more elicited and extracted by outsiders; in PRA it is more shared and owned by local people. Participatory methods include mapping and modeling, transect walks, matrix scoring, seasonal calendars, trend and change analysis, well-being and wealth ranking and grouping, and analytical diagramming. PRA applications include natural resources management, agriculture, poverty and social programs, and health and food security. Dominant behavior by outsiders may explain why it has taken until the 1990s for the analytical capabilities of local people to be better recognized and for PRA to emerge, grow and spread.ble development is an equitable, empowering, environmentally sound, economically viable process of growth. Energy is the key indicator of sustainable development. About 74% of the population of India live in rural areas. 80% of their energy needs are derived from biomass. About 92% of this energy is consumed in cooking activity. Women play a major role in biofuel management. Rural women\\'s perspective in sustainable development is therefore critical.Declining biofuel resources, poor quality of the available biofuels and inefficient devices have pushed women into greater hardships. This paper examines the role of rural women in biomass management. The energy resources that rural women use, the strategy that the government and other organisations have adopted to alleviate rural energy problems and how these strategies have benefited women and improved their quality of life, the importance of incorporating the concept of “gender and development” in alternative energy strategies to achieve the objectives of sustainable development are discussed in this paper.The phylogenetic relationships among 12 genera of treefrogs (Family, Rhacophoridae), were investigated based on a large sequence data set, including five nuclear (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, proopiomelanocortin, recombination activating gene 1, tyrosinase, rhodopsin) and three mitochondrial (partial 12S and 16S ribosomal RNA and the complete valine t-RNA) genes. Phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear gene sequences resolved three major clades. The first group included Philautus, Pseudophilautus, Kurixalus, Gracixalus, and Theloderma moloch; Pseudophilautus and Kurixalus were sister taxa. The second group consisted of Nyctixalus and Theloderma. The third group contained Feihyla, Polypedates, Rhacophorus, and Chiromantis vittatus; Polypedates and Feihyla were sister taxa. Analyses of the nuclear and mitochondrial genes supported the following results: (1) Genus Liuixalus formed the sister group of all other rhacophorines. (2) Philautus, Theloderma, and Chiromantis were not resolved as monophyletic genera. Four groups, including Philautus ocellatus and P. hainanus, P. longchuanensis and P. gryllus, P. banaensis, and P. quyeti nested well within the genera Liuixalus, Pseudophilautus, Kurixalus, and Gracixalus, respectively. (3) Theloderma moloch and Chiromantis vittatus did not cluster with other species of Theloderma and Chiromantis, respectively. Foam nesting evolved only once, as did laying eggs in a jelly-like matrix containing some bubbles. Terrestrial direct development evolved twice in the Rhacophoridae.r SummaryThis chapter discusses different aspects of the geographic distribution of muddy coasts. Muddy coasts have been defined as land-sea transitions that are entirely or in substantial part composed of muddy sediments. The major mudflat/salt-marsh/mangrove system is developed in the shelter of Cojimies Peninsula, reaching as far north as the town of Muisne. Shrimp ponds have been extensively excavated in the salt marshes. It is found that between Cojimies Peninsula and the Gulf of Guayaquil in the south, mangrove-fringed muddy shore deposits are once more restricted to the northern shores of some estuaries. The Patagonian coast of Argentina remains macrotidal almost up to the mouth of the Rio Negro in the north, being characterized by numerous small estuarine wetlands associated with river mouths and lagoons. Most of the smaller Caribbean islands and the Bahamas are characterized by microtidal conditions and steeply rising hinterlands that preclude the development of laterally extensive muddy shores.This study focussed on the comparative impact of young high density plantations of two Albizia species (Albizia lebbeck and Albizia procera) on the soil redevelopment process during early phase of mine spoil restoration in a dry tropical environment. Plant-hostile features such as high levels of pyrites, etc. were not present. We compared vegetational (biomass, net primary production (NPP), production efficiency, litter fall and its decomposition rate) and soil characters (soil nutrients, microbial biomass and N-mineralization rate) for these plantations. The A. lebbeck plantation accumulated greater biomass and exhibited higher net primary production than the A. procera plantation. The tree layer NPP of A. lebbeck plantation at 6 years age (25.4\\xa0t\\xa0ha−1 years−1) was even higher than that of native dry deciduous forest. The short-lived components (foliage, fine roots) accounted for a greater proportion of ecosystem function (productivity) than the long-lived component (stem). The efficiency of foliage for NPP was greater in A. lebbeck than in A. procera. Decomposition of leaf litter of A. lebbeck was faster than that of A. procera. Ninety five percent mass loss of leaf litter would require 922 days in A. lebbeck and 1328 days in A. procera. Amounts of N and P deposition through leaf fall and release of these nutrients increased with the age of plantation in both species but were higher for A. lebbeck plantation. There was a significant improvement in soil properties due to plantation of both species, but the organic C and kjeldahl N levels were higher in A. lebbeck plantation as were the N-mineralization rates and soil microbial biomass. The proportional increase in soil biomass was much higher than that in soil organic C. The study indicated that the restoration efficiency of A. lebbeck was greater than that of A. procera.ting covers the period September 1, 1997 through to October 31, 1997.

About 15–30% of the total amount of residue generated during coal combustion is fly ash (FA). FA is generally alkaline in nature and contains many toxic metals like Cr, Pb, Hg, As and Cd along with many essential elements like S, B, Ca, Na, Fe, Zn, Mn and P. Dumped FA contaminates the biosphere by mobilization of its fine particles and hazardous metals. Despite the negative environmental impact of FA, coal continues to be a major source of power production in India and therefore FA disposal is a major environmental issue. To overcome this problem, FA dumping sites have been started as a potential resource for biomass production of tree species. Phytoremediation is a strategy that uses plants to degrade, stabilize, and remove contaminants from soils, water and waste FA. Phytomanagement of FA is based on the plants\\' root systems, high biomass, woody nature, native nature, and resistance to pH, salinity, and toxic metals. Recently Indian researchers mostly from the National Botanical Research Institute have been working on phytoremediation and revegetation of FA dykes, inoculation of bacterial strains for reducing FA stress and biomass production from FA dykes. Many international researchers have worked on reclamation, revegetation and utilization of FA. FA utilization saves resources, mainly land (topsoil), water, coal, limestone and chemical fertilizer. Safe utilization of FA is a major concern around the world and regulatory bodies are enforcing stringent rules for the proper management of FA. This article summarizes various viable avenues in India for FA utilization and environmental management.I use three separate data bases to examine recipient community and site factors that might be influencing the establishment, persistence, and distribution of avian exotics. All in all, about half the variance between islands/regions in their numbers of successfully and unsuccessfully introduced species can be accounted for by recipient site-specific variables; the most important correlate of success is the number of native species extinctions over about the last 3000 years, which reflects the degree of human activity and habitat destruction and deterioration through intrusions of exotic predators, herbivores, and parasites. Consequently, the number of exotic species gained is close to the number of species lost through extinction. Even after controlling for avian extinctions, island area correlates positively with introduced species number. Invasion success does not decline significantly with the richness of the native avifauna (after controlling for the effects of extinctions and island area) nor the variety of potential mammalian predators. The relative proportion of extinct native species across islands/regions is negatively correlated with area and positively correlated with introduced species number and the number of endemic species. A strong correlation exists between the number of successes and the number of failures, attesting to the role of persistent acclimatization societies in increasing species numbers despite high failure rates. The relative success to failure rate increases with the number of extinct native species. The correlation between introductions and native extinctions seems to arise because native birds are usually more common, if not restricted, to native habitats while introduced birds are primary occupants of disturbed and open habitats. As more of an island\\'s area is converted to urban, agricultural and disturbed habitats or altered through the introduction of herbivores and exotic predators, most natives lose good living space while most introduced birds, that frequent open and disturbed areas and have evolved in predator-rich areas, gain habitat.I find little support for the notion that rich avifaunas in themselves repel the establishment of avian invaders at the level of whole islands or archipelagoes. However, interactions between established exotics and natives may be influencing habitat distributions of species in both sets within islands. In both man-made habitats and native forest habitats, exotic species number and the relative abundance of exotic birds is negatively related to the number of native species. After accounting for this local variation, exotic species number is positively related to exotic species number for the entire island/region. In local surveys the relative abundance of exotic birds compared to native birds is affected by habitat (non-native habitats have more exotics) and also by the numbers of species of exotics and natives on the island. The relative importance of biotic interactions like competition, apparent competition through differential disease transmission or susceptibility, and predation in shaping the abundance and habitat affinities of exotics and native species can be difficult to unravel when regional affects are so important.Persistent organochlorines in air, river water and sediment samples were analysed from eastern and southern Asia (India, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia) and Oceania (Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands) to elucidate their geographical distribution in tropical environment. The concentrations of organochlorines in these abiotic samples collected from Taiwan, Japan and Australia were also monitored for comparison. Atmospheric and hydrospheric concentrations of HCHs (hexachlorocyclohexanes) and DDTs (DDT and its metabolites) in the tropical developing countries were apparently higher than those observed in the developed nations, suggesting extensive usage of these chemicals in the lower latitudes. CHLs (chlordane compounds) and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) were also occasionally observed at higher levels in the tropics, implying that their usage area is also expanding southward. Distribution patterns of organochlorines in sediments showed smaller spatial variations on global terms, indicating that the chemicals released in the tropical environment are dispersed rapidly through air and water and retained less in sediments. The ratios of organochlorine concentrations in sediment and water phases were positively correlated with the latitude of sampling, suggesting that persistent and semivolatile compounds discharged in the tropics tend to be redistributed on a global scale.The Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) Lameta Formation exposed around Jabalpur in central India comprises a pedogenically modified fluvial succession. Accumulation of early diagenetic calcite cement during penecontemporaneous pedogenesis has transformed the fluvial sandstones into calcareous sandstones. The microscopic features of the palaeosol material include floating grain fabric, root traces, laminated micrite-microspar, micrite envelopes and corona structures, illuvial clay envelopes, poikilotopic spars and minor amounts of siliceous grain and void cutans.The palaeosol profiles of the Lameta Formation can be classified into eleven different types, nine of which are comparable to present-day mature aridisols and two to inceptisols. Nine to thirteen palaeosol profiles are present in the individual sections of the Lameta Formation within the study area. Each profile comprises two to four distinct pedohorizons arranged in vertical succession. There are six types of pedohorizons present in the area of study, namely, partly altered hosts, light-coloured and poorly cemented horizons, horizons with root traces and root-related alterations, horizons of subspherical glaebules, horizons of platy-fused glaebules and subhorizontal root traces and horizons with solution features. They show many characteristics similar to the present-day soil horizons, for example those termed C, Bk, K, A and E by pedologists.The palaeosol characteristics show correspondence to the nature of fluvial channel migration and the depth of the groundwater table (controlled by the geomorphic setting). A shallow groundwater table favoured the development of rootmat-bearing and gleyed horizons. Horizons with vertical root traces and glaebules occur where the groundwater table was low. Mature and thin palaeosols developed in those parts of the Lameta fluvial tract that were characterized by stable channels and wide floodplains. In contrast, thin and comparatively immature soils occurred in the parts where laterally migrating channels were operative.The characteristics of the Lameta palaeosols suggest that a hot and semiarid climate prevailed for most of the time represented by the Lameta Formation, but short-term wet spells occurred during the initial and the terminal phases of the Lameta accumulation. The low latitudinal palaeoposition of India and the absence of the palaeo-monsoon circulation might have produced the hot and semiarid climatic setting during this time.The popular view of primary and old secondary tropical rainforests is that they occur on infertile soils, have most of the nutrients in the above-ground living matter, and maintain a high production by rapid and efficient nutrient cycling. This paradigm pervades much land use planning rationale in forested areas in the tropics.In this paper, rainforest nutrient cycles are outlined and the methodological difficulties of work on them are emphasized. There is a shortage of information on nearly every aspect. It is concluded that the popular view is not fully justified even from the available data. Some rainforests occur on fertile soils with a high proportion of at least some nutrients below ground. In some cases there appears to be a substantial yearly loss of nutrients from the ecosystem and sometimes nutrient cycling is slow.Rainforest nutrition is immensely complex and shows many differences from one area to another. It is concluded that much more research is necessary before useful generalizations are possible.One of the three cardinal aspirations of Libya\\'s 1973–1975 Three-Year Development Plan was to build regime support by redistributing her oil wealth as extensively as possible among the various segments of her population. Housing was a key redistributive mechanism, with 18.4% (the highest) of the total budget for the Plan Period being allocated to it. Similarly, the Five-Year Transformation Plan of 1976–1980, which was designed as a rational supplement to the 1973–1975 Plan, used housing programmes to perform dual operations: a redistributive function by providing heavily subsidized mass housing and a productivity role by encouraging Libyans to acquire building construction skills. Housing investment by the Libyan State has thus intrinsically been a function of political and social, rather than economic, considerations.Benghazi City has been a major beneficiary of this subsidized mass housing policy. This is because Libya\\'s settlement pattern, which is marked by a high degree of primacy and intense spatial inequalities among regions, is fundamentally separated into two disjointed urban systems polarised on Tripoli and Benghazi.It is against this background that this paper explores the context in which housing activity has been undertaken in the city especially during the 1973–1975 and 1976–1980 Development Plan Periods. A proper understanding of the city\\'s settlement system in its social, spatial and hierarchical dimensions is essential for the definition of programmes for spatial expansion and in appraising the repercussions of alternative housing programmes.Darjeeling and Sikkim Himalayas, a part of Eastern Himalayan Hotspot, is characterized by its richness of plant diversity. Herbal medicine has been one of the most popular and reliable healing practices among the different ethnic groups of this region for ages. However, the lack of documentation practice by the traditional healers has led to obscurity regarding the efficacy of herbal medicine among the present generation, though they have to depend on the same quite often. Meanwhile, several reviews have attempted to document the plants used for the treatment of diabetes from this region, but interestingly, very few research works can be obtained regarding the characterization of antidiabetic properties of the plants of this region. Therefore, it demands a better understanding of the potentiality of these plants in the purview of scientific evidence. This review article reports 55 such plant species which have been reported to be frequently used in the treatment of hyperglycemia and our objective was to validate the potentiality of the plants in the light of recent phytochemical and pharmacological researches being carried out locally or elsewhere.Developing countries are under the clutch of malnutrition due to a lack of protein rich food. Protein supply can be broadened by exploration and exploitation of alternative legume sources. Even though many wild legume landraces have been identified, their utilization is limited due to insufficient attention. Canavalia gladiata, Canavalia ensiformis, Canavalia maritima and Canavalia cathartica are the common under-exploited legume species having the potential to be a rich protein source. This review envisages a comparative account of nutritional, antinutritional and functional properties and emphasizes the various methods employed in seed processing of Canavalia spp. The current study helps in understanding the nutritional and antinutritional versatility/potential of four Canavalia spp., thereby developing future strategies for optimum utilization.An integrated approach to energy planning, when applied to large hydroelectric projects, requires that the energy-opportunity cost of the land submerged under the reservoir be incorporated into the planning methodology. Biomass energy lost from the submerged land has to be compared to the electrical energy generated, for which we develop four alternative formulations of the net-energy function. The design problem is posed as an LP problem and is solved for two sites in India. Our results show that the proposed designs may not be viable in net-energy terms, whereas a marginal reduction in the generation capacity could lead to an optimal design that gives substantial savings in the submerged area. Allowing seasonal variations in the hydroelectric generation capacity also reduces the reservoir size. A mixed hydro-wood generation system is then examined and is found to be viable.Structuring soils on a landscape level of scale is a necessary prerequisite for an extrapolation of point results to greater areas (upscaling), not only in soil genetic research but also for ecological purposes. In this respect the catena concept provides a very useful paradigm to decipher soil pattern and related regular trends in soil chemical properties on the landscape scale. Using this approach we created types of matter distribution out of frequently recurring patterns. Three archetypes of catenas can be distinguished for soil components depending on the (im-)mobilization processes and hydrological regimes: (i) transformation catenas showing no gains or losses of the element/soil component under study (only transformation processes working), (ii) leaching catenas with losses in at least part of the catena and no accompanying elemental gains in other parts, and (iii) accumulation catenas showing gains in at least part of the catena but no losses elsewhere in the catena. From a spatial regular pattern of element losses combined with gains in one catena a translocation catena can be inferred. Such catenas can be regarded as a subgroup of the leaching- or accumulation-type, but exclude the transformation-type. Catenas which cover geomorphic units of distinctly different ages belong to the chrono catenas, a subgroup of either the transformation-, leaching-, or accumulation-type. The spatial arrangement and extension of depletion/accumulation areas and flow directions of translocated elements/soil components (down-/upslope) lead to a further subdivision of the catena types.The use of molecular techniques is rapidly growing as the tools have become more diverse and powerful, more widely available, and easier to implement. Molecular analyses are able to elucidate information about target weeds that is critical to improving control success, such as taxonomic clarification, evidence of hybridization and cryptic species, better development of test plant lists, population structure and origin of invasions. Similarly, molecular approaches can improve our knowledge of biological control agents, providing taxonomic clarity, identification of immature arthropods and fungal pathogens, and description of genetic variability in agents. Molecular tools also allow easier identification of host associations and provide a tool for post-release evaluation and tracking of agents. This review provides an overview of how to use molecular approaches in biological control of weeds, with the aim of assisting the adoption and facilitating fruitful collaboration between scientists studying the biology and ecology of agents and their targets and those with skills using molecular approaches. We describe the current molecular techniques relevant to classical biological control of weeds, instruct how to collect field materials for molecular analyses, and give recent examples of the use of molecular methods in biological control of weeds, with comments on the most appropriate methods for analysis of molecular data.An attempt is made in this paper to outline the general tectonic development of platforms. We hope that such a review will help to determine the directions which geological-geophysical research should take within the Upper Mantle Project.We apply the term platform, a synonym of craton, to any large portion of the continental crust bounded by folded belts or sometimes by oceans, and characterized by the following specific features: (a) tectonic stability over a very long period (several hundreds of million years or more); (b) general tectonic homogeneity (despite a complex inner structure and different times of formation of its separate parts); (c) an absence of high gradients of movement.Shields are elements of platforms which have been characterized by a tendency towards slow uplift over periods of hundreds of million years. They are not sharply delimited.We have accepted the following ages for the upper boundaries of Precambrian units: Archaean 2,600–2,800 m.y. (million years); Lower Proterozoic (Palaeoproterozoic, according to Salop) 2,100 m.y.; Middle Proterozoic (Mesoproterozoic) 1,850−1,650 m.y.; Upper Proterozoic (Neoproterozoic) 1,100 m.y.; Epi-Proterozoic (Epiproterozoic) 620 m.y.; Eocambrian 570 m.y.The authors believe, although the material here presented is based mainly on studies of Eurasian structures, that these results can be also applied to all other continents. Reference to data on other areas is always stipulated.r SummaryThis chapter discusses the different aspects of ocean currents over the continental slope. Continental slopes underlie some 12% of the world ocean\\'s surface area. Their importance to ocean circulation is out of proportion, since most of the major ocean currents flow over them and are in various ways affected by their topography. Superimposed on the typical upwelling regime are variations in the strength of the alongshore flow in response to changes of the wind stress. Coastal currents driven by density differences due to river runoff are common on continental shelves but reach to the upper slope only in a few places. Strong surface cooling, in the absence of significant salinity contrasts, produces cold and heavy coastal waters, the opposite of the coastal freshening case. Shallow water cools off rapidly, as its temperature also becomes uniform due to thermal convection, and tends to underflow less completely cooled deeper water. It is found that the fundamental slope effect examined above turns up in a different guise if the angular momentum balance of a fluid column fixed in space is considered instead of vorticity, allowing for external torques as well as the torque due to momentum advection.References to either indigenous uses or the results of controlled assays are numerous for species of Phyllanthus (Euphorbiaceae). These citations have been arranged by subgenus, section, subsection and species and will be published in four parts, including (Part IV) analysis, discussion and conclusions concerning apparent clustering of some uses or effects within taxa. This paper (Part II) covers the subgenus Phyllanthus.A range of perennial tropical crops represent the industrial crops of great economic value to the developing world. Among these, arecanut, cardamom, cashew, cinchona, cocoa, coconut, coffee, oil palm, palmyra, rubber, tea, and wattle are the most important ones with much commercial value to the economy of the third world. This chapter describes the agronomy and economy of the most important of these, arecanut, cashew nut, and coconut. All the three are grown to varying extent on the Asian, African, and the Latin American continents, and individually and collectively, contribute much to the economy of the nations in these three continents. And each of them has a checkered history of its own. For instance, cashew nut came from Brazil, the country of its origin, to the coast of Malabar, along the Arabian Sea, in Southern India to the State of Kerala with the Portuguese colonizers and spread from thereon, within the country and to its neighboring regions, after the British colonizers began patronizing it, as a delicious nut that goes very well with the pre-dinner evening Scotch, which is now a common feature in many social functions and is now contributing much to the Indian economy. While arecanut and coconut contribute much to the economy of Asian and Southeast Asian countries, cashew nut has come to occupy an important position in the Asian economy, in particular Indian, and to some extent African. Arecanut is primarily grown for its masticatory nuts, popularly known as betel nut or “supari,” as is popularly known in Northern India and Pakistan. No social or religious function in either of these two countries is complete without the supari being offered to the guest or participant in the festivities. India exports considerable quantity of arecanut to Pakistan. Each section of the chapter devoted to the individual crop deals with several aspects of production, the crop\\'s place in world economy vis-à-vis the countries where it is grown, and the ravages of pestilence, such as which is caused by the tea mosquito bug (TMB) in cashew nut, for which there still is no permanent cure which can be devastating to the cashew crop or the root wilt of coconut or the “koleroga” or “Mahali” (fruit rot) of arecanut. The review also includes the relevance of a refreshing new concept, developed by the author, which is now universally known as “The Nutrient Buffer Power Concept,” in the nutrition of these crops, which offers much scope for a breakthrough in productivity.r SummaryThis chapter examines the performance of a high-resolution mesoscale tropical prediction model. There are basically two types of mesoscale models, including quasistatic models and nonhydrostatic mesoscale models. The quasistatic models make use of horizontal resolutions of the order of 50 km or larger and can resolve mesoscale phenomena whose scale is of the order of a few hundred kilometers. The nonhydrostatic mesoscale models use a horizontal resolution of less than 5 km. The physical parametrizations of the model are largely based on the developments from global spectral model. These include shallow and deep moist convection, detailed calculation of radiative processes including cloud feedback processes, and a variable solar zenith angle. The surface fluxes are based on similarity theory and are coupled to the computation of surface hydrology and surface energy balance and they distinguish between the stable and unstable surface layers. The dynamical aspects of the regional model are also elaborated.References to either indigenous uses or the results of controlled assays are numerous for species of Pkyllanthus (Euphorbiaceae). These citations have been arranged by subgenus, section, subsection and species and will be published as three separate papers, followed by a paper discussing the apparent clustering of some uses or effects within taxa. This paper, the first of the series, covers the subgenera Isocladus, Kirganelia, Cicca and Emblica.SHRIMP dating of magmatic zircons from granitoid gneisses and charnockites of the Trivandrum and Nagercoil Blocks in the granulite terrane of southernmost India yielded well-defined protolith emplacement ages between 1765 and ca. 2100\\xa0Ma and also document variable recrystallization and/or lead-loss during the late Neoproterozoic Pan-African event at around 540\\xa0Ma. Hf-in-zircon and whole rock Nd isotopic data suggest that the granitoid host rocks were derived from mixed crustal sources, and Hf–Nd model ages vary between 2.2 and 2.8\\xa0Ga. A gabbroic dyke, emplaced into a charnockite protolith and deformed together with it, only contained metamorphic zircon whose mean age of 542.3\\xa0±\\xa04.0\\xa0Ma reflects the peak of granulite–facies metamorphism during the Pan-African high-grade event. The Sm–Nd whole-rock isotopic system of several granitoid samples dated in this study was significantly disturbed during granulite–facies metamorphism, most likely due to a CO2-rich fluid phase. Whole-rock Nd model ages are consistently older than zircon-derived Hf model ages.The Trivandrum and Nagercoil Blocks are reinterpreted as a single tectono-metamorphic terrane predominantly consisting of Palaeoproterozoic granitoids interlayered with supracrustal rocks that must be older than ca. 2100\\xa0Ma. Ductile deformation, migmatization and anatexis have obliterated the original rock relationships. These blocks probably have their counterpart in the Highland Complex of neighbouring Sri Lanka and in the high-grade Palaeoproterozoic terrane of southern Madagascar. We speculate that the southern Indian khondalites may have their counterparts in the khondalite belt of the North China Craton.Energy planning of any region should be based on existing levels of energy consumption. Sectorwise disaggregated information of energy usage is developed for the Uttara Kannada District to assist in the regional energy planning exercise. This paper provides comparative analyses of village level domestic energy consumption patterns across coastal, interior, hilly and plain zones considering regional and seasonal variations. Cooking, water heating and space heating are the major end use activities. The results, based on eighteen months of field research in five taluks of Uttara Kannada, reveal that the average energy consumption norm does vary significantly for cooking and water heating in various seasons across the zones. Among the five taluks, 90 villages (out of 119) and all divisions of Kumta town in the Kumta taluk and 190–220 randomly selected households in selected villages of Sirsi, Mundgod, Siddapur and Ankola were studied. A survey of 1304 households from 90 villages in the Kumta taluk shows that most of them still use traditional stoves for cooking (97.92%) and water heating (98.3%). Average consumption (kg/person/day) for cooking ranges from 2.01±1.49 (coastal) to 2.32±2.09 (hilly). Seasonwise cooking fuel wood requirement for coast and hilly zones, ranges from 1.98 and 2.22 (summer) to 2.11 and 2.51 (monsoon), respectively, while for water heating (for bath and washing), it ranges from 1.17±0.02 (coast) to 1.63±0.05 (hilly). Seasonal variation is evident from the range 1.12 and 1.53 (summer) to 1.22 and 1.73 (monsoon) for coastal and hilly zones, respectively. Analysis of other sources of energy for domestic purposes shows that kerosene is used for cooking and lighting in the coast. Kerosene consumption (l/person/month) for cooking ranges from 0.05 (hilly) to 0.34 (coast) and for lighting ranges from 0.75 (coast) to 0.99 (hilly). Availability of bioresources in hilly zone is the main reason for less consumption of kerosene for cooking. In the hilly zone, electrification of all households has not been possible, as they are scattered. Because of the erratic supply during all seasons (especially monsoon), electrified households also depend on kerosene for lighting. Based on fuel consumption norms (regionwise, seasonwise and end usewise), (a) the total fuel wood required (cooking, water heating, space heating, jaggery making and parboiling) works out to 1.668,698.23 tonnes/year, (b) the electricity demand, excluding irrigation, is about 32.65 million kWh/year and (c) the kerosene demand for cooking and water heating is about 15.86 million litres per year.r SummaryThis chapter discusses the ecophysiology of trees of seasonally dry tropics. This chapter focuses on the seasonally dry tropical and subtropical woodlands and forests of the world, and differentiates woodland from forest on the basis of percentage canopy cover. It presents the physiological and structural properties that determine water and gas exchange relationships of trees in seasonally dry tropical habitats. These properties must eventually be linked to the larger-scale processes to explain patterns of productivity and ecosystem function. Seasonally dry forests represent an important class of vegetation, globally. Temperature and light availability are infrequently limiting for productivity. However, water can be very limiting for a significant part of the year in the majority, but not for all seasonally dry woodlands and forests. Deciduous and evergreen species represent two ends of a continuum of leaf lifespan. The chapter discusses the cost-benefit analyses for leaves of savanna trees, and mentions that construction costs of leaves can be calculated from detailed investigations of biochemical pathways utilized during construction of the principal components of leaves.r SummaryThe chapter reviews the meteorological phenomena that are associated with topography. The study of airflow past mountains is complicated by the wide range of scales that must be considered. The ratios of the mountain width to each of the natural length scales are important in determining the physical regime of the flow. This idea is emphasized in the chapter by treating the effects of boundary layers and buoyancy. The theory of two-dimensional mountain waves with the help of its governing equations is presented and the observations of mountain waves are presented. The chapter also examines the influence of the boundary layer on mountain flows and slope winds and mountain and valley winds. It considers the perturbation to the wind flow caused by a mountain of intermediate scale where the rotation of the Earth cannot be neglected. For this the flow near mesoscale and synoptic-scale mountains, quasi-geostrophic flow over a mountain, the effect of inertia on the flow over mesoscale mountains, and theories of lee cyclogenesis are discussed. Finally the chapter describes planetary-scale mountain waves; a vertically integrated model of topographically forced planetary waves; the vertical structure of planetary waves; models of stationary planetary waves allowing meridional propagation and lateral; and variation in the background wind.r SummaryThe purpose of this chapter is to discuss the origin and cytogenetics rice. Rice and wheat are the most important food plants of man. The chapter reviews that the importance of rice is much more than the production figures would indicate. About 90% of the rice is produced and consumed in South and Southeast Asia. It forms the staple food of 54% of all humans, against 34% of wheat and only 4% of maize. Compared to its importance, much less is known about the genetics of rice than of other crop plants. The chapter also discusses that the cultivated rice\\'s of the world belong to two species, sativa, and glaberrima. Commonly known as Asiatic rices, sativa is the species cultivated throughout the rice-growing areas of the world. However, it is in South and Southeast Asia, where most of the rice is grown, that both sativa and wild rice\\'s occur in great profusion and variability.']]\n",
