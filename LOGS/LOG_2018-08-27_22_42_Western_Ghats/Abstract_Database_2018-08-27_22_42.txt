Abstract: 'AbstractThe present study was aimed to explore the traditional knowledge of Irula tribal people who are practicing herbal medicine in Walayar valley, the Southern Western Ghats, India. A total number of 146 species of plants distributed in 122 genera belonging to 58 families were identified as commonly used ethnomedicinal plants by them. Interestingly, 26 new claims were also made in the present study. Through the data obtained from Irula tribal healers, the herbs were mostly used for medicine (40.4%) followed by trees (26.7%) and climbers (18.5%). In addition leaves were highly used for medicinal purposes, collected from 55 species (38%) followed by multiple parts from 18 species (12%). Acorus calamus is the species of higher use value (1.80) assessed to be prescribed most commonly for the treatment of cough. High informant consensus factor (1.0) obtained for insecticidal uses and cooling agent indicates that the usage of Canarium strictum and Melia dubia, and Mimosa pudica and Sesamum indicum respectively for that purposes had obtained high degree of agreement among the healers in using these species for the respective purposes. The most commonly used method of preparation was decoction (63%) followed by raw form (23%), paste (12%) and powder (2%). Therefore, it is suggested to take-up pharmacological and phytochemical studies to evaluate the species to confirm the traditional knowledge of Irulas on medicinal plants.'

Mean gross soil erosion in MRB is 14.36\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0yr\xe2\x88\x921, whereas mean net soil erosion (i.e., gross erosion\xe2\x80\x93deposition) is only 3.60\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0yr\xe2\x88\x921 (i.e., roughly 25% of the gross erosion).

Although mean gross soil erosion rates in the natural vegetation belts are relatively higher, compared to agriculture, settlement/built-up areas and tea plantation, the sediment transport efficiency in agricultural areas and tea plantation is significantly high, reflecting the role of human activities on accelerated soil erosion. In MRB, on a mean basis, 0.42\xc2\xa0t of soil organic carbon (SOC) content is being eroded per hectare annually, and SOC loss from the 4th order sub-basins shows considerable differences, mainly due to the spatial variability in the gross soil erosion rates among the sub-basins. The quantitative results, on soil erosion and deposition, modelled using RUSLE and TLSD, are expected to be beneficial while formulating comprehensive land management strategies for reducing the extent of soil degradation in tropical mountain river basins.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (304KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Evaluation of radionuclides in the terrestrial environment of Western Ghats'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe activity concentration of naturally occurring radionuclides in soil samples of an elevated radiation background area of Western Ghats were determined using gamma-ray spectrometry with the aim of evaluating the environmental radioactivity. The annual effective dose equivalent and the radiation hazard indices from the soil activity were estimated to reduce the harmful effects of gamma radiation to the population dwelling in the area. The activity concentrations of 232Th and average outdoor terrestrial gamma dose rate were found to be higher than the world average, this may affect Western Ghats environment in general. Therefore, the radiological risks to the general population from ionizing radiation from the naturally occurring radionuclides in the soil are considered to be significant. However, other radiological hazard indices were found to be within permissible limits.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Predictors were assessed using presence-only and bootstrap.\xe2\x80\xa2Climate change significantly decline species suitable distribution.\xe2\x80\xa2Results indicated an excellent accuracy in Maxent outputs.\xe2\x80\xa2Temperature seasonality and isothermality contribute the maximum to the distribution Garcinia indica.\xe2\x80\xa2Predicted suitability and predictors contribution could help conservation planning and management.AbstractIn recent years, climate change has become a major threat and has been widely documented in the geographic distribution of many plant species. However, the impacts of climate change on the distribution of ecologically vulnerable medicinal species remain largely unknown. The identification of a suitable habitat for a species under climate change scenario is a significant step towards the mitigation of biodiversity decline. The study, therefore, aims to predict the impact of current, and future climatic scenarios on the distribution of the threatened Garcinia indica across the northern Western Ghats using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modelling. The future projections were made for the year 2050 and 2070 with all Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenario (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) using 56 species occurrence data, and 19 bioclimatic predictors from the BCC-CSM1.1 model of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change\xe2\x80\x99s (IPCC) 5th assessment. The bioclimatic variables were minimised to a smaller number of variables after a multicollinearity test, and their contributions were assessed using jackknife test. The AUC value of 0.956\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.023 indicates that the model performs with excellent accuracy. The study identified that temperature seasonality (39.5\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf3.1%), isothermality (19.2\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf1.6%), and annual precipitation (12.7\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf1.7%) would be the major influencing variables in the current and future distribution. The model predicted 10.50% (19318.7\xe2\x80\xafsq.\xe2\x80\xafkm) of the study area as moderately to very highly suitable, while 82.60% (151904\xe2\x80\xafsq.\xe2\x80\xafkm) of the study area was identified as \xe2\x80\x98unsuitable\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98very low suitable\xe2\x80\x99. Our predictions of Climate change impact on habitat suitability suggest that there will be a drastic reduction in the suitability by 5.29% and 5.69% under RCP 8.5 for 2050 and 2070, respectively.Objective and SignificancePrimary objective of this study is to identify the potential distribution of medicinally and ecologically important but threatened Garcinia indica species in the northern Western Ghats on the basis of species occurrence data and nineteen bioclimatic predictors. Using MaxEnt modelling, current and future species distribution and suitability has been predicted using the BCC-CSM1.1 and four RCP scenarios of 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5. The results also signify the bioclimatic variables contribution to the species distribution in northern Western Ghats.Finally, the results signify that the model might be an efficient tool for biodiversity protection, ecosystem management, and species re-habitation planning under future climate change scenarios.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (208KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Assigning conservation value and identifying hotspots of endemic rattan diversity in the Western Ghats, India'
Author: 'Mukta'

Abstract: 'AbstractRattans, or canes, are one of the most important non-timber forest products supporting the livelihood of many forest-dwelling communities in South and North-eastern India. Due to increased demand for rattan products, rattans have been extracted indiscriminately from the Western Ghats, a 1600-km mountain chain running parallel to the west coast of India. Extensive harvesting, loss of habitat and poor regeneration has resulted in dwindling rattan populations, necessitating an urgent attempt to conserve existing rattan resources. In this study, using niche-modelling tools, an attempt has been made to identify areas of high species richness of rattans in the Western Ghats, one of the mega-diversity regions of the world. We have also developed conservation values for 21 economically important and endemic rattans of the Western Ghats. We identified at least two to three sites of extremely high species richness outside the existing protected area network that should be prioritized for in situ conservation. This study emphasizes the need to develop strategies for the long-term conservation of rattans in the Western Ghats, India.'

Abstract: 'AbstractWildlife utilization in the tropics is massive, with nearly 5 million tons of bushmeat consumed by local communities. In India, a megadiversity nation, hunting\xe2\x80\x94although illegal\xe2\x80\x94is widespread among indigenous communities. However, the extent, frequency, and rationale for hunting, and factors influencing wildlife utilization are poorly known. Our study, based on 19 different indigenous communities in the Western Ghats region, revealed the utilization of 54 wild species/taxa. Although freshwater fish, herpetofauna, and small mammals were most frequently utilized, enforcement by the Forest Department was largely focused on large mammals. Gender, land ownership, number of domestic meats consumed, distance to markets, time spent hunting, and distance to hunting areas were major factors that affected wild meat utilization in the region. Although conservation needs to be focused on the most utilized groups, increasing access to domestic meats at remote settlements and integrating utilization of common, culturally prominent species can improve conservation of threatened fauna.'

Abstract: 'AbstractSoil erosion and deposition in a tropical mountainous river basin, viz., Pambar River Basin (PRB), in a rain shadow region of the southern Western Ghats (India) were modelled using Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and transport limited sediment delivery (TLSD) function in GIS. Mean gross soil erosion in the basin is 11.70\xe2\x80\xaft\xe2\x80\xafha\xe2\x88\x921 yr\xe2\x88\x921, and is comparable with the results of previous soil erosion studies from the region. However, mean net soil erosion from the basin is 2.92\xe2\x80\xaft\xe2\x80\xafha\xe2\x88\x921 yr\xe2\x88\x921 only, which is roughly 25% of the gross soil erosion. Although natural vegetation belts show relatively higher gross- and net-soil erosion rates (mainly due to high LS and C factors), their sediment transport efficiency is remarkably less, compared to the land use/ land cover types with anthropogenic signatures (i.e., plantations and croplands). Despite the lesser amount of annual rainfall, the high rates of soil loss from the semi-arid areas of the basin might be the result of the poor protective vegetation cover as well as isolated high intensity rainfall events. The study highlights the significance of climate-specific plans for soil erosion management and conservation of the soil resources of the basins developed in rain shadow regions.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe edible wild mushrooms are most important in food security of ethnic groups and tribals throughout the world. Various indigenous strategies are followed to trace wild mushrooms suitable for human consumption. Data presented in this article projects ethnic knowledge on 51 edible wild mushrooms (in 23 genera) in the Western Ghats region of India. Information collected with support of ethnic groups/tribals pertains to habitats, substrates, mutualistic association, extent of availability, extent of edibility and method of processing of wild mushrooms. Extensive field visits and interactions with ethnic groups were performed to collect the data on each mushroom. Initially, most of these mushrooms were identified based on the indigenous methods and designated with vernacular names (Are-Gowda, Kodava and Tulu). Based on macromorphology (in field) and micromorphology (in laboratory), each mushroom was identified with its systematic name. Among the 51 wild mushrooms irrespective of extent of availability, the most preferred include Astraeus hygrometricus, Clitocybe infundibuliformis, Fistulina hepatica, Lentinus sajor-caju, Pleurotus (5 spp.) and Scleroderma citrinum and Termitomyces (18 spp.). This data forecasts the importance of documentation of traditional knowledge, protection of habitats, management of resources (tree species and substrates) and sustainable exploitation of wild mushrooms.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Two generations of geophysical lineaments are identified in Central Kerala.\xe2\x80\xa2First generation nucleated around distensional dyke lineaments of 90\xc2\xa0Ma and 65\xc2\xa0Ma during the episodic breakup of Gondwanaland over a hot mantle.\xe2\x80\xa2Second generation of strike slip faults evolved in the Neogene on a cold continent.\xe2\x80\xa2All the lineaments were reactivated during the late Cenozoic.\xe2\x80\xa2These lineaments have possible connections with the uplift of the Western Ghats, an active geomorphic feature.AbstractA family of geophysical lineaments have been identified in \xe2\x88\xbc15,000\xc2\xa0km2 in central Kerala between 9\xc2\xb030\xe2\x80\xb2N to 10\xc2\xb045\xe2\x80\xb2N and 76\xc2\xb000\xe2\x80\xb2E to 77\xc2\xb030\xe2\x80\xb2E, integrating geophysical data with geological and geomorphological features. The characteristics of these lineaments in the magnetic and gravity fields and their derivatives have been analysed. The evolution of the lineaments has been traced to the temporal phases of global evolution of the region. A group of these faults have formed by reactivation of the deep-seated distensional fractures associated with and accompanying dyke emplacements during the episodic breakup of Gondwana at \xe2\x88\xbc90 and 65\xc2\xa0Ma under distinctive mantle thermal regimes. It is possible that reactivation of these distensional faults may have started during the cooling interval of time between the two distensions in the 90 and 65\xc2\xa0Ma and post 65\xc2\xa0Ma periods and later in the Cenozoic, when the lineaments were enlarged to their present dimension, possibly under the influence of forces that led to the uplift of the western Ghats. These may extend down to the crust-mantle interface. A cluster of younger geophysical lineaments has been generated by reactivation along the weak planes of transformation of the charnockitic rocks of the Precambrian. They seem to have a strike-slip character. They are devoid of any dyke association and were formed on a cold crust. They may be confined to the upper-middle crust. They were generated in the high intensity intra-plate palaeo-stress fields of the triple forces arising from (1) the back-thrust from the Himalayan Collision; (2) the impact of epeirogenic forces and related isostatic uplift of the Western Ghats and (3) the flexural isostatic uplifts due to surface loads of late Mesozoic basaltic lavas and Cenozoic sedimentation in the coastal rifted basins in late Cenozoic, probably in the time span of 20\xc2\xa0Ma to the present, when the palaeostress fields were most intense.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (1006KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractCeropegia thwaitesii Hook (Asclepiadaceae), an endemic plant species, due to habitat destruction and over exploitation has a very restricted distribution in the Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India. The present wrok aimed to determine the chemical composition, the total phenolic (TPC), flavonoid (TFC) and tannin content (TEC), and to assess the antioxidant properties of various extracts of in vivo plants (IVP) and in vitro regenerated plants (IRP) of C. thwaitesii. Some phenolic compounds like gallic acid, cathechol, vanillin and salicylic acid were identified and quantified by HPLC. All the extracts possessed relevant radical scavenging activity on DPPH, Superoxide radical scavenging activity, and Nitric oxide radicals as well as total antioxidant ability. DPPH assay of in vitro methanol stems extracts and ethanol leaves extracts revealed the best antioxidant properties with important IC50 values of 0.248\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.45\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb5g/mL and 0.397\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.67\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb5g/mL, respectively, whereas in vivo chloroform stems extracts showed a lower antioxidant activity (IC50 of 10.99\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.24\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb5g/mL). The IRP methanol extracts of stem and leaves had good inhibitory activity against all tested microorganisms in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggested that in vitro raised plants of C. thwaitesii are an excellent source of antioxidant compounds to be exploited on an industrial level as food additive.'

Abstract: 'AbstractOne of the reasons for the highly subdued response of the catchments, even to rainfalls of very high daily intensity, in the wet tropical areas of the Western Ghats in Karnataka is their soil mantle, which is very thick, well drained and very stable. An attempt is made in this work to understand the factors leading to such features, through a field study of the hydrological properties of the soils in the region. Cores extracted at road cuttings, from three different depths, at ten sampling sites scattered over the upland areas of the Kumaradhara basin, selected with due regard for the type of land covers commonly associated with hydrology, have been subjected to laboratory experiments to determine the soil texture, the porosity and the hydraulic conductivities. Ring infiltration tests have also been conducted on the field to cross verify the laboratory results. Storage capacity of the soils is estimated and compared with the rainfall magnitude in two small catchments in the area. The results indicate that the surface soils are sandy, while even at great depths, soils are Silty sands or Sandy silts, with high porosities and low drainage rates. The results are interpreted to mean that preferential pathways of macro-pores and soil piping would be an important feature in these areas. It is emphasised that more elaborate studies need to be taken up in order to understand the subsurface runoff processes in this hydrologically unique tropical region.'

The present study is an expansion of the database by adding mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (mtCOI) sequences from forty three species of indigenous true bugs of India. mtCOI gene analysis of infraorder Pentatomomorpha covering a total of seventy three species that belong to five superfamilies; Pentatomoidea, Coreoidea, Pyrrhocoroidea, Lygaeoidea and Aradoidea revealed more than 3% interspecific distances in all the taxa studied except for two cases which showed barcode sharing. Less than 2% intra-specific divergence was observed in 97% of the taxa analysed and the average interspecies genetic distance was about 29 times higher than the average intraspecies genetic divergence. Distinct sequence divergence pattern at generic level and NJ clustering analysis suggests that COI barcode is an excellent molecular marker for species level identification of unknown taxa; however it may not be useful for resolving deep levels of divergence. Species identification even at nymphal stage could be achieved confirming the efficacy of this technique.Graphical abstractFig.\xc2\xa01.

Abstract: 'AbstractIntroductionMicrobial diseases are increasing year by year and they are becoming a big threat to public health. There are more than 200 known diseases transmitted by bacteria, fungi, viruses, prions, rickettsia and other microbes to humans. The emergence of drug resistance to chemical drugs is the biggest threat in controlling human pathogens. Hence novel antimicrobial agents from actinomycetes are timely needed for the control of several human pathogens.AimThe aim was to find some actinomycetes with antimicrobial metabolites.MethodsSoil samples were collected from Nilgiris district in Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India. Actinomycetes were isolated using serial dilution and plating techniques on actinomycetes isolation agar. Streptomycin and ketoconazole (25\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/disc) were used as reference controls. The active strains were identified by 16S rRNA and phylogenetic tree was constructed; the sequences were submitted in the GenBank.ResultsTotally 106 actinomycete strains were isolated and cross streaked against various human microbial pathogens. Only 44 (41.50%) exhibited good antimicrobial activity against different pathogenic microbes. Five isolates (FMS-20, TGH-30, TGH-31, TGH-31-1 and IS-4) were chosen for secondary screening using filtrate. Among them FMS-20 filtrate showed good inhibition on the 16th day against all tested microbial pathogens. Further the intracellular methanol extract of FMS-20 showed maximum zone of inhibition against A. brasiliensis (22\xc2\xa0mm) at 5\xc2\xa0mg/disc. Similarly the extracellular ethyl acetate extract of FMS-20 showed maximum zone of inhibition against B. subtilis (25\xc2\xa0mm).ConclusionsThe present work revealed that, among 106 actinomycetes screened, Streptomyces rimosus (FMS-20) (Accession No-KT827106) showed promising antimicrobial activity against all the tested human microbial pathogens.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe recognition of temporally stable location with respect to soil moisture content is of importance for soil water management decisions, especially at watershed scale. And most importantly, the profile soil moisture which play a vital role in generation of runoff in a watershed. In this regard, it is very essential to understand the behavior of soil moisture for their vertical and horizontal stability. To this end, a watershed located in the Western Ghats close to Kodigibail Village, Siddapur Taluk, Uttara Kannada District of Karnataka State, India, was selected for monitoring of soil moisture. The soil moisture was measured at weekly time step for a period of Jan 206 to Dec 2009. The measured soil moisture values were used for evaluation following issues (a) temporal and spatial variation of the observed soil moisture and (b) stability of soil moisture for both vertical and horizontal scale. The results obtained through the analysis of the observed soil moisture revealed that, the soil moisture content in the watershed exhibit both vertical and horizontal stability and can be considered as representative of the watershed.'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2First study of bats in tea plantations, first fine scale tropical bat HSM.\xe2\x80\xa2Many bats live in tea dominated landscapes if there is adequate native tree cover.\xe2\x80\xa2Shade coffee with native trees can be suitable even for some forest specialist bats.\xe2\x80\xa2Replanting even small forest patches will help bats, including forest specialists.\xe2\x80\xa2Riparian areas are important for all species not just riparian specialists.AbstractTo conserve biodiversity it is imperative that we understand how different species respond to land use change, and determine the scales at which habitat changes affect species' persistence. We used habitat suitability models (HSMs) at spatial scales from 100\xe2\x80\x934000\xc2\xa0m to address these concerns for bats in the Western Ghats of India, a biodiversity hotspot of global importance where the habitat requirements of bats are poorly understood. We used acoustic and capture data to build fine scale HSMs for ten species (Hesperoptenus tickelli, Miniopterus fuliginosus, Miniopterus pusillus, Myotis horsfieldii, Pipistrellus ceylonicus, Megaderma spasma, Hipposideros pomona, Rhinolophus beddomei, Rhinolophus indorouxii and Rhinolophus lepidus) in a tea-dominated landscape. Small (100\xe2\x80\x93500\xc2\xa0m) scale habitat variables (e.g. percentage tea plantation cover) and distances to habitat features (e.g. distance to water) were the strongest predictors of bat occurrence, likely due to their high mobility, which enables them to exploit even small or isolated foraging areas. Most species showed a positive response to coffee plantations grown under native shade and to forest fragments, but a negative response to more heavily modified tea plantations. Two species were never recorded in tea plantations. This is the first study of bats in tea plantations globally, and the first ecological Old World bat study to combine acoustic and capture data. Our results suggest that although bats respond negatively to tea plantations, tea-dominated landscapes that also contain forest fragments and shade coffee can nevertheless support many bat species."

This underexplored species is considered to be a valuable source of both biotic and abiotic stress resistance. However habitat destruction has resulted in the decline of this genetic resource. The present work deals with the seed germination studies and zygotic embryo cryopreservation of M. acuminata subsp. burmannica collected from southern Western Ghats of Kerala. Current study was conducted to access the viability of Musa seeds both in vivo and in vitro under various conditions. The experiments were carried out on seeds at different moisture conditions. Seeds were subjected to physical treatment (removal of operculum) before sawing. Different natural (soil (100%), sand (100%) and soil: sand (50:50%) mixtures) and synthetic media (Murashige and Skoog) fortified with plant growth regulators (indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (0.2, 0.5, 1.0\xc2\xa0mg/l) and 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0\xc2\xa0mg/l)) were tried to achieve optimum growth. Sucrose preculture (6%) for 4\xc2\xa0h, 8\xc2\xa0h & 12\xc2\xa0h and air dehydration (for 1, 2, 3 & 4\xc2\xa0h) technique was carried out for developing cryopreservation protocol for long term conservation. Under in vitro conditions, 88.5% germination was observed compared to uneven germination under in vivo conditions. Best growth was achieved in MS medium supplemented with 0.8\xc2\xa0mg/l BAP. Seeds desiccated to moisture content 13% exhibited higher germination percentage than fresh seeds in both in vivo and in vitro conditions. Zygotic embryos with moisture content 13% could be successfully recovered after cryostorage. Better regeneration was observed among embryos precultured in 6% sucrose for 8\xc2\xa0h.'

Title: 'Flow Regionalization Under Limited Data Availability \xe2\x80\x93 Application of IHACRES in the Western Ghats\xe2\x98\x86'

Abstract: 'AbstractLong-term measurements of river stream flow are essential for numerous applications in water resources. In many parts of the world, rivers remain ungauged; stream flow prediction for such ungauged catchment requires information transfer from gauged catchments that are perceived to be hydrologically similar to them. Prediction of stream flows at ungauged catchments is typically performed through the transfer of hydrologic information (e.g., model parameters, hydrologic indices, stream flow values) from gauged to ungauged catchments. This procedure is commonly referred to as regionalization. Hydrologic models have been used extensively for the purpose of transfer of hydrologic model parameters from gauged to ungauged catchments and these models include HBV, IHACRES and PDM.In the present study, for the purpose of regionalisation, a lumped conceptual model namely, IHACRES has been used. IHACRES is a parsimonious model having six numbers of parameters and requires small data input. The model parameters are used to characterise the daily stream flow of the catchment and are related to the landscape attributes of the catchments. Further, as an offshoot, IHACRES provides for base-flow separation and development of unit hydrograph, which becomes an input in other hydrological works.In the current paper, the model IHACRES is applied at daily time step to six catchments (Malathi, Hemavathi, Lakshmanthirtha, Yetthinahole, Kadumanehalla and Kumaradhara) in the region of Western Ghats, Karnataka. IHACRES, being parsimonious, requires precipitation and temperature as the only data-input. Information is compiled for physical catchment descriptors using the elevation map of the area (DEM) and relationships are developed between the parameters and the descriptors. These relationships are validated by modelling daily stream flow of a gauged catchment (Nethravathi). This work proves that as an alternative model, IHACRES does well in the domain of flow regionalization with least data inputs.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIndia is bestowed with rich diversity inter alia in natural resources, forests, water bodies, climate, people, language and crops grown. In order to sustainably manage, conserve and judicioususenatural resources, collective action bycommunity initiativeis desirable since private property rights lead to inequitable and unsustainable use. In this paper,efforts towardsconservation of natural forests through the collective action of providing social fencing reflected in the institution of sacred groves are discussed. This pertains to the village community in the Western Ghats region of Karnataka, India, committed towards stringent conservation efforts. The rituals of annual festivity called Devatehabba, (The worshiping festival of Goddess Mother Nature) as they trust are a part of the conservation efforts binding the members of the village community together for the cause of nature conservation. On the day of festivity, the village community invites relatives, friends and admirers to Devarabana (irgin forest grove maintained in the name of Mother Nature for centuries without any disturbance)for participation inworship of the Mother Nature which is called as Sacred Grove. In some villages, an icon, Idol or earthen pot structure is worshipped in the sanctum of Devarabana. The entry to the sanctum is restricted to the day of annual worship in the year. Thus, after the festival, if any person forgets hi+91-9449801215s/her belongings, the same can be found on the very festival day, next year only in the sacred grove. Members of the village community are not supposed to graze their livestock in the sacred grove.'

Title: 'Research PaperStimulus of developmental projects to landscape dynamics in Uttara Kannada, Central Western Ghats'

Abstract: 'AbstractUnplanned large scale developmental projects in recent times have been causing alterations in land use land cover [LULC] at spatial and temporal scales with the substantial changes in the landscape. Uttara Kannada district has the distinction of having highest forest cover in India. Forest ecosystems in the district have witnessed major transformations due to industrialization during the post-independence. Impact of developmental activities during the post-independence era, is evident from barren hill tops due to deforestation. The analysis of temporal spatial data acquired through space borne sensors highlights the decline of evergreen-semi evergreen forest cover from 67.73% (1973) to 32.08% (2013). The ad-hoc approaches adopted in the implementation of developmental projects in the ecologically sensitive regions has impaired the ecosystem services affecting the people\xe2\x80\x99s livelihood. The changes in the landscape structure with LULC changes have altered the functional abilities of an ecosystem evident from lowered hydrological yield, disappearing perennial streams, higher instances of human\xe2\x80\x93animal conflicts, declined ecosystem goods, etc. About 64355\xc2\xa0Ha of forest land is diverted for various non-forestry activities during the last four decades by the government apart from encroachment of 7072\xc2\xa0Ha of forest area for agriculture, horticulture activities, etc. Encroachment of forest land has resulted in the land degradation leading to reduced productivity. Alterations in bio-geo chemical and hydrological cycles have necessitated the restoration of native forests in the region to ensure water and food security, and livelihood of the local people. Monitoring and visualization of landscape dynamics helps in evolving appropriate management strategies. LULC dynamics analyses considering agents (developmental projects) through fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) integrated with Markov cellular automata (CA) indicate the developmental projects such as West Coast Paper Mill (WCPM) and Kaiga Nuclear Power House (KNPH) will lead to further fragmentation of forests with spurt in urbanization by 2022. This necessitates framing appropriate policy measures to sustain natural resources focusing on the landscape\xe2\x80\x99s ecological, hydrological, economic and social factors.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Assessment of spaceborne DEM accuracy in tropical mountainous terrain.\xe2\x80\xa2Despite coarser resolution, SRTM has relatively higher vertical accuracy compared to ASTER.\xe2\x80\xa2Topographic complexity and vegetation influence DEM accuracy.\xe2\x80\xa2GMTED unsuitable for elevation analysis of tropical mountain landscapes.AbstractThe paper evaluates sensitivity of various spaceborne digital elevation models (DEMs), viz., Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Shuttle Radar Topography Mapping Mission (SRTM) and Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED), in comparison with the DEM (TOPO) derived from contour data of 20\xc2\xa0m interval of Survey of India topographic sheets of 1: 50,000 scale. Several topographic attributes, such as elevation (above mean sea level), relative relief, slope, aspect, curvature, slope-length and -steepness (LS) factor, terrain ruggedness index (TRI), topographic wetness index (TWI), hypsometric integral (Ihyp) and drainage network attributes (stream number and stream length) of two tropical mountain river basins, viz., Muthirapuzha River Basin and Pambar River Basin are compared to evaluate the variations. Though the basins are comparable in extent, they differ in respect of terrain characteristics and climate. The results suggest that ASTER and SRTM provide equally reliable representation of topography portrayed by TOPO and the topographic attributes extracted from the spaceborne DEMs are in agreement with those derived from TOPO. Despite the coarser resolution, SRTM shows relatively higher vertical accuracy (RMSE\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa023 and 20\xc2\xa0m respectively in MRB and PRB) compared to ASTER (RMSE\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa033 and 24\xc2\xa0m) and GMTED (RMSE\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa059 and 48\xc2\xa0m). Vertical accuracy of all the spaceborne DEMs is influenced by relief of the terrain as well as type of vegetation. Further, GMTED shows significant deviation for most of the attributes, indicating its inability for mountain-river-basin-scale studies.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe present study reports the efficacy of Mesua ferrea (Linn.) extract in mitigating radiation induced toxicity along with immunomodulatory property. Swiss albino mice, splenic lymphocytes and plasmid pBR322 DNA were used to evaluate the radioprotective effect by exposing them to 6Gy EBR or 4\xe2\x80\xafGy gamma radiation. In this study, Mesua ferrea methanolic (MfM) or aqueous extracts (MfA) significantly protected pBR322 DNA against radiation induced strand breaks. Both the extracts significantly offered protection against radiation-induced apoptosis as indicated by propidium iodide staining and DNA ladder assay. MfM or MfA significantly scavenged radiation derived free radicals indicating their antioxidant potential. MfM or MfA were orally administered to Swiss albino mice at 250 or200\xe2\x80\xafmg/kg body weight respectively for 7 days. The study showed significant increase in the levels of glutathione, and activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase & catalase. Administration of MfA or MfM to mice significantly reduced electron beam radiation (EBR; 6Gy) induced increase in MDA levels. Immunomodulatory efficacy of MfM and MfA was evaluated using concanavalin-A (Con-A) induced proliferation of CFSE labelled splenic lymphocytes. Both the extracts significantly reduced proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Further, MfM or MfA treatment prevented EBR induced histopathological changes in jejunum, spleen, liver and kidney. This demonstrates that the plant Mesua ferrea has promising antioxidant, radioprotective and immunomodulatory activity which may be attributed to the active constituents present in it.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe Eastern Ghats of India is well known for its wealth of natural vegetation and Shervaroy is a major hill range of the Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu. Ethnomedicinal studies in the Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu or the Shervaroy Hills have been carried out by various researchers. However, there is not much information available on ethnoveterinary medicine in the Eastern Ghats of India. The aim of this study was to examine the potential use of folk plants as alternative medicine for cattle to cure various diseases in the Shervaroy Hills of the Eastern Ghats. Based on interactions with traditional medicine practitioners, it has been observed that a total of 21 medicinal plants belonging to 16 families are used to cure various diseases such as mastitis, enteritis, arthritis, stomatitis, salivation from the mouth, wounding, and conjunctivitis in animals. It has been observed that the traditional knowledge of ethnoveterinary medicine is now confined only among the surviving older people and a few practitioners in the tribal communities of the Shervaroy Hills. Unfortunately, no serious attempts have been made to document and preserve this immense treasure of traditional knowledge.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractKundapallam watershed is located in Nilgiris District of south India. This ungauged watershed has an areal extension of 14.37 km2. There are increasing numbers of rainfall induced landslide occurrences in this area. The causes of rainfall induced landslides require a thorough understanding of runoff characteristics of the watershed. In this respect, the runoff of the study area is estimated with two approaches such as modified Soil Conservation Curve Number (SCS-CN) and Green-Ampt loss method. By these approaches, the related thematic factors on runoff characteristics are prepared with satellite images by using ARCGIS and IDRISI image processing software. The catchment delineation is generated for the Kundapallam watershed to get watershed parameters by using HEC-GeoHMS extension in ARCGIS. Curve number is assigned based on Soil Wetness Index (SWI). Sixteen soil samples were collected from different localities for the determination of hydraulic conductivity, moisture content, wetting front capillary pressure, bulk density, porosity etc. The infiltration rate of sample locations is determined by using double ring infiltrometer. Then all the parameters are assigned to models applied in this study to determine runoff characteristics of the study area. The accuracy and goodness of fit of the model are tested by determining the correlation coefficient (SCS-CN = 0.979 and Green-Ampt = 0.985) and coefficient determination (SCS-CN = 0.958 and Green-Ampt = 0.97) and it indicates statically positive correlations and perfect fit between the results of the study. The results showed that the modified SCS-CN provides low runoff estimation compared than Green-Ampt loss method.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe Kondapalli reserve forest (KRF) of the Eastern Ghats, India is subjected to severe anthropogenic interference, despite its status as reserve forest. The present research focuses on assessing the land use and land cover changes in and around KRF using temporal satellite data. It is evident from the current study that there has been a considerable decrease in the forest cover from 1990 to 2015; as seen from 2017 data, huge urban expansions and development activities were observed around KRF. This increase is linked to the growth in population, thereby consuming land available for their basic needs. To assess the rate of urban expansion around the forest, Land consumption rate and Land absorption coefficient were computed. The result of this analysis showed a rapid growth in built-up land between 1990 and 2017 while the periods between 1990 and 2015 witnessed a reduction in the forest class. Further, the study projected adverse impact of the growth of the new capital city-Amaravati on the KRF and proposed requiring suitable conservation measures with respect to its current deforestation and degradation trends.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Bat functional diversity was similar in shade coffee to protected forests.\xe2\x80\xa2Bat functional diversity was similar in forest fragments to protected forests.\xe2\x80\xa2Tea plantations retain far less bat functional diversity than shade grown coffee.\xe2\x80\xa2Large bats and bats with short, broad wings were filtered out in modified habitats.\xe2\x80\xa2Riparian corridors help retain bat functional diversity in a modified landscape.AbstractThe responses of bats to land-use change have been extensively studied in temperate zones and the neotropics, but little is known from the palaeotropics. Effective conservation in heavily-populated palaeotropical hotspots requires a better understanding of which bats can and cannot survive in human-modified landscapes. We used catching and acoustic transects to examine bat assemblages in the Western Ghats of India, and identify the species most sensitive to agricultural change. We quantified functional diversity and trait filtering of assemblages in forest fragments, tea and coffee plantations, and along rivers in tea plantations with and without forested corridors, compared to protected forests.Functional diversity in forest fragments and shade-grown coffee was similar to that in protected forests, but was far lower in tea plantations. Trait filtering was also strongest in tea plantations. Forested river corridors in tea plantations mitigated much of the loss of functional diversity and the trait filtering seen on rivers in tea plantations without forested corridors. The bats most vulnerable to intensive agriculture were frugivorous, large, had short broad wings, or made constant frequency echolocation calls. The last three features are characteristic of forest animal-eating species that typically take large prey, often by gleaning.Ongoing conservation work to restore forest fragments and retain native trees in coffee plantations should be highly beneficial for bats in this landscape. The maintenance of a mosaic landscape with sufficient patches of forest, shade-grown coffee and riparian corridors will help to maintain landscape wide functional diversity in an area dominated by tea plantations.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (218KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractEndophytic bacteria were isolated from the tissues of surface sterilized roots, stems, and leaves of fifty different crop plants. Phenotypic, biochemical tests and species-specific PCR assay permitted identification of four isolates of Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus from root tissues of carrot (Daucus carota L.), raddish (Raphanus sativus L.), beetroot (Beta vulgaris L.) and coffee (Coffea arabica L.). Further the plant growth promoting traits such as nitrogenase activity, production of phytohormone indole acetic acid (IAA), phosphorus and zinc solubilization were assessed. Significant nitrogenase activity was recorded among the isolates and all the isolates produced IAA in the presence of tryptophan. Though all the four isolates efficiently solubilized phosphorus, the zinc solubilizing ability differed among the isolates.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe ecological integrity is widely discussed as a new concept by several ecologists and environmentalists. A consensus in this regard is yet to be derived for its definition. Human intervention for its developmental activities results in several environmental changes that enhance some species, ecosystem and ecological processes while at the same time brings irrecoverable damage to the Planet Earth. It is essential and crucial to focus research and scientific analysis and establish awareness and education to provide a means of distinguishing responses between improvements in quality of ecosystem and those of damages. The focus of this paper is to emphasize the organized urban planning at a macro level and the architectural design interventions at the micro level in Vijayawada where eco \xe2\x80\x93 sensitivity exists with due consideration to ecological integrity and environmental protection. The ecological dynamics of continuity indicated that hillocks of Vijayawada region are a part of Eastern Ghats. The study is to elaborate that the landscape, eco-patches and its connectivity establishes a unique corridor to strengthen ecological system and as a green corridor to Vijayawada city to fulfill the demands of the city and also to create the ecological patch connectivity to scattered Eastern Ghats especially in the Krishna-Guntur region which connects the Nallamala hills through Kondapalli hill toward Sothern side and to the Papikondalu at the northern side of Eastern Ghats. These corridors may even support environmental conservation and provides rural edge in urban context and functions as lung spaces to ease the heat island effect of urban settlement. So the explicit development controls have been derived to guide and organize at micro level so as to achieve the macro level considerations of ecological integrity.'

Abstract: 'AbstractKodagu is one of the green districts in the Western Ghats, which contributes to a major share of coffee production in India with a rich cultural heritage, a significant part of which is a sustainable outlook in all aspects of life. The district is now witnessing a decline in its cultural and environmental vibrancy due to a number of reasons, notably, rapid urbanization, shift from the natural agricultural systems, destruction of the sacred groves, expansion of coffee plantations and reduction of the native green cover. The negative impact is indicated in various environmental statistical records. The College of Forestry, Ponnampet and University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore have proposed the Payment for Ecological Services through landscape labeling that could help alleviate the economic woes of the farmers and consequentially provide an opportunity to restore the ecological balance in Kodagu. The scope of the paper would be to investigate whether PES in conjunction with the cultural and social scenarios would be able to create a cultural renaissance in Kodagu.'

The data are consistent with the reportedly uncompensated nature of the EGMB, and indicate that the crust below the Rengali Province has a cratonic gravity signature. The contact between the two domains with distinct sub-surface structure, inferred from gravity data, coincides with the North Orissa Boundary Fault (NOBF) that defines the northern boundary of the Talchir Basin. Post-Gondwana faults are also localized along the northern margin of the basin, and present-day seismic tremors also have epicenters close to the NOBF. This indicates that the NOBF was formed by reactivation of a Neoproterozoic terrane boundary, and continues to be susceptible to seismic activity even at the present-day.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image'

Title: 'Original articleEvaluation of a labdane diterpene forskolin isolated from Solena amplexicaulis (Lam.) Gandhi (Cucurbitaceae) revealed promising antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic pharmacological properties'

Abstract: 'AbstractSolena amplexicaulis (Lam.) Gandhi (Family Cucurbitaceae) is one of the important plant species used by the Irula tribes of Walayar valley of southern Western Ghats, India for the management of diabetes. To confirm the antidiabetic property of S. amplexicaulis, the present study was addressed using crude methanolic leaf extract of S. amplexicaulis (MeOHSa) and its isolated compound, Forskolin against streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), blood glucose, lipid profile, serum liver markers, antioxidants, hemoglobin and glycogen were evaluated using standard procedure. The oral administration of Forskolin and MeOHSa (600\xe2\x80\xafmg/kg b.w.) for 30\xe2\x80\xafdays resulted in significant restoration of all these parameters supported by histopathological observations too. The results clearly suggest that the Forskolin (diterpene) possess potent antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic activities, which may be considered as a lead molecule for therapeutic purposes, and the source of Forskolin i.e. S. amplexicaulis can be further exploited for pharmaceutical industries.'

Among the two plateau ages, the first age of 66.56\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.42\xc2\xa0Ma from a dyke near Mohpani village represents its crystallization age which is either slightly older or contemporaneous with the nearby Mandla lava flows (63\xe2\x80\x9365\xc2\xa0Ma). We suggest that the Mohpani dyke might be one of the feeders for the surrounding lava flows as these lavas are significantly younger than the majority of the main Deccan lavas of the Western Ghats (66.38\xe2\x80\x9365.54\xc2\xa0Ma). The second age of 56.95\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.08\xc2\xa0Ma comes from a younger dyke near Olini village which cuts across the lava flows of the area. The age correlates well with the Mandla lavas which are chemically similar to the uppermost Poladpur, Ambenali and Mahabaleshwar Formation lavas of SW Deccan. Our study shows that the dyke activities occurred in two phases, with the second one representing the terminal stage.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (1MB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Original articleSapphirine granulites from Panasapattu, Eastern Ghats belt, India: Ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism in a Proterozoic convergent plate margin'

Abstract: 'AbstractWe report equilibrium sapphirine\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0quartz assemblage in biotite\xe2\x80\x93orthopyroxene\xe2\x80\x93garnet granulites from a new locality in Panasapattu of Paderu region in the Eastern Ghats granulite belt, which provide new evidence for ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) metamorphism at 1030\xe2\x80\x931050\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C and 10\xc2\xa0kbar in this region. The development of migmatitic texture, stabilization of the garnet\xe2\x80\x93orthopyroxene\xe2\x80\x93plagioclase\xe2\x80\x93K-feldspar association, prograde biotite inclusions within garnet and sapphirine as well as sapphirine and cordierite inclusions within garnet in these granulites indicate that the observed peak assemblages probably formed during prograde dehydration melting of a Bt\xe2\x80\x93Sill\xe2\x80\x93Qtz assemblage, and constrain the prograde stage of the p\xe2\x80\x93T path. The core domains of orthopyroxene porphyroblasts have up to w(Al2O3) 9.6%, which suggest that the temperatures reached up to 1150\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C suggesting extreme crustal metamorphism. These conditions were also confirmed by the garnet\xe2\x80\x93orthopyroxene thermobarometery, which yields a p\xe2\x80\x93T range of 1012\xe2\x80\x93960\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C and 9.4\xc2\xa0kbar. The p\xe2\x80\x93T phase topologies computed using isochemical sections calculated in the model system Na2O\xe2\x80\x93CaO\xe2\x80\x93K2O\xe2\x80\x93FeO\xe2\x80\x93MgO\xe2\x80\x93Al2O3\xe2\x80\x93SiO2\xe2\x80\x93H2O (NCKFMASH) for metapelites, garnet-free sapphirine granulites and garnet-bearing sapphirine granulites match the melt-bearing assemblages observed in these rocks. Isochemical sections constructed in the NCKFMASH system for an average sub-aluminous metapelite bulk composition, and contoured for modal proportions of melt and garnet, as well as for the compositional isopleths of garnet, predict phase and reaction relations that are consistent with those observed in the rocks. Garnet and orthopyroxene contain Ti-rich phlogopite inclusions, suggesting formation by prograde melting reactions at the expense of phlogopite during ultrahigh-temperature conditions. These p\xe2\x80\x93T results underestimate \xe2\x80\x98peak\xe2\x80\x99 conditions, in part as a result of the modification of garnet compositions in the domains where some melt was retained. The post-peak evolution is constrained by a succession of melt-present reactions that occur at p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa010\xc2\xa0kbar, inferred from micro-structural relations among various minerals. After high-temperature decompression from the metamorphic peak, the p\xe2\x80\x93T path followed a near isobaric cooling stage to T\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa0900\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C. The UHT rocks investigated in this study occur within a continental collision suture which witnessed prolonged subduction\xe2\x80\x93accretion history prior to the final collision. We correlate the extreme metamorphism and the stabilization of UHT mineral assemblages to heat and volatile input from an upwelled asthenosphere during subduction\xe2\x80\x93collision tectonics in a Proterozoic convergent plate margin.'

Title: 'Isolation and molecular characterization of actinomycetes with antimicrobial and mosquito larvicidal properties'
Author: 'Ganesan'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2314853516301494
Abstract: 'AbstractThe present study aimed to isolate actinomycetes from soil samples collected from Western Ghats regions, Tamil Nadu, India. Totally 400 actinomycetes isolates were isolated, of which 161 (40.2%) showed antimicrobial activity in preliminary screening. Secondary screening yielded 27 active isolates; twelve of them showed good antimicrobial and larvicidal activities. Five isolates namely S12-4, S12-17, S12-8, DPS-14 and FMS-20 presented 98%, 93%, 87%, 82%, and 80% larvicidal activity against Cx. quinquefasciatus; very low larvicidal activity was observed against Ae. aegypti. S12-4 showed 100% larval mortality against An. stephensi. RAPD results showed highest similarity between DPS-122 and KFS-24 (0.89246). The polymorphic index observed in the primers ranged from 0.286 (OPA-09) to 0.07 (OPC-18). The results suggest that Western Ghats regions may be a good natural source for isolation of actinobacteria and thereby for discovering novel molecules with antimicrobial and mosquito larvicidal properties.'

Title: 'Research PaperHydrogeological delineation of groundwater vulnerability to droughts in semi-arid areas of western Ahmednagar district'
Author: 'Renie'

Abstract: 'AbstractGroundwater, a renewable and finite natural resource, is a vital source of sustenance for humans and different ecosystems in the semi-arid regions. Rapid population growth in the last three decades has caused a rise in water demand which has inadvertently posed a stress on its availability. Occurrence of groundwater in the Deccan Volcanic Province is governed by the subsurface hydrogeological heterogeneity of basaltic lava flows and by the presence of geological structures like dykes, sills and fractures that influence spatial & vertical groundwater flow. The main objective of this paper is to map and assess areas that are naturally most susceptible to groundwater scarcity and at risk of depletion due to over extraction. The current study involves a field hydrogeological mapping that was integrated with remote sensing and GIS to delineate areas. This technique was based on using different thematic layers viz. lithology, slope, land-use and land cover, lineament, drainage, soil type, depth to groundwater and annual rainfall. Additionally, pumping tests were carried out to classify the study area into different hydrogeological typologies to help delineate communities that are most vulnerable to subsurface heterogeneity. This paper attempts to underline the groundwater scarcity zones based on different influencing thematic layers and provide a robust methodology to prioritize areas vulnerable to groundwater unavailability, by categorizing the study area into different vulnerable class types \xe2\x80\x93 extreme, high, moderate and low.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Five novel brevinin peptides were isolated from the frog Clinotarsus curtipes.\xe2\x80\xa2Most of them are haemolytic in nature but active against diverse bacterial strains.\xe2\x80\xa2Peptide B1CTcu4 can kill methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.\xe2\x80\xa2Cytoplasmic membrane depolarization and bacterial cell death are independent events.AbstractHPLC elution profile and MALDI TOF MS analysis of electro-stimulated skin secretion of the Indian Ranid frog Clinotarsus curtipes of the Western Ghats confirmed the presence of multiple peptides. Peptides eluted out of the C18 column at higher hydrophobic solvent region showed antibacterial activity against diverse bacterial strains, including the clinical isolates of V.\xc2\xa0cholerae and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Peptidomic analysis of the most potent chromatographic effluent fraction identified five novel peptide amides having sequence homology with brevinin family. These peptides are named as brevinin1CTcu1 (B1CTcu1) to brevinin1CTcu5 (B1CTcu5). Peptide B1CTcu1 is non-haemolytic while the others are haemolytic in nature but all elicited potential antibacterial activity. B1CTcu5 is a twenty-one residue peptide amide having proline hinge region in the middle and the typical C-terminal intramolecular disulfide-bridged hepta peptide domain (Rana box) that is present in most of the brevinin peptides. Analysis of their killing kinetics with E.\xc2\xa0coli and S.\xc2\xa0aureus and the ability to induce membrane depolarization proved that these are two independent events. These novel multifunctional peptides play an important role to protect C.\xc2\xa0curtipes from invading pathogenic microorganisms present in the environment.'

Abstract: "AbstractBackgroundMemecylon species are commonly used in Indian ethnomedical practices. The accurate identification is vital to enhance the drug's efficacy and biosafety. In the present study, PCR based techniques like RAPD, ISSR and DNA barcoding regions, such as 5s, psbA-trnH, rpoC1, ndh and atpF-atpH, were used to authenticate and analyze the diversity of five Memecylon species collected from Western Ghats of India.ResultsPhylogenetic analysis clearly distinguished Memecylon malabaricum from Memecylon wightii and Memecylon umbellatum from Memecylon edule and clades formed are in accordance with morphological keys. In the RAPD and ISSR analyses, 27 accessions representing five Memecylon species were distinctly separated into three different clades. M. malabaricum and M. wightii grouped together and M. umbellatum, M. edule and Memecylon talbotianum grouped in the same clade with high Jaccard dissimilarity coefficient and bootstrap support between each node, indicating that these grouped species are phylogenetically similar.ConclusionData from the present study reveals that chloroplast psbA-trnH region could be used as a potential candidate region for identifying Memecylon species, and ISSR marker system could be used for estimating genetic diversity since it has high percent polymorphism compared to RAPD marker."

Abstract: 'AbstractWater is essential for all living beings. It is a major concern to provide water to all. It is a challenge to supply water to all major cities in Dakshina Kannada district, Karnataka, India. Nethravathi River is one of the major sources of water in the region which yields about 1240TMC per year. Nethravathi River has its origins in Western Ghats of Karnataka flowing to a length of 126 Km and joins Arabian Sea. In Dakshina Kannada district all major cities face water scarcity in summer season even after getting an average annual rainfall of 3.75 \xe2\x80\x93 4.25 m. It is a major challenge to the district administration for providing required water to the people during summer season in spite of plenty of water available during monsoon. This paper highlights in giving solution to this issue after studying various parameters like geographical structure, rainfall data and climate, study of catchment area, storage methods, water demand and water supply schemes available in the region. An attempt has been made to suggest for supplying the water to the cities in Dakshina Kannada district by increasing the storage capacity on the upstream side of the river to get water round the clock.'

Title: 'Geoemyda silvatica, an enigmatic turtle of the Geoemydidae (Reptilia: Testudines), represents a distinct genus'
Author: 'Peter'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S143960920600002X
Abstract: 'AbstractThe systematic position of the rare Indian turtle Geoemyda silvatica Henderson is examined by a phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA sequence data (cytochrome-b gene) of most species of Geoemydidae. Geoemyda silvatica represents a basal and isolated taxon within Geoemydidae, definitely not a close relative of any species of Geoemyda or Heosemys, the genera in which G. silvatica has been placed in the past. Therefore, the new genus Vijayachelys is proposed for G. silvatica. Cranial morphology and some other osteological characters of Vijayachelys silvatica are described and illustrated. Differential diagnoses are given for the type species of Melanochelys and the respective type species of the superficially similar genera Geoemyda, Heosemys, and Leucocephalon. According to Bayesian analysis of mtDNA data, Melanochelys trijuga could be distantly related to V. silvatica, whereas the morphological similarity of the other species probably is the result of a similar mode of life. The discovery of the phylogenetically isolated position of V. silvatica highlights the importance of the Western Ghats as a biodiversity hotspot rich in higher-level endemics.'

Abstract: 'AbstractCurrently Streptomyces is one of the most important antibiotic producing microorganisms against several diseases. In the present study Streptomyces olivochromogenes ERINLG-261 was isolated from the soil samples of the Mudumalai hills, Western Ghats, India. Morphological, physiological, biochemical and 16S rRNA studies strongly suggested that this isolate belonged to the genus Streptomyces. ERINLG-261 showed good antimicrobial activity against different bacteria and fungi in Micromonospora fermentation medium. The active ethyl acetate extract was packed in column chromatography over silica gel which led to the isolation of 2-hydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone as the active principle. The isolated compound showed good antimicrobial activity against tested bacteria and fungi in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) studies. The compound showed moderate in vitro antiproliferative activity against A549 and COLO320 cells. The compound was subjected to molecular docking studies for the inhibition of Topoisomerase, TtgR and Beta-lactamase enzymes which are targets for antimicrobials. Docking results of the compound showed low docking energy with these enzymes indicating its usefulness as antimicrobial agent. This is the first report of antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of 2-hydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone isolated from Streptomyces olivochromogenes along with molecular docking studies.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractIn tropical forest conservation, areas with full statutory protection are often surrounded by buffer zones. Information on the patterns of tree community structure differences in these zones is helpful to evaluate the conservation efficacy. Our study was implemented within a biodiversity hotspot, in the Ta Xua Nature Reserve of north-western Vietnam, which has a statutorily protected core zone and a buffer zone, where local H\xe2\x80\x99Mong people are permitted low intensity forest use. The forests are rich in tree species (249 observed). Many of these tree species provide non-timber forest products (NTFPs) (48%) or valuable timber (22%), and 18 species are red-listed. Overall tree density was not different in the two zones, but tree diameter and species richness were lower in the buffer zone. At the tree level, logistic regression analysis indicated that red-listed status, large diameter, and low density of conspecifics increased the probability of tree absence from the buffer zone but not the potential use as a NTFP. However, most NTFP species had different densities in the core and buffer zones, and this correlated with signs of human interference. At the species level, the density of species was the most important variable, and rarity strongly increased the probability of species absence. Our results also indicate that rare and red-listed trees were depleted in the buffer zone. In consideration of conservation goals, the future monitoring of these species at the Ta Xua Nature Reserve and other protected areas is needed, and conservation measures most likely need to be improved.'

Abstract: 'AbstractSince its original description, the Indian treefrog species Polypedates variabilis Jerdon, 1853 has been assigned variously to one of the widespread genera Polypedates Tschudi, 1832, Rhacophorus Kuhl & van Hasselt, 1822, and Philautus (Kirtixalus) Dubois, 1987. Here we present phylogenetic analyses based on 1.4\xc2\xa0kb of mitochondrial DNA showing that P. variabilis and a previously undescribed relative are not nested within any of those genera, but stem from a lineage that originated relatively early in the rhacophorid radiation. We propose the name Ghatixalus gen. n. for this lineage, whose known members are restricted to high altitudes in the Western Ghats of India. The sister species of G. variabilis (Jerdon), comb. n. is described as Ghatixalus asterops sp. n. The morphological and ecological features of both species are discussed.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Proterozoic convergences and rifting are suggested in case of Aravalli, Satpura and Eastern Ghat.\xe2\x80\xa2NE\xe2\x80\x93SW directed stress with N\xe2\x80\x93S and E\xe2\x80\x93W directed convergences are indicated along these fold belts.\xe2\x80\xa2Plume caused rifting of cratons during Paleo\xe2\x80\x93Mesoproterozoic Columbia supercontinent breakup.AbstractThe Aravalli\xe2\x80\x93Delhi and Satpura Mobile Belts (ADMB and SMB) and the Eastern Ghat Mobile Belt (EGMB) in India form major Proterozoic mobile belts with adjoining cratons and contemporary basins. The most convincing features of the ADMB and the SMB have been the crustal layers dipping from both sides in opposite directions, crustal thickening (\xe2\x88\xbc45\xc2\xa0km) and high density and high conductivity rocks in upper/lower crust associated with faults/thrusts. These observations indicate convergence while domal type reflectors in the lower crust suggest an extensional rifting phase. In case of the SMB, even the remnant of the subducting slab characterized by high conductive and low density slab in lithospheric mantle up to \xe2\x88\xbc120\xc2\xa0km across the Purna\xe2\x80\x93Godavari river faults has been traced which may be caused by fluids due to metamorphism. Subduction related intrusives of the SMB south of it and the ADMB west of it suggest N\xe2\x80\x93S and E\xe2\x80\x93W directed convergence and subduction during Meso\xe2\x80\x93Neoproterozoic convergence. The simultaneous E\xe2\x80\x93W convergence between the Bundelkhand craton and Marwar craton (Western Rajasthan) across the ADMB and the N\xe2\x80\x93S convergence between the Bundelkhand craton and the Bhandara and Dharwar cratons across the SMB suggest that the forces of convergence might have been in a NE\xe2\x80\x93SW direction with E\xe2\x80\x93W and N\xe2\x80\x93S components in the two cases, respectively. This explains the arcuate shaped collision zone of the ADMB and the SMB which are connected in their western part. The Eastern Ghat Mobile Belt (EGMB) also shows signatures of E\xe2\x80\x93W directed Meso\xe2\x80\x93Neoproterozoic convergence with East Antarctica similar to ADMB in north India. Foreland basins such as Vindhyan (ADMB\xe2\x80\x93SMB), and Kurnool (EGMB) Supergroups of rocks were formed during this convergence. Older rocks such as Aravalli (ADMB), Mahakoshal\xe2\x80\x93Bijawar (SMB), and Cuddapah (EGMB)\xc2\xa0Supergroups of rocks with several basic/ultrabasic intrusives along these mobile belts, plausibly formed during an earlier episode of rifting during Paleo\xe2\x80\x93Mesoproterozoic period. They are highly disturbed and deformed due to subsequent Meso\xe2\x80\x93Neoproterozoic convergence. As these Paleoproterozoic basins are characterized by large scale basic/ultrabasic intrusives that are considerably wide spread, it is suggested that a plume/superplume might have existed under the Indian cratons at that time which was responsible for the breakup of these cratons. Further, the presence of older intrusives in these mobile belts suggests that there might have been some form of convergence also during Paleoproterozoic period.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe Deccan trap is a large igneous rock province located on the Deccan plateau of west-central India. There are several important structures located on Deccan trap basalt like Koyna dam hydropower project, Konkan railways, Katraj twin tunnels to name a few. In order to safeguard the structures from dynamic loading arising from manmade or natural disastrous circumstances, it becomes necessary to characterize the dynamic behavior of rocks. In the present work, experimental studies have been performed to determine the dynamic stress-strain behavior of Deccan trap basalt rock as the same is not yet available in literature. The rock samples have been collected from various regions spread along the Western Ghats in Maharashtra. Tests have been performed to determine the physical and static mechanical properties. The dynamic tests have been carried out using 20 mm diameter split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) at different strain-rates. From the analysis of results, the dynamic stress-strain response of the rocks, force equilibrium and dependence of dynamic strength on the strain rate have been examined for the first time.'

The Capricorn Orogen of Western Australia also shows three episodes of orogeny: Opthalmian\xe2\x80\x93Glenburgh Orogeny (2100\xe2\x80\x931950\xc2\xa0Ma), Capricorn Orogeny (\xe2\x88\xbc1800\xc2\xa0Ma) and Mangaroon Orogeny (\xe2\x88\xbc1650\xc2\xa0Ma), and basin opening and closing related to these tectonic movements. These broad similarities suggest their joint evolution possibly in a near neighbour position during Paleoproterozoic Era. In view of juxtaposition of the Western Australia along the east coast of India, at the position of the Eastern Ghats, during Archean, it is suggested that the breaking of this Archean megacraton at \xe2\x88\xbc2400\xc2\xa0Ma led to northward movement of the broken components and formation of the Satpura\xe2\x80\x93Capricorn Orogen (at \xe2\x88\xbc2100 and \xe2\x88\xbc1800\xc2\xa0Ma) due to the collision of cratonic blocks with the pre-existing northern cratonic nuclei of India and Western Australia. This is also the time of formation of the supercontinent Columbia. A phase of basin opening followed the \xe2\x88\xbc1800\xc2\xa0Ma event, followed by another phase of collisional event at \xe2\x88\xbc1600\xc2\xa0Ma at the site of the Satpura\xe2\x80\x93Capricorn Orogen. Subsequent evolutions of the Satpura and the Capricorn Orogens differ slightly, indicating separate evolutional history.'

Vulnerability of forests under \xe2\x80\x98current climate\xe2\x80\x99 scenario is assessed by adopting indicator-based approach, while the vulnerability under \xe2\x80\x98future climate\xe2\x80\x99 scenario is assessed using climate and vegetation impact models. Based on the vulnerability index estimated to present the vulnerability of forests under current and projected climate change impacts representing climate driven vulnerability, five districts \xe2\x80\x93 Chamba, Kangra, Kullu, Mandi and Shimla are identified as priority forest districts for adaptation planning. Identifying vulnerable forest districts and forests will help policy makers and forest managers to prioritize resource allocation and forest management interventions, to restore health and productivity of forests and to build long-term resilience to climate change.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Alleppy platform (AP) developed during Oligocene-Miocene period.\xe2\x80\xa2AP is associated with basement high & delimited by Vishnu Fracture Zone (VFZ).\xe2\x80\xa2Gravity derived Moho configuration supports that AP could be continental fragment.\xe2\x80\xa2AP and VFZ had significant impact on the sedimentation pattern in the basin.AbstractThe Alleppey Platform is an important morphological feature located in the Kerala-Konkan basin off the southwest coast of India. In the present study, seismic reflection data available in the basin were used to understand the sedimentation history and also to carry out integrated gravity interpretation. Detailed seismic reflection data in the basin reveals that: (1) the Alleppey Platform is associated with a basement high in the west of its present-day geometry (as observed in the time-structure map of the Trap Top (K/T boundary)), (2) the platform subsequently started developing during the Eocene period and attained the present geometry by the Miocene and, (3) both the Alleppey platform and the Vishnu fracture zone have had significant impact on the sedimentation patterns (as shown by the time-structure and the isochron maps of the major sedimentary horizons in the region). The 3-D sediment gravity effect computed from the sedimentary layer geometry was used to construct the crustal Bouguer anomaly map of the region. The 3-D gravity inversion of crustal Bouguer anomaly exhibits a Moho depression below the western border of the platform and a minor rise towards the east which then deepens again below the Indian shield. The 2-D gravity modelling across the Alleppey platform reveals the geometry of crustal extension, in which there are patches of thin and thick crust. The Vishnu Fracture Zone appears as a crustal-scale feature at the western boundary of the Alleppey platform. Based on the gravity model and the seismic reflection data, we suggest that the basement high to the west of the present day Alleppey platform remained as a piece of continental block very close to the mainland with the intervening depression filling up with sediments during the rifting. In order to place the Alleppey platform in the overall perspective of tectonic evolution of the Kerala-Konkan basin, we propose its candidature as a continental fragment.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (414KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractA comprehensive methodology that integrates Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques was adopted to determine the soil erosion vulnerability of a forested mountainous sub-watershed in Kerala, India. The spatial pattern of annual soil erosion rate was obtained by integrating geo-environmental variables in a raster based GIS method. GIS data layers including, rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodability (K), slope length and steepness (LS), cover management (C) and conservation practice (P) factors were computed to determine their effects on average annual soil loss in the area. The resultant map of annual soil erosion shows a maximum soil loss of 17.73\xc2\xa0t h-1 y-1 with a close relation to grass land areas, degraded forests and deciduous forests on the steep side-slopes (with high LS). The spatial erosion maps generated with RUSLE method and GIS can serve as effective inputs in deriving strategies for land planning and management in the environmentally sensitive mountainous areas.'

Abstract: "AbstractThe hyporheic zones constitute a major site of storage of organic matter and energy flow in freshwater ecosystems. To complement the studies carried out in North America and Europe, we evaluated the sediment quality and occurrence of aquatic hyphomycetes in coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM; \xe2\x89\xa55\xc2\xa0mm) and fine particulate matter (FPM; \xe2\x89\xa41\xc2\xa0mm) in three locations of Kaiga stream and eight locations of Kadra dam of the River Kali in Western Ghats. The pH of sediments of stream and dam was acidic (5.8\xe2\x80\x936.6) and the average organic carbon of stream sediments was higher than dam sediments (8.6% vs. 3.9%). Among the eight minerals monitored, Fe was highest in all sediments and Ni was below detectable limit in four dam sediments. Spores of aquatic hyphomycetes were directly released from the CPOM fractions of sediments upon bubble chamber incubation, while the FPM fractions produced spores indirectly by colonization of sterile leaf baits followed by bubble chamber incubation. The species richness and diversity in CPOM was higher than FPM in stream as well as dam sediments. The Sorensen's similarity indices between the fungal flora of CPOM in stream (66.7\xe2\x80\x9381.8%) and dam (69.2\xe2\x80\x9388%) locations were generally higher than FPM. The spore output per mg CPOM was between 1215 (dam) and 3384 (stream). The species richness was negatively correlated with Cr (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01; r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x921.000) of stream sediments, while it was negatively correlated with organic carbon (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05; r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x920.740) and positively correlated with K (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05; r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.750) of dam sediments. Occurrence and survival of aquatic hyphomycetes in hyporheic habitats of freshwater bodies indicate the importance of such zones as reservoir of fungal inoculum necessary in fundamental functions such as organic matter processing and energy flow. The present study provides baseline data on the sediment quality and fungal composition of stream and dam locations of River Kali of Kaiga region, which will develop as center of industrial activities in future."

Here, we report new geochronological data on detrital zircons in metasediments associated with the magmatic rocks from the LHC, and compare the age spectra with those in the adjacent terranes for evaluating the tectonic correlation of East Antarctica and Sri Lanka. Cores of detrital zircon grains with high Th/U ratio in eight metasediment samples can be subdivided into two dominant groups: (1) late Meso- to Neoproterozoic (1.1\xe2\x80\x930.63\xc2\xa0Ga) zircons from the northeastern part of the LHC in Prince Olav Coast and northern S\xc3\xb4ya Coast areas, and (2) dominantly Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic (2.8\xe2\x80\x932.4\xc2\xa0Ga) zircons from the southwestern part of the LHC in southern L\xc3\xbctzow-Holm Bay area. The ca. 1.0\xc2\xa0Ga and ca. 2.5\xc2\xa0Ga magmatic suites in the LHC could be proximal provenances of the detrital zircons in the northeastern and southwestern LHC, respectively. Subordinate middle to late Mesoproterozoic (1.3\xe2\x80\x931.2\xc2\xa0Ga) detrital zircons obtained from Akarui Point and Langhovde could have been derived from adjacent Gondwana fragments (e.g., Rayner Complex, Eastern Ghats Belt). Meso- to Neoproterozoic domains such as Vijayan and Wanni Complexes of Sri Lanka, the southern Madurai Block of southern India, and the central-western Madagascar could be alternative distal sources of the late Meso- to Neoproterozoic zircons. Paleo- to Mesoarchean domains in India, Africa, and Antarctica might also be distal sources for the minor \xe2\x88\xbc2.8\xc2\xa0Ga detrital zircons from Skallevikshalsen. The detrital zircons from the Highland Complex of Sri Lanka show similar Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic (ca. 2.5\xc2\xa0Ga) and Neoproterozoic (ca. 1.0\xc2\xa0Ga) ages, which are comparable with those of the LHC, suggesting that the two complexes might have formed under similar tectonic regimes. We consider that the Highland Complex and metasedimentary unit of the LHC formed a unified latest Neoproterozoic suture zone with a large block of northern LH\xe2\x80\x93Vijayan Complex caught up as remnant of the ca. 1.0\xc2\xa0Ga magmatic arc.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (398KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractSwarnamukhi is an east flowing river having a total length of 130\xc2\xa0km. This is an independent river which rises at an elevation of 300\xc2\xa0m in the eastern Ghats ranges near Pakala village in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, India. This study was carried out using multitemporal satellite images of IRS P6 LISS-III and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data from 2011 to 2015. The subsequent short term river mouth dynamics, coastal erosion and accretion rates have been calculated for the years between 2011 and 2015. Low river inflow, wind, tides, movement of the waves and littoral currents play a key role in the dynamic activities of erosion and accretion. The erosion rate from 2011 to 2015 was slightly decreased from 0.081 to 0.027\xc2\xa0km2. The total net rate of accretion was estimated at 0.438\xc2\xa0km2. The study shows during last five years (2011\xe2\x80\x932015) accretion is more than the erosion. High fluctuation of erosion and accretion are characteristics for the short term scale at river mouth.'

Abstract: 'AbstractMonitoring the changes in forest-cover and understanding the dynamics of the forest is becoming increasingly important for the sustainable management of forest ecosystems. This paper uses temporal MODIS Vegetation Continuous Field (MODIS-VCF) to monitor the tree cover change in the Indian region over a period of 6\xc2\xa0years (2000\xe2\x80\x932005). Pixel-based linear regression model is developed to identify rate of deforestation and fragmentation at landscape level. The regression parameters viz., slope, offset and variance are used to identify threshold between forest and non-forest classes. The classification algorithm resulted into change area, no change area, positive change and negative changes. MODIS-VCF raw product of 2005 was validated using the field data and showed a coefficient of determination (R2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.85) between percent tree cover and individual plot wise canopy cover information. The results were overlaid with UNEP protected area boundary. On a long-term basis, the forest cover change was monitored using medium spatial resolution (Landsat and IRS) satellite data to identify the rate of deforestation and fragmentation at landscape level. The developed approach is efficient and effective for regional monitoring of forest cover change. It could be automated for regular usage and monitoring.'

In contrast, detrital zircons from the Cycle III Sullavai Group red sandstones yielded a maximum depositional age of 970\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa020\xc2\xa0Ma and had age peaks of \xe2\x88\xbc2550\xc2\xa0Ma, \xe2\x88\xbc1600\xc2\xa0Ma and then a number of Mesoproterozoic detrital zircons terminating in three analyses at \xe2\x88\xbc970\xc2\xa0Ma.

Over this period an increasing proportion of cases were identified only at late stage, suggestive of a major delay in patient identification for referral and diagnosis that urgently needs to be addressed.AbstractIntroductionSleeping sickness or Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a neglected tropical disease of public health importance across much of Sub-Saharan Africa. In Uganda, chronic T. b. gambiense HAT (gHAT) and acute T. b. rhodesiense HAT (rHAT) occur in two large but discrete geographical foci. Both forms are difficult to diagnose, expensive to treat and ultimately fatal in the absence of treatment. The area affected by zoonotic rHAT has been steadily expanding, placing a high burden on local health systems. HAT is a disease of neglected populations and is notorious for being under-reported. Here we examine the factors that influence passive rHAT surveillance within the district health system in four Ugandan districts into which the disease had recently been introduced, focusing on staff knowledge, infrastructure and data management.MethodsA mixed methods study was undertaken between 2011 and 2013 in Dokolo, Kaberamaido, Soroti and Serere districts to explore health facility capacity and clinical service provision, diagnostic capacity, HAT knowledge and case reporting. Structured interviews were undertaken with 86 medical personnel, including clinicians, nurses, midwives and technicians across 65 HC-II and HC-III medical facilities, where the health infrastructure was also directly observed. Eleven semi-structured interviews were undertaken with medical staff in each of the three designated HAT treatment facilities (Dokolo, Lwala and Serere HC-IV) in the area. HAT treatment centre case records, collected between 2009 and 2012, were analyzed.ResultsMost medical staff in HC-II and HC-III facilities had been made aware of HAT from radio broadcasts, newspapers and by word of mouth, suggestive of a lack of formal training. Key knowledge as regards the causative agent, clinical signs and that HAT drugs are provided free of charge was lower amongst HC-II than HC-III staff. Many respondents did not know whether HAT was endemic in their district. In rHAT specialist treatment centres, staff were knowledgeable of HAT and were confident in their ability to diagnose and manage cases. Between 2009\xe2\x80\x932012, 342 people were diagnosed in the area, 54% in the late stage of the disease. Over the period of this study the proportion of rHAT cases identified in early stage fell and by 2012 the majority of cases identified were diagnosed in the late stage.ConclusionThis study illustrates the critical role of the district health system in HAT management. The increasing proportion of cases identified at a late stage in this study indicates a major gap in lower tier levels in patient referral, diagnosis and reporting that urgently needs to be addressed. Integrating HAT diagnosis into national primary healthcare programs and providing training to medical workers at all levels is central to the new 2030 WHO HAT elimination goal. Given the zoonotic nature of rHAT, joined up active surveillance in human and animal populations in Uganda is also needed. The role of the Coordinating Office for Control of Trypanosomiasis in Uganda in implementing a One Health approach will be key to sustainable management of zoonotic HAT.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (212KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractFrom the ancient time, the Northeast part of India is rich in biodiversity because of its diverse topographic, climatic features. Different varieties of mammalian, avian, and herpetofauna are endemic to this region. Unfortunately, life of this diverse flora and fauna is in jeopardy due to serious anthropogenic pressure. Once a large number of globally important species sustained in the Barak Valley. However, with the increasing population and subsequent demand on natural resources and developing activities, many of the species are no more found in the valley. If the conservation action is not initiated, the remaining species will also vanish with time. This article highlights the distribution and conservation problems of four endangered species in the Barak Valley of Assam, India and recommended conservation tactics.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2This article reports occupational exposure of cashew nut workers to Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) in Goa, India.\xe2\x80\xa2KFD was confirmed in cashew nut workers from Belgaum, Karnataka, India.\xe2\x80\xa2E gene sequence analysis showed highest identity with KFD virus strains reported from Goa.\xe2\x80\xa2There is a need to develop surveillance and vaccination policies for workers at high risk.AbstractA series of suspected cases of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) in subjects returning to Belgaum in Karnataka State from Goa, India, is reported herein. KFD was confirmed in 13 out of 76 cases, either by real time RT-PCR or IgM ELISA. No case fatality was recorded. KFD virus positivity was also recorded among humans and monkeys from Sattari taluk in Goa during the same period. The envelope gene sequence of positive human samples from Belgaum showed highest identity of 99.98% to 99.99% with sequences of KFD virus isolated from human cases and monkeys from Goa. KFD activity has been reported from Goa among humans and monkeys since 2015. However, it has not been reported from Belgaum to date. These findings suggest that the cases (migrant laborers) contracted infection during cashew nut harvesting from KFD-affected Keri village, Sattari taluk, Goa and became ill after or during migration from the affected area to their native residence.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe claim of aesthetic modernity arriving before social modernity (1) is being investigated with reference to \xe2\x80\x98intense experiments of city-making\xe2\x80\x99 in Kolkata. This brings into focus the socio-political inclination of packaging cities to fit a \xe2\x80\x98global image of efficiency\xe2\x80\x99. Here a deliberate attempt is made to look for specific geo-political appropriation and/or reproduction and/or rejection of both the global and the traditional aesthetic- thus identifying role of aesthetic convictions of the masses, the bourgeoisie and the State, in Asian experiments of worlding cities (2). The recent tendency in urban studies to locate the geography of authoritative knowledge in specific cases of the Global South is the context of this study (2). The paper would touch upon three beautification projects of Kolkata, at different stages of the post 90-s neo-liberalization era. The subversive claims of the politically conscious masses juxtaposed with the refusal of middle-class global aspirations to remain in the \xe2\x80\x98waiting rooms of history\xe2\x80\x99 (3) and simultaneous knee-jerk policies to compete for global capital provide an interesting case. Kolkata, both suffering from and celebrating its poignant urbanscape- presents a specific referent of how 21st century Indian cities are not just borrowing Western urban aesthetics but are \xe2\x80\x98inevitably home-grown\xe2\x80\x99 in their construction of appropriate aesthetics. The attempt here is limited to an examination of the desired image of the city, politically defined but socially negotiated, as a locus of possibilities, thus recognising the creativity and violence of space-making in Kolkata as a source of broadly relevant urban theory.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Unique volcanic structures with radial joint columns and flow-top-breccia cores.\xe2\x80\xa2Previously thought to form by FTB somehow sinking into molten flow interior.\xe2\x80\xa2Our model based on rubbly pahoehoe inflation and transitional character to \xe2\x80\x98a\xe2\x80\x99\xc4\x81.\xe2\x80\xa2FTB rubble dropped by thick lava flow incorporated by itself during advance.\xe2\x80\xa2Roughly spherical isotherms around cold FTB inclusions produce radial jointing.AbstractRubbly pahoehoe lava flows are abundant in many continental flood basalts including the Deccan Traps. However, structures with radial joint columns surrounding cores of flow-top breccia (FTB), reported from some Deccan rubbly pahoehoe flows, are yet unknown from other basaltic provinces. A previous study of these Deccan \xe2\x80\x9cbreccia-cored columnar rosettes\xe2\x80\x9d ruled out explanations such as volcanic vents and lava tubes, and showed that the radial joint columns had grown outwards from cold FTB inclusions incorporated into the hot molten interiors. How the highly vesicular (thus low-density) FTB blocks might have sunk into the flow interiors has remained a puzzle. Here we describe a new example of a Deccan rubbly pahoehoe flow with FTB-cored rosettes, from Elephanta Island in the Mumbai harbor. Noting that (1) thick rubbly pahoehoe flows probably form by rapid inflation (involving many lava injections into a largely molten advancing flow), and (2) such flows are transitional to \xe2\x80\x98a\xe2\x80\x99\xc4\x81 flows (which continuously shed their top clinker in front of them as they advance), we propose a model for the FTB-cored rosettes. We suggest that the Deccan flows under study were shedding some of their FTB in front of them as they advanced and, with high-eruption rate lava injection and inflation, frontal breakouts would incorporate this FTB rubble, with thickening of the flow carrying the rubble into the flow interior. This implies that, far from sinking into the molten interior, the FTB blocks may have been rising, until lava supply and inflation stopped, the flow began solidifying, and joint columns developed outward from each cold FTB inclusion as already inferred, forming the FTB-cored rosettes. Those rubbly pahoehoe flows which began recycling most of their FTB became the \xe2\x80\x98a\xe2\x80\x99\xc4\x81 flows of the Deccan.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (532KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractUrban planning is a tool, which enables in managing changes within a spatial approach. It helps in conducting planning activities where the economic, environmental, and social goals are taken care of holistically. Planning process involves studying past trends, learning from past and present, and then preparing a proposal for future. This process mostly assesses the trend of growth and plans for development. A trend follows change in a defined rate. An indefinite or unexpected change spoils the planning process, by breaking the trend of growth. City is known for its resources, geography, population, social-culture structure, economy etc. Whenever there is an unexpected change in any of these parameters, the city undergoes remarkable changes. Disaster also brings hasty changes in all these, which is indeed a challenge to urban planning and design. The fast modernization and adoption of western culture leads to significant changes in socio-cultural and economic spheres. City also changes, when rapid movement of people and resources occur. Tourism industry in this decade brought many changes is Indian cities. It diversifies social and cultural identity of the city and generates tremendous opportunity for economic development. Therefore cities having tourism potential are facing urban planning problems. Exploring these issues and reasons behind it will be helpful to minimize its impact. Tourism cities have tremendous potential of research in this direction. The need of the decade for urban planners and designers is to be prepared for the changes in a tourist city.'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa264 water samples were collected out of which 37 water samples were having iron content beyond permissible limit of 300\xc2\xa0ppb.\xe2\x80\xa2The maximum iron content was found to be 6294\xc2\xa0ppb in Gangan river water near Fazalpur industrial area.\xe2\x80\xa2The local residents have given the feedback that either the water is yellow in colour as available or it turns yellow on storage.AbstractIn India, the district of Moradabad lies between 28\xc2\xb021\xe2\x80\xb2 to 28\xc2\xb016\xe2\x80\xb2 north latitude and 78\xc2\xb04\xe2\x80\xb2 to 79\xc2\xb0 east longitude in western Uttar Pradesh. The city is known for its export of brass handicrafts to various countries across the world including North America and Europe and is also known as Peetal Nagri (Brass City). A field survey was conducted in district Moradabad along with a public interaction program on water related problems. A total of 108 representative villages covering all eight blocks of Moradabad district were visited and interactions were held with the local population to find out the status of drinking water quality and associated problems. The previous studies on surface and groundwater quality assessment of Moradabad district did not cover the entire area or present the water quality awareness amongst the local population despite of the repeatedly complains about the yellow colour of water.Water quality of surface and groundwater has been assessed with respect to metal concentration using ICP-OES technique. Out of the 64 water samples collected, copper, arsenic, lead and chromium concentrations were always within the permissible limits. While iron concentration, more than 50% of the samples were beyond permissible limit. Maximum iron level in groundwater sample was 3820\xc2\xa0ppb and that in surface water sample was 6294\xc2\xa0ppb whereas the permissible limit is 300\xc2\xa0ppb.The overload of iron may cause severe health problems such as liver cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis of liver, diseases related to heart and central nervous system, infertility etc. The presence of high concentration of iron leads to adverse changes in colour, odour and taste of water and it also stains clothes and utensils. However, the local health authority's records are not available."

Title: 'Managing Flood Flows for Crop Production Risk Management with Hydraulic and GIS Modeling: Case study of Agricultural Areas in Shariatpur'
Author: 'A.A.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221267081200053X
Abstract: "AbstractShariatpur District, under Dhaka division with an area of 1181.53 sq km, is mainly surrounded by the two big rivers, the Padma at north and the Meghna at eastern side. Also, the Arial Khan River is located at the south western side of the district. When the Padma and the Meghna Rivers attain peak flood levels simultaneously, this district faces devastating floods. These floods have a destructive effect on agriculture especially on Aman (June- September) variety at optimum level of flood depth but also have a positive impact on next year's Boro (December- march) production due to sedimentation by the previous year's flood. So there is a scope of managing flood flows which ensures the optimum level of flood depth that promotes the crop production risk management. The present study provides a method for flood management aiming to crop production risk management. In this study, inundation maps have been produced using hydrodynamic model HEC-RAS and HEC-GeoRAS extension of ArcGIS9.2. Then calculation of optimal flood depth for crop production risk management has been done using some sophisticated statistical analysis. Finally, volume of water above the optimal flood depth has been calculated using GIS model with ArcGIS 9.2 and based on this, proposed some ways of flood flows management which ensure the crop production risk management. The study findings show that, the optimal flood depth is 1.85m (msl) in where Boro production would be safe and Aman production would face about 200 ton/yr loss, we can called this condition as crop production as farmers get more return from Boro variety. This study also find two equations that provide estimation of Mawa discharge depending on two upstream stations (Hardings Bridge and Bahadurabad Ghat) and targeted discharge of Mawa that needs to release from Mawa to the study area for ensuring the optimum flood depth."

Using metamorphic reaction textures, mineral chemistry, metamorphic reaction history, geothermobarometric computations and electron microprobe dating of monazite in 5 samples of pelitic granulite, leptynite gneiss, enderbite and charnockite, we have deduced a medium-pressure granulite facies metamorphism (P between 4.9 and 6.8\xc2\xa0kbar, T\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0760\xe2\x80\x93815\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C) along a heating-cooling, counterclockwise P-T path between 1.09 and 1.01\xc2\xa0Ga.

Amboori is a tropical area that is highly vulnerable to landslides. The 2, 3, and 5-day antecedent rainfall data versus daily rainfall was clustered to identify a cluster of critical events that could potentially trigger landslides. Further, the cluster of critical events was utilized for regression analysis to develop the threshold equations. The 5-day antecedent (x-variable) vs. daily rainfall (y-variable) provided the best fit to the data with a threshold equation of y\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa080.7\xe2\x80\x930.1981x. The intercept of the equation indicates that if the 5-day antecedent rainfall is zero, the minimum daily rainfall needed to trigger the landslide in the Amboori region would be 80.7\xc2\xa0mm. The negative coefficient of the antecedent rainfall indicates that when the cumulative antecedent rainfall increases, the amount of daily rainfall required to trigger monsoon landslide decreases. The coefficient value indicates that the contribution of the 5-day antecedent rainfall is \xe2\x88\xbc20% to the landslide trigger threshold. The slope stability analysis carried out for the area, using Probabilistic Infinite Slope Analysis Model (PISA-m), was utilized to identify the areas vulnerable to landslide in the region. The locations in the area where past landslides have occurred demonstrate lower Factors of Safety (FS) in the slope stability analysis. Thus, rainfall threshold analysis together with the FS values from slope stability can be suitable for developing a simple, cost-effective, and comprehensive early-warning system for shallow landslides in Amboori and similar regions.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (393KB)Download full-size image'

Author: 'B.C. Kumar'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214241X15001753
Abstract: 'AbstractInformation on the spatial distribution of Hydrologically Active Areas (HAAs) in a watershed is an important input for many applications, such as hydrological modeling, water resource planning and flood estimation. HAAs can be delineated using a wetness index derived from either a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) or from satellite data. The purpose of this study was to develop and apply a methodology to delineate the HAAs in the Harangi (535 km2) and Hemavathy (2974 km2) watersheds located in Karnataka, India. Spatial distributions of HAAs derived from the DEM and from satellite data (Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor) were compared. It was found that wetness index obtained from satellite data was better able to capture the HAAs in comparison to the use of DEM. The delineated HAAs will be useful in identifying runoff generation areas and improve process representation in distributed hydrological modeling of the watershed.'

Abstract: 'AbstractParalysis is the loss of the ability of one or more muscles to move, due to disruption of signaling between the nervous system and muscles. The most common causes of paralysis are stroke, head injury, spinal cord injury (SCI) and multiple sclerosis. The search for cure of paralysis is yet to be found. Many ethnobotanical surveys have reported the use of medicinal plants by various ethnic communities in treating and curing paralysis. The present review discusses the use of medicinal plants in India for ameliorating and curing paralytic conditions, as well as discuses some of the important developments in future possible applications of medicinal plants in treatment of paralysis. This review reports the use of 37 medicinal plants for their application and cure of ailments related to paralysis. Out of the 37 plants documented, 11 plants have been reported for their ability to cure paralysis. However, the information on the documented plants were mostly found to be inadequate, requiring proper authentication with respect to their specificity, dosage, contradictions etc. It is found that despite the claims presented in many ethnobotanical surveys, the laboratory analysis of these plants remain untouched. It is believed that with deeper intervention on analysis of bioactive compounds present in these plants used by ethic traditional healers for paralysis, many potential therapeutic compounds can be isolated for this particular ailment in the near future.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (249KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2RUSLE used to estimate soil loss in a coastal river basin.\xe2\x80\xa2Remote sensing data helped in land use-land cover classification.\xe2\x80\xa2GIS helped to integrate, analyse and map potential soil erosion zones.\xe2\x80\xa2RUSLE model utilizing remote sensing and GIS useful for soil erosion probability prediction.AbstractSoil erosion is a serious problem arising from agricultural intensification, land degradation and other anthropogenic activities. Assessment of soil erosion is useful in planning and conservation works in a watershed or basin. Modelling can provide a quantitative and consistent approach to estimate soil erosion and sediment yield under a wide range of conditions. In the present study, the soil loss model, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with GIS has been used to estimate soil loss in the Nethravathi Basin located in the southwestern part of India. The Nethravathi Basin is a tropical coastal humid area having a drainage area of 3128\xc2\xa0km2 up to the gauging station. The parameters of RUSLE model were estimated using remote sensing data and the erosion probability zones were determined using GIS.

The results indicate that the estimated total annual potential soil loss of about 473,339\xc2\xa0t/yr is comparable with the measured sediment of 441,870\xc2\xa0t/yr during the water year 2002\xe2\x80\x932003. The predicted soil erosion rate due to increase in agricultural area is about 14,673.5\xc2\xa0t/yr. The probability zone map has been derived by the weighted overlay index method indicate that the major portion of the study area comes under low probability zone and only a small portion comes under high and very high probability zone. The results can certainly aid in implementation of soil management and conservation practices to reduce the soil erosion in the Nethravathi Basin.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe paper presents the systematic investigations on the activity concentrations of 210Po and 210Pb in the riverine environs of Bharathapuzha, Periyar and Kallada, the three major rivers of coastal Kerala. The radionuclides 210Po and 210Pb in sediment and water samples were separated using radiochemical methods and activity was counted using scintillation based alpha counting system. The mean value of 210Po activity in sediment samples was found to be 3.4\xc2\xa0Bq\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921, 40.0\xc2\xa0Bq\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921 and 22.5\xc2\xa0Bq\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921 in Bharathapuzha, Periyar and Kallada river respectively. The mean value of 210Pb activity was found to be 13.5\xc2\xa0Bq\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921, 88.7\xc2\xa0Bq\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921 and 60.8\xc2\xa0Bq\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921 in the sediment samples of Bharathapuzha, Periyar and Kallada river respectively. The activity ratio 210Po/210Pb shows that the radionuclides 210Po and 210Pb are not in equilibrium in the riverine environs and the accumulation of 210Pb in sediment is greater than that of 210Po. The disequilibrium between 210Po and 210Pb and the higher activity of 210Pb indicates the presence of unsupported 210Pb in the sediments. A significant correlation was observed between the concentrations of these radionuclides and organic matter content and clay minerals of the sediment samples. The low activity of 210Po and 210Pb was observed in the dissolved phase due to the removal of these particle reactive radionuclides from solution to particle. High Kd value for 210Po and 210Pb in water column indicates that there is a strong adsorption of these radionuclides on to the suspended particles in the aquatic environment, where suspended particulate matter acts as a carrier to transport and removal of 210Po and 210Pb from their site of production.'

The fall model in the present study accounts both spring seepage and wave action, resulting in undercutting and this fall affects only the topmost laterite and the just below sandstone in the cliff. Slippage in this area affects all the litho-units and hence the geologic characteristics of all the litho-units are considered for developing the slippage model. This mathematically derived model can be used in other cliffs exhibiting the same morphology as well as the one controlled by the same influencing factors. This model differs from other models in incorporating multi-lithounits as well as multi-notches. Varkala cliffs form a part of the aspiring geopark in the Global Geopark Network and hence a study on the cliff recession is a pressing requirement.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (281KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractMicro-watershed level planning requires a host of interrelated information to be generated and studied in relation to each other. An attempt has been made to assess the resource potential of Nambiar Watershed by the integration of remote sensing and GIS techniques to identify and evaluate the land quality and water resources. Different thematic maps have been prepared with the aid of visual interpretation keys, using IRS P6, LISS IV data and SOI topographical maps and relevant secondary data. Land and water resources are assessed individually integrating information derived from the remote sensing satellite data. By combining both land resources with water resources using the GIS techniques, a composite map on the Resource Potential Zones (RPZ) were created.The integrated resource analysis has proved to be efficient in categorizing the watershed as excellent to poor based on the weightage given and the suitability of the land parcels for a particular land use was assessed. The present study helps in the strategic management of water, agriculture, forest and other natural resources for the sustainable development of the Nambiar watershed that runs across Nanguneri Taluk in Tirunelveli district in TamilNadu state in India.'

Abstract: "AbstractObjectiveThe present work is undertaken for phytochemical and pharmacological investigation of Diplazium esculentum leaf's hydroalcoholic extract (DEHAe).MethodsAntioxidant activity was estimated by DPPH assay and nitric oxide (NO) inhibition was determined using Griess reagent. Diabetes was induced artificially by streptozotocin (STZ). DEHAe was administered orally to see its affect on fasting glucose level, lipid profile, biochemical parameters and antioxidant enzyme activity. Hepatoprotective activity was examined by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced hepatic injury method. Histological slides of pancreas were prepared to observe the histological changes.ResultsThe experiments yielded expected activity of the plant extract in animal model. IC50 value of DEHAe for in\xc2\xa0vitro antioxidant activity and NO inhibition activity was found to be 138.8 and 151.9\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/mL respectively. Fasting blood glucose level was reduced 50.2% by DEHAe (500\xc2\xa0mg/kg) in STZ induced diabetic rats. Significant normalization (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01 and p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) of the lipid profile and serum marker enzymes were observed in the diabetic rats treated with DEHAe. Sufficient normalization of antioxidant enzyme activity was observed by DEHAe administration. CCl4 had a little impact on the liver enzyme activity and total biluribin on the rats pre-treated with DEHAe. Pancreas of DEHAe treated animals showed a significant reduction of necrosis and regeneration of \xce\xb2-cells.ConclusionThe present experiment shows that DEHAe has significant activity on free radical scavenging, antidiabetic, hyperlipidimic and hepatoprotective activity and thus can be consumed as a functional vegetable."

Title: 'Characterization, antibacterial, antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory and antityrosinase activity of green synthesized silver nanoparticles using Calophyllum tomentosum leaves extract'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe current research study is to develop an easy and eco-friendly method for the synthesis of AgNPs using aqueous leaf extract of Calophyllum tomentosum (CtAgNPs) and evaluated the extract to know the effects of anti-bacterial, antioxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory and anti-tyrosinase activity. Using UV\xe2\x80\x93vis spectrophotometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) characterized the Calophyllum tomentosum mediated silver nanoparticles. The leaf extract of C. tomentosum yielded flavonoids, saponins, tannins, alkaloids, glycosides, phenols, terpenoids and coumarins. AgNPs formation was confirmed by UV\xe2\x80\x93vis spectra at 438\xe2\x80\xafnm. Crystalline structure with a face centered cubic (fcc) of AgNPs was observed in XRD. FTIR had shown that the phytochemicals were responsible for the reduction and capping material of silver nanoparticles. The size and shape of the AgNPs were determined using SEM. From EDX study analysed the strong absorption property of AgNPs. The CtAgNPs have showed significant antibacterial activity on multi drug resistance bacteria. The CtAgNPs had shown strong antioxidant (DPPH, H2O2 scavenging, nitric oxide scavenging power, reducing power) activities. The CtAgNPs had strongly inhibited the \xce\xb1-glucosidase and DPPIV compared to \xce\xb1-amylase. The CtAgNPs exhibited strong anti-inflammatory activity (albumin denaturation, membrane stabilization, heat haemolytic, protein inhibitory, lipoxygenase, xanthine oxidase) and tyrosinase inhibitory activity. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt on the synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Calophyllum tomentosum leaves extract. Hence, to validate our results the in vivo studies at molecular level are needed to develop an antioxidant, anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory agent.'

Abstract: 'AbstractRoots of Gmelina arborea (Gambhari) is a medicinally important raw drug traded in India. However, Gmelinaasiatica and Mallotus nudiflorus are also found in the raw drug markets as Gambhari. The current study aims to identify molecular markers based on the nuclear ribosomal DNA \xe2\x80\x93 ITS1 region to distinguish the authentic species from substitute/adulterants. The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) was amplified to identify species-specific markers using universal primers. Based on the sequence of the ITS region, specific primers were designed for G.\xc2\xa0arborea, G.\xc2\xa0asiatica and M.\xc2\xa0nudiflorus which efficiently amplified 142\xc2\xa0bp, 93\xc2\xa0bp and 150\xc2\xa0bp of the ITS1 region of the respective species. The notable feature of this molecular method is that it is technically accurate, practically convenient and suitable for analyzing large numbers of samples. This study demonstrates that the ITS1 region can be used for reliable authentication of medicinal plants and detection of adulterants and substitutes of Gambhari.'

Title: 'RESEARCH ARTICLETraditional Indian religious streets: A spatial study of the streets of Mathura'
Author: 'Meeta'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095263517300596
Abstract: "AbstractStreets determine the spatial characteristics of a city and are its most important element. They retain their unique identity by depicting their own sense of place and provide psychological and functional meaning to people's lives. Traditional streets, located in the heart of a city and where religious buildings are situated, are visited by numerous pilgrims daily and should be assessed for their physical features and spatial qualities. This study aims to investigate the character of one of such streets, Vishram Bazaar Street, which is a commercial street where the famous Dwarkadhish temple of Mathura is located. This study, therefore, aspires to uncover the spatial qualities of the street in terms of its physical characteristics based on the tool given by Reid Ewing, Clemente, and Handy, which includes imageability, enclosure, human scale, transparency, and complexity, and to establish the relevance of these qualities in Indian religious streets. The methods used for data collection are literature reviews, on-site documentation (field notes, photographs, and videos), visual assessment, and questionnaire surveys."

Title: 'Shifting cultivators in South Asia: Expansion, marginalisation and specialisation over the long term'
Author: 'Eleanor'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618211002989
Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper will consider alternative perspectives on the long-term history of shifting cultivation in India and Sri Lanka. Ethnographic and historical accounts of shifting cultivation, often by groups marginal to centres of urbanism and agrarian civilisation, are reviewed. Shifting cultivation persists in hill regions which are more marginal for sedentary, high intensity agriculture and state procurement of taxation. This can be considered as a strategy both to exploit more marginal lands and to avoid state domination. The origins of this historical equilibrium are hypothesized to lie with the expansion of later Neolithic agriculture (4000\xe2\x80\x933000 BP) and the development of hierarchical polities in the Indian plains in the Iron Age (mainly after 3000 BP). The archaeological record of early agriculture indicates that cultivation precedes sedentary villages, suggesting that shifting cultivation may have been a widespread economic system in the Neolithic, in both the Ganges Valley and the Deccan Plateau of South India. These areas are more suited to sedentary cultivation that could support higher population densities. Therefore, as populations grew in the Neolithic the economic system shifted to sedentary agriculture. The expansion of trade networks, hierarchical societies and demographic density pushed shifting cultivation practices into increasingly marginal settings, where this became an interdependent strategy. Specialist hunter\xe2\x80\x93gatherers trading in forest products became an increasingly important aspect of forest exploitation as did cultivation of \xe2\x80\x98cash crop trees\xe2\x80\x99. The potential to detect the effect of some of these processes in archaeological and palynological evidence is explored.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe coastal landuse and land cover features in the South West coast of Kanyakumari are dynamically regulated due to marine and terrestrial processes and often controlling by natural and anthropogenic activities. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the decadal changes and their transformations of landuse and land cover (LULC) features under Level II category of USGS-LULC Classification System using Landsat ETM+ and TM images using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) algorithm for the period 2000\xe2\x80\x932011. The classified LULC features are categorized as beachface land cover, cultivable lands, plantation and shrub vegetation, fallow land, barren land, settlements and built-ups, water bodies, and mining area, etc. The geo-database is prepared for LULC feature class with an attributes of name, location, area and spatial distribution, etc. It shows the larger area in beachface land cover (sandy beaches, foredunes, uplands, Teri dunes (laterite) and associated nearshore landforms), plantations, cultivable lands, fallows, and barren lands are converted into built-ups and it increases more than twice in the period of 10\xc2\xa0years. Using GIS techniques, the analysis of change detection matrix reveals that the total area of 45.90\xc2\xa0km2 in different LULC features periodically shifted or transformed from one state to another one or more states, i.e. the beachface land cover area of 1.24\xc2\xa0km2 is encroached for built-ups and 0.63\xc2\xa0km2 for placer mining during the decade. Meanwhile, the area of 0.21\xc2\xa0km2 in this cover is transformed into wetlands and saltwater bodies. During the past decade, the expansion of area in the built-ups and settlements are directly proportional to the growth of population, which produces severe threat to the coastal resources. Accuracy assessment of classified images shows the overall accuracy is estimated as 81.16% and 77.52% and overall Kappa coeffient statistical values of 0.83 and 0.76 for the year 2000 and 2011 respectively. Ground truth verification of the extracted LULC features performed using 120 samples (10 samples per class) reveals that the accuracy of classified features is 89%. This indicates the acceptable accuracy of the classified LULC features for landuse and land cover change studies. The geodatabase of LULC features is used as primary source for sustainable land resource management in the coastal region.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Lava flows produced by fractional crystallization of parent magma from an enriched mantle source.\xe2\x80\xa2Geochemical signature of plume-derived melts and lithospheric mantle.\xe2\x80\xa2Fault-controlled, in situ eruptions in an intrabasinal tectonic setting.AbstractThe Rajahmundry Trap Basalts (RTB) are erupted through fault-controlled fissures in the Krishna-Godavari Basin (K-G Basin) of Godavari Triple Junction, occurring as a unique outcrop sandwiched between Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments along the east coast of India. Detailed geochemical studies have revealed that RTB are mid-Ti (1.74\xe2\x80\x931.92) to high-Ti (2.04\xe2\x80\x932.81) basalts with a distinct quartz tholeiitic parentage. MgO (6.2\xe2\x80\x9313.12\xc2\xa0wt.%), Mg# (29\xe2\x80\x9350) and Zr (109\xe2\x80\x93202\xc2\xa0ppm) suggest that these basalts evolved by fractional crystallization during the ascent of the parent magma along deep-seated fractures. Moderate to high fractionation of HREE, as indicated by (Gd/Yb)N ratios (1.71\xe2\x80\x932.31) of RTB, suggest their generation through 3\xe2\x80\x935% melting of a Fe-rich mantle corresponding to the stability fields of spinel and garnet peridotite at depths of 60\xe2\x80\x93100\xc2\xa0km. Low K2O/P2O5 (0.26\xe2\x80\x931.26), high TiO2/P2O5 (6.74\xe2\x80\x9316.79), La/Nb (0.89\xe2\x80\x931.45), Nb/Th\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa08 (8.35\xe2\x80\x9313), negative anomalies at Rb reflect minimum contamination by granitic continental crust. (Nb/La)PM ratios (0.66\xe2\x80\x931.1) of RTB are attributed to endogenic contamination resulted through recycling of subducted oceanic slab into the mantle. Pronounced Ba enrichment with relative depletion in Rb indicates assimilation of Infra- and Inter-trappean sediments of estuarine to shallow marine character. Geochemical compositions such as Al2O3/TiO2 (3.88\xe2\x80\x936.83), medium to high TiO2 (1.74\xe2\x80\x932.81\xc2\xa0wt.%), positive Nb anomalies and LREE enrichment of these RTB attest to their mantle plume origin and indicate the generation of parent magma from a plume-related enriched mantle source with EM I signature. Ba/Th (46\xe2\x80\x93247), Ba/La (3.96\xe2\x80\x9328.51) and Th/Nb (0.08\xe2\x80\x930.13) ratios suggest that the source enrichment process was marked by recycling of subduction-processed oceanic crust and lithospheric components into the mantle. Zr/Hf (37\xe2\x80\x9341) and Zr/Ba (0.51\xe2\x80\x933.24) indicate involvement of an asthenospheric mantle source. The Rajahmundry basalts show affinity towards FOZO (focal zone mantle) and PSCL (post-Archaean subcontinental lithosphere) which reflect mixing between asthenospheric and lithospheric mantle components in their source. Origin of RTB magma is attributed to plume-lithosphere interaction and the upward movement of melt is facilitated by intrabasinal deep-seated faults in the K-G Basin.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractCancer is the cause of more than 6 million deaths worldwide every year. For centuries, medicinal plants have been used in the treatment of cancer. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery and acupuncture point stimulation are also used to treat cancer. The present study was intended to reveal the cytotoxic and anticancer potential of selected Cyathea species and to highlight their importance in the pharmaceutical industry for the development of cost-effective drugs. Cytotoxic studies using brine shrimp lethality bioassays and MCF 7\xc2\xa0cell line cultures were carried out. Compared to petroleum ether, chloroform and acetone extracts, the ethanol extracts of selected Cyathea species were found to be more effective against brine shrimps. The ethanol extracts were further subjected to 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell proliferation assays. A decrease in cell viability and an increase in growth inhibition were observed for the MCF 7\xc2\xa0cell line. The maximum percentage of cell inhibition was observed in Cyathea crinit, followed by Cyathea nilgirensis and Cyathea gigantea. The results of the present study suggest that Cyathea species are an effective source of cytotoxic compounds.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2First application of metallogenesis to prove the tectonic affinity of cratons.\xe2\x80\xa2Establish continental assembly for North China Craton and Indian Shield.\xe2\x80\xa2New insight and method to study the tectonic affinity of cratons and the reconstruction of supercontinent.AbstractThe correlation between the North China Craton (NCC) and the Indian Shield (IND) has been a hot topic in recent years. On the basis of ore deposit databases, the NCC and IND have shown broad similarity in metallogenesis from the middle Archaean to the Mesoproterozoic. The two blocks both have three major metallogenic systems: (1) the Archaean BIF metallogenic system; (2) the Paleoproterozoic Cu-Pb-Zn metallogenic system; and (3) the Mesoproterozoic Fe-Pb-Zn system. In the north margin of the NCC and the west margin of the IND, the Archaean BIF-Au-Cu-Pb-Zn deposits had the same petrogenesis and host rocks, the Paleoproterozoic Cu-Pb-Zn deposits were controlled by active belts, and the Mesoproterozoic Fe-Pb-Zn deposits were mainly related to multi-stage rifting. Matching regional mineralization patterns and geological features has established the continental assembly referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cNCWI\xe2\x80\x9d, an acronym for the north margin of the NCC (NC) and the west margin of the IND (WI) during the middle Archaean to the Mesoproterozoic. In this assembly, the available geological and metallogenic data from the Eastern Block and active belts of NC fit those from the Dharwar craton and the Aravalli\xe2\x80\x93Delhi\xe2\x80\x93Vindhyan belt of WI, respectively. Moreover, the depositional model and environment of Paleoproterozoic metasedimentary manganese deposits in NCWI implied that the assembly may be located at low latitudes, where the conditions were favorable for dissolving ice and precipitating manganese deposits.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image'

The median projection shows increases in mean annual runoff of 20\xe2\x80\x9330% in the Indian sub-continent for 2046\xe2\x80\x932075 relative to 1976\xe2\x80\x932005. The change in runoff is driven mainly by the change in precipitation, moderated (in wetter futures) or intensified (in drier futures) by higher temperature and potential evaporation. The paper also investigates the uncertainties of the projection due to scaling methods and selection of GCMs. The difference in runoff projections from different scaling methods is small relative to the large uncertainty in precipitation projections from the GCMs. Sub-selecting only the \xe2\x80\x9cbetter\xe2\x80\x9d performing GCMs shows marginal difference in the uncertainty range of projected runoff. For the broad scale projections presented here, it is best to use projections informed by all the GCMs to provide an indication of the full uncertainty range.'

Abstract: 'SummaryDrought is a naturally occurring periodical event associated with significant decrease of water availability over a region. Drought, being a complex in nature it is difficult to define, quantify and monitor. Drought is mainly classified into meteorological drought, hydrological drought and agricultural drought. Among these classifications, assessment of hydrological drought has more importance in the water resources management perspective. Objective of this study is to analyse multi-time step hydrological drought by Stream flow Drought Index (SDI) and Standardized Runoff Index (SRI). To obtain these indices, 36 years (1972\xe2\x80\x932007) of daily discharge data, measured in Ghataprabha river basin (a sub basin of Krishna river) is considered. Results of both indices indicate moderate drought between 1986\xe2\x80\x931988 and 2001\xe2\x80\x932005 continuously. While comparing both indices, there is a good correlation between 9-month SRI and SDI is observed and it increases for 12-month SRI and SDI. This study may help to choose the appropriate drought indices among SRI and SDI for different lengths of drought studies.'

The advantage of using the aeromagnetic data is that the data set has uniform coverage and is independent of the accessibility of the region. In the present study, available reconnaissance scale aeromagnetic data over Peninsular India are analyzed to understand the magnetic signatures of the Precambrian shield and suture zones thereby throwing light on the tectonics of the region. Utilizing a combination of differential reduction to pole map, analytic signal, vertical and tilt derivative and upward continuation maps we are able to identify magnetic source distribution, tectonic elements, terrane boundaries, suture zones and metamorphic history of the region. The magnetic sources in the region are mainly related to charnockites, iron ore and alkaline intrusives. Our analysis suggests that the Chitradurga boundary shear and Sileru shear are terrane boundaries while we interpret the signatures of Palghat Cauvery and Achankovil shears to represent suture zones. Processes like metamorphism leave their signatures on the magnetic data: prograde granulites (charnockites) and retrograde eclogites are known to have high susceptibility. We find that charnockites intruded by alkali plutons have higher magnetization compared to the retrogressed charnockites. We interpret that the Dharwar craton to the north of isograd representing greenschist to amphibolite facies transition, has been subjected to metamorphism under low geothermal conditions. Some recent studies suggest a plate tectonic model of subduction\xe2\x80\x93collision\xe2\x80\x93accretion tectonics around the Palghat Cauvery shear zone (PCSZ). Our analysis is able to identify several west to east trending high amplitude magnetic anomalies with deep sources in the region from Palghat Cauvery shear to Achankovil shear. The magnetic high associated with PCSZ may represent the extruded high pressure\xe2\x80\x93ultra high temperature metamorphic belt (granulites at shallow levels and retrogressed eclogites at deeper levels) formed as a result of subduction process.

Abstract: 'AbstractObjectiveTo evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of methyl ferulate (MF) isolated from the roots of Stemona tuberosa (S. tuberosa) Lour (Stemonaceae) in lipopolysaccharide activated macrophage cells.MethodsMethanol extracts of a root powder of S. tuberosa were prepared for isolation of a potential anti-inflammatory agent using ultrasound extraction combined with repeated chromatography on silica gel. After the quantitative analyses, anti-inflammatory activity of the isolated compound was evaluated by measurement of cytokine release, NO generation, expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and phosphorylation of mitogen activated protein kinases including p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase using quantitative kits and Western blotting with specific antibodies.ResultsThe isolation process yielded a potential anti-inflammatory compound with a purity level of 99% determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The compound was identified as MF by using nuclear magnetic resonance. MF strongly inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from macrophages, including IL-6, TNF\xce\xb1, IFN\xce\xb3, yet it did not affect the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase were clearly reduced in MF-treated macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. cyclooxygenase-2 expression and NO generation by macrophages were also suppressed when the cells were treated with MF.ConclusionsThe data suggested that MF is a possible inhibitor of the mitogen activated phosphor kinase pathway and could be a potential anti-inflammatory agent isolated for the first time in medicinal plant S. tuberosa.'

Abstract: "AbstractThe present investigation was designed to study the effect of an active compound isolated from Justicia wynaadensis against multi drug resistant organisms (MDRO's) associated with diabetic patients. The drug resistant pathogens implicated in wound and urinary tract infection of diabetic patients were isolated and identified by molecular sequencing. Solvent\xe2\x80\x93solvent fractionation of crude methanol extract produced hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol\xe2\x80\x93water fraction, among which chloroform fraction was found to be potent when compared with other three fractions. Further, chloroform fraction was subjected to preparatory HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography), that produced four sub-fractions; chloroform HPLC fraction 1 (CHF1) through CHF4. Among the sub-fractions, CHF1 inhibited the pathogens effectively in comparison to other three sub-fractions. The purity of CHF1 was found to be >95%. Therefore, CHF1 was further characterized by NMR and FTIR analysis and based on the structure elucidated, the compound was found to be 3,3\xe2\x80\xb2,4\xe2\x80\xb2-Trihydroxyflavone. The effective dose of this bioactive compound ranged from 32\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/mL to 1.2\xc2\xa0mg/mL. Thus, the present study shows that 3,3\xe2\x80\xb2,4\xe2\x80\xb2-Trihydroxyflavone isolated from J. wynaadensis is an interesting biopharmaceutical agent and could be considered as a source of antimicrobial agent for the treatment of various infections and used as a template molecule for future drug development."

Here we demonstrate the role of extrinsic processes consequent to intrinsic processes as a catalyst for anomalous rapid plate movement. The rapid and accelerated flight of the Indian subcontinent since Deccan volcanism until its collision with Eurasia remains as one of the geological conundrums. Data on seismic tomography, peninsular geomorphology and inferences on continuum of subcrustal structures are utilized to address this enigma. We propose geomorphic isostasy as the mechanism that has driven this fastest drift ever recorded in geological history. It was initiated by sudden instability after the Deccan volcanism and resultant extensive accumulation of lava pile over continental lithosphere of northern India, northern-eastern tilt due to crustal thickness heterogeneity and subcrustal thermal stratification. The drift was sustained by Carlsberg and Central Indian ridge-push until collision and sediment top loading at northeast thenceforth. These inferences and geomorphic isostasy as a catalytic mechanism necessitate variability of drift rates as integral inputs for any continental scale modeling.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (695KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe present study was designed to investigate the free radical defence and antihyperglycemic property of S. mundagam. Petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, methanol and hot water extracts of bark were determined for the total phenolic, tannin, flavonoid content and antioxidant property using DPPH, ABTS+, phosphomolybdenum, FRAP, superoxide, nitric oxide and metal chelating assays. The antioxidant response was best observed in ABTS+ (109686.87\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM TE/g extract), phosphomolybdenum (268.54\xc2\xa0g AAE/100\xc2\xa0g extract) and superoxide radical scavenging assays (84.30%). Bark methanol extract was found highly efficient in scavenging the free radicals than other extracts. The higher phenolic content (54.44\xc2\xa0g GAE/100 extract) could be attributed to this effect. The glucose homeostasis was observed till 180th min in glucose loaded rats treated with the bark methanol extract. The extract could also induce potent hypoglycaemia in STZ induced diabetic rats. The antioxidant defence system could be one of the prime mechanisms of S. mundagam leaf and bark extracts that needs to be studied further for the exact molecular action leading to antidiabetic effect.'

Title: 'Original ArticleRAPD markers for screening shoot gall maker (Betousa stylophora Swinhoe) tolerant genotypes of amla (Phyllanthus emblica L.)'
Author: 'Sethuraman'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1687157X17300616
Abstract: 'AbstractPhyllanthus emblica Linn. is the most important medicinally useful tree crop in Asian Subcontinent and is severely infested by Betousa stylophora Swinhoe, known as shoot gall maker (SGM). This pest tunnels the shoots of seedlings and actively growing branches of trees and develops gall, leading to stunted growth, unusual branching and death of actively growing shoots. Our study revealed that trees possessing smooth bark were free from the attack of this pest than those with rough bark surface. Unfortunately, this character is not detectable either at seedling stage or during early growth of trees in the orchard. RAPD genetic fingerprinting of trees possessing smooth and rough bark revealed distinguishable and highly reproducible DNA banding pattern between the two genotypes. Of the 20 RAPD primers tested, five of them produced distinguishable RAPD bands between rough and smooth barked genotypes of P. emblica. Trees with smooth bark produced five unique RAPD bands with molecular weight ranging from 350\xc2\xa0bp to 1500\xc2\xa0bp and those with rough bark produced six RAPD bands (350\xc2\xa0bp\xe2\x80\x93650\xc2\xa0bp) to utilize these DNA bands as potential DNA marker for screening tolerant genotypes of this crop against SGM. The utility of this finding in genetic improvement of this tree crop against SGM is discussed.'

Abstract: 'AbstractInvasive species are capable of causing considerable damage to natural ecosystems, agriculture and economies throughout the World. Samsum ant, Brachyponera (Pachycondyla) sennaarensis has been a reason for medical implication and social nuisance through its poisonous and severely painful sting causing anaphylactic shock in many cases. We surveyed for the presence of the samsum ant in various provinces of Saudi Arabia. B. sennaarensis was the abundant Ponerinae species in human settlements. In the Eastern provinces, however, few samples were collected, and none were found in the Northern and Western provinces. Infestations of B. sennaarensis were particularly severe in the spring and summer seasons, when the ants make nests in moist areas and in cracks in cemented structures, whereas the extent of infestation reduced in winter seasons.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIn an era of human activities, global environmental changes, habitat loss and species extinction, conservation strategies are a crucial step toward minimizing biodiversity loss. For instance, oceans acidification and land use are intensifying in many places with negative and often irreversible consequences for biodiversity. Biodiversity hotspots, despite some criticism, have become a tool for setting conservation priorities and play an important role in decision-making for cost-effective strategies to preserve biodiversity in terrestrial and, to some extent, marine ecosystems. This area-based approach can be applied to any geographical scale and it is considered to be one of the best approaches for maintaining a large proportion of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biological diversity. However, delineating hotspots includes quantitative criteria along with subjective considerations and the risk is to neglect areas, such as coldspots, with other types of conservation value. Nowadays, it is widely acknowledged that biodiversity is much more than just the number of species in a region and a conservation strategy cannot be based merely on the number of taxa present in an ecosystem. Therefore, the idea that strongly emerges is the need to reconsider conservation priorities and to go toward an interdisciplinary approach through the creation of science-policy partnerships.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe tree rhododendrons include the most widely distributed Himalayan Rhododendron species belonging to the subsection Arborea. Distributions of two members of this sub-species were modelled using bioclimatic data for current conditions (1950\xe2\x80\x932000). A subset of the least correlated bioclimatic variables was used for ecological niche modelling (ENM). We used an ENM ensemble method in the BiodiversityR R-package to map the suitable climatic space for tree rhododendrons based on 217 point location records. Ensemble bioclimatic models for tree rhododendrons had high predictive power with bioclimatic variables, which also separated the climatic spaces for the two species. Tree rhododendrons were found occurring in a wide range of climate and the distributional limits were associated with isothermality, temperature ranges, temperature of the wettest quarter, and precipitation of the warmest quarter of the year. The most suitable climatic space for tree rhododendrons was predicted to be in western Yunnan, China, with suitability declining towards the west and east. Its occurrence in a wide range of climatic settings with highly dissected habitats speaks to the adaptive capacity of the species, which might open up future options for their conservation planning in regions where they are listed as threatened.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Deep water sediments contain high proportion of magnetic minerals.\xe2\x80\xa2Magnetic minerals in the SSD and SP size range.\xe2\x80\xa2Magnetic properties significantly correlated with Al, indicating terrigenous source.\xe2\x80\xa2OMZ characterized by high OC content.\xe2\x80\xa2CaCO3 values high in shallow sediments when compared with deep-sea sediments.AbstractThe spatial distribution patterns of surficial sediment samples from different sedimentary domains (shallow to deep-sea regions) of the eastern Arabian Sea were studied using sediment proxies viz. environmental magnetism, geochemistry, particle size and clay mineralogy. Higher concentrations of magnetic minerals (high \xcf\x87lf) were recorded in the deep-water sediments when compared with the shallow water sediments. The magnetic mineralogy of one of the shallow water samples is influenced by the presence of bacterial magnetite as evidenced from the \xcf\x87ARM/\xcf\x87lfvs. \xcf\x87ARM/\xcf\x87fd biplot. However, the other samples are catchment-derived. The high correlation documented for \xcf\x87lf, anhysteretic remanent magnetisation (\xcf\x87ARM) and isothermal remanent magnetisation (IRM) with Al indicates that the deep-sea surficial sediments are influenced by terrigenous fluxes which have been probably derived from the southern Indian rivers, the Sindhu (the Indus) and the Narmada-Tapti rivers. A lower Mn concentration is recorded in the upper slope sediments from the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) but a higher Mn/Al ratio is documented in the lower slope and deep-sea sediments. Clay minerals such as illite (24\xe2\x80\x9348.5%), chlorite (14.1\xe2\x80\x9334.9%), smectite (10.6\xe2\x80\x9328.7%) and kaolinite (11.9\xe2\x80\x9327.5%) dominate the sediments of shallow and deep-sea regions and may have been derived from different sources and transported by fluvial and aeolian agents. Organic carbon (OC) data indicate a low concentration in the shallow/shelf region (well oxygenated water conditions) and deeper basins (increased bottom-water oxygen concentration and low sedimentation rate). High OC concentrations were documented in the OMZ (very low bottom-water oxygen concentration with high sedimentation rate). The calcium carbonate concentration of the surface sediments from the continental shelf and slope regions (<1800\xc2\xa0m) up to the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge show higher concentrations (average\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa058%) when compared to deep basin sediments (average\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa044%). Our study demonstrates that particle size as well as magnetic grain size, magnetic minerals and elemental variations are good indicators to distinguish terrigenous from biogenic sediments and to identify sediment provenance.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (552KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractKochi is a rapidly growing commercial, industrial and trading centre of Kerala. Due to the tremendous growth and urbanization, the density of population in city is increasing every year. These factors have resulted in land use stresses, reducing open areas especially wetlands [1] in Kochi city for the past decades through land reclamation and encroachments. Again, anthropogenic activities like industrialisation, improper management of sewage and other solid waste lead to degradation of these ecosystems. This study discusses about the unique status of wetlands of Kadamakudypanchayat of Kochi with its Pokkali fields [2], fish farms. It also tries to propose guidelines, strategies and action plan at site specific level for development, conserving its wetlands along with its wise use in an ecological perspective keeping in mind the rapid urbanisation.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis study has been carried out by the integration of seismic interpretations and the well-logging analysis of ten wells distributed in J-field of concession NC-186, Murzuq basin, Libya. Twenty (3D) seismic lines and ten wells have been analyzed. The results of this study indicated that, the main reservoir in this concession is Hawaz Formation. Hawaz has been split into 8 units with a subdivision of Hawaz H4 into three subunits with the objective of better characterization of the three general fine upward intervals. The lower interval of H4 zone presents the better reservoir properties. The depth of reflector H4 ranges from 4100\xc2\xa0ft in the northwestern part of the study area and increases to 4600\xc2\xa0ft in the southeastern part of the study area. In this study, the outline of the Hawaz paleohighs which is NC-186 Field \xe2\x80\x9cJ\xe2\x80\x9d is generally trending in the NW-SE direction. The well logging analysis particularly quick look interpretation indicates that Hawaz Formation in the studied wells is mainly oil-bearing with some water-bearing sand levels at the horizons from H4 to and H6 which are potentially the main reservoirs. The water bearing zones are beyond these horizons starting from the sub-horizon H6c and the oil water contact is probably at depth 4495\xc2\xa0ft. The crossplot of porosity-saturation for H5 and H6b indicates firmly that these horizons are indeed at irreducible state and will produce mainly oil as indicated in J4-NC186 well, while the crossplot of H8 shows wide scattering of points which is the main characteristic for water producing horizon. The depth of Hawaz Formation H4 is more than 4160\xc2\xa0ft in J4, J12 and J16 wells in the northwestern parts of this field and increases to 4400 in the central part of the concession at well J1.'

Title: 'Review ArticleNew candidates for treatment and management of carpal tunnel syndrome based on the Persian Canon of Medicine'
Author: 'Mohammad'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213422017302196
Abstract: "AbstractCarpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is defined as a compressing median mononeuropathy. CTS is one of the major costly debilitating diseases of the hand. Although CTS is a relatively recent concept in current medicine, some evidences show that medieval physicians in Persian medicine (PM) such as Avicenna were familiar with it. The PM textbook written by Avicenna, the Canon of Medicine, defines the anatomy of carpal tunnel and median nerve, as well as mononeuropathy; it also offers suggestions for the prevention and treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (called as Vaja al-asab and Khadar) in the chapter of nerve diseases. The book describes not only symptoms including pain, paresthesia, hypoesthesia, tingling, and numbness, but also its etiology such as nerve compression (entrapment neuropathy); nonphysical reasons such as disturbed balance among the four body humors; alteration in the nerve's temperament (Mizaj) that prevents the transmission of nerve impulses; and the others such as nutrition, mental condition, sleep, weather condition, body movements, and proper disposal of body waste. Furthermore, the book suggests a lifestyle modification method based on six factors and 10 prescriptions composed with 85 natural products that are not actively used for CTS treatment in modern times. The medicinal suggestions for CTS in the Canon of Medicine will be good candidates for discovering new treatments besides providing historical significance to the various insights considered 1000 years ago."

Six flows have been identified on the basis of morphological features and systematic three-tier arrangement of vesicular-entablature-colonnade zones. Petrographically, the studied flows are porphyritic basalts with plagioclase and clinopyroxene representing dominant phenocrystal phases. Major and trace element characteristics reflect moderate magmatic differentiation and fractional crystallization of tholeiitic magmas. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns corroborate pronounced LREE/HREE fractionation with LREE enrichment over MREE and HREE. Primitive mantle normalized trace element abundances are marked by LILE-LREE enrichment with relative HFSE depletion collectively conforming to intraplate magmatism with contributions from sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) and extensive melt-crust interaction. PGE compositions of Vempalle lavas attest to early sulphur-saturated nature of magmas with pronounced sulphide fractionation, while PPGE enrichment over IPGE and higher Pd/Ir ratios accord to the role of a metasomatized lithospheric mantle in the genesis of the lava flows. HFSE-REE-PGE systematics invoke heterogeneous mantle sources comprising depleted asthenospheric MORB type components combined with plume type melts. HFSE-REE variations account for polybaric melting at variable depths ranging from garnet to spinel lherzolite compositional domains of mantle. Intraplate tectonic setting for the Vempalle flows with P-MORB affinity is further substantiated by (i) their origin from a rising mantle plume trapping depleted asthenospheric MORB mantle during ascent, (ii) interaction between plume-derived melts and SCLM, (iii) their rift-controlled intrabasinal emplacement through Archean\xe2\x80\x93Proterozoic cratonic blocks in a subduction-unrelated ocean-continent transition zone (OCTZ). The present study is significant in light of the evolution of Cuddapah basin in the global tectonic framework in terms of its association with Antarctica, plume incubation, lithospheric melting and thinning, asthenospheric infiltration collectively affecting the rifted margin of eastern Dharwar Craton and serving as precursors to supercontinent disintegration.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (460KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractPrecipitation over India is driven by the Indian monsoon. Although changes in this atmospheric circulation are caused by the differential seasonal diabatic heating of Asia and the Indo-Pacific Ocean, it is so far unknown how global warming influences the monsoon rainfalls regionally. Herein, we present a Miocene pollen flora as the first direct proxy for monsoon over southern India during the Middle Miocene Climate Optimum. To identify climatic key parameters, such as mean annual temperature, warmest month temperature, coldest month temperature, mean annual precipitation, mean precipitation during the driest month, mean precipitation during the wettest month and mean precipitation during the warmest month the Coexistence Approach is applied. Irrespective of a ~\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x934\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C higher global temperature during the Middle Miocene Climate Optimum, the results indicate a modern-like monsoonal precipitation pattern contrasting marine proxies which point to a strong decline of Indian monsoon in the Himalaya at this time. Therefore, the strength of monsoon rainfall in tropical India appears neither to be related to global warming nor to be linked with the atmospheric conditions over the Tibetan Plateau. For the future it implies that increased global warming does not necessarily entail changes in the South Indian monsoon rainfall.Graphical abstractDownload full-size imageHighlights\xe2\x96\xba A Miocene pollen flora is the first direct proxy for monsoon over S-India during the MMCO. \xe2\x96\xba The Coexistence Approach provides detailed palaeoseasonality information. \xe2\x96\xba The results demonstrate decoupling of the monsoon between N and S India during the MMCO.'

Despite an established long-term surface warming trend for the whole northern hemisphere, sea surface temperatures (SST) in the East Pacific have remained relatively constant for the period of 2001\xe2\x80\x932010. Our analysis reveals that SST anomaly probability density function of the leading two Isomap components is bimodal. We conclude that Isomap shows the existence of two distinct regimes in surface ocean temperature, resembling the break and active phases of rainfall over equatorial land areas. These regimes occurred within two separated time windows during the past three decades. Strengthening of trade winds over Pacific was coincident with the cold phase of east equatorial Pacific. This pattern was reversed during the warm phase of east equatorial Pacific. The El Ni\xc3\xb1o event of 1997/1998 happened within the transition mode between these two regimes and may be a trigger for the SST changes in the Pacific.

Abstract: 'AbstractObjectiveTo screen the antimicrobial potential of three ethnomedicinal plants Chassalia curviflora Thw. (C. curviflora), Cyclea peltata Hook. F. & Thomson (C. peltata) and Euphorbia hirta L (E. hirta) used in folk medicines in Aarukani hills Kani tribe, Tamil Nadu, India against human bacterial pathogens.MethodsAntibacterial efficacy was performed by disc diffusion method against the pathogens viz., Escherichia coli (E. coli) (ATCC 35218), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (ATCC 6538), Salmonella typhi (S. typhi) (MTCC 733), Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) and Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) and incubated for 24 h at 37 \xc2\xb0C.ResultsThe maximum degree of antibacterial activity was observed in C. peltata followed by C. curviflora. While E. hirta showed comparatively low degree of antibacterial activity. The methanolic extract of C. peltata showed the antibacterial activity against three pathogens viz., S. pyogenes, P. vulgaris and E. coli with the inhibition zones 12 mm, 10 mm and 9 mm, respectively. hexane extracts of C. peltata also showed the antibacterial activity against two selected pathogens viz., P. vulgaris and P. mirabilis with 15 mm and 12 mm of inhibition zones. All the three different concentrations (0.25, 0.50 & 0.75 mg/mL) of methanolic extract of C. peltata show the inhibitory effect on the three susceptible bacteria S. pyogenes, P. vulgaris and E. coli with the maximum inhibition in the highest concentration (0.75 mg/mL). The methanolic and hexane extracts of C. curviflora exhibited the antibacterial activity against only one bacterium each i.e. P. vulgaris and S. typhi with the maximum zone of inhibition 13 and 11 mm respectively. The methanolic and hexane extracts of E. hirta exhibited the antibacterial activity against only one bacterium i.e. S. pyogenes with the maximum zone of inhibition 13 and 11 mm respectively.ConclusionsThe present investigation revealed that the C. curviflora, C. peltata and E. hirta are potentially good source of antibacterial agents and demonstrates the importance of such plants in traditional medicines.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper follows the discipline of Urban Design to elaborate the concepts of disaster resilience at the neighbourhood level for the collective development of Chennai city. The increased inflow and use of resources attributed to the growing urban population creates a pressure on the various natural systems, increasing their vulnerability to multiple attacks from natural and man-made forces. Hence the future adaptability of cities is important for its growth in the aftermath of a disaster strike. The intent of this research is thus to develop a framework of strategies for an emergency response programme and to develop a design scheme to make cities resilient, through neighbourhood development. A sample precinct of Chepauk was taken up for the design demonstration after a detailed analysis of the same, addressing various physical factors such as land use, open spaces, connectivity networks, physical and social infrastructure, built density, ecology and emergency response mechanism.'

Title: 'Environmental MicrobiologyOutstanding impact of soil tillage on the abundance of soil hydrolases revealed by a metagenomic approach'
Author: 'Renata Carolini'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1517838218300029
Abstract: 'AbstractThe soil represents the main source of novel biocatalysts and biomolecules of industrial relevance. We searched for hydrolases in silico in four shotgun metagenomes (4,079,223 sequences) obtained in a 13-year field trial carried out in southern Brazil, under the no-tillage (NT), or conventional tillage (CT) managements, with crop succession (CS, soybean/wheat), or crop rotation (CR, soybean/maize/wheat/lupine/oat). We identified 42,631 hydrolases belonging to five classes by comparing with the KEGG database, and 44,928 sequences by comparing with the NCBI-NR database. The abundance followed the order: lipases\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0laccases\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0cellulases\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0proteases\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0amylases\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0pectinases. Statistically significant differences were attributed to the tillage system, with the NT showing about five times more hydrolases than the CT system. The outstanding differences can be attributed to the management of crop residues, left on the soil surface in the NT, and mechanically broken and incorporated into the soil in the CT. Differences between the CS and the CR were slighter, 10% higher for the CS, but not statistically different. Most of the sequences belonged to fungi (Verticillium, and Colletotrichum for lipases and laccases, and Aspergillus for proteases), and to the archaea Sulfolobus acidocaldarius for amylases. Our results indicate that agricultural soils under conservative managements may represent a hotspot for bioprospection of hydrolases.'

The compounds were screened for inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3\xce\xb2 (GSK-3\xce\xb2) protein, a wound-healing biomarker, by molecular docking and dynamic studies. Taraxerol may be a potent inhibitor of GSK-3\xce\xb2 because it exhibited minimum binding (\xe2\x88\x9212.59\xc2\xa0kJ\xc2\xa0mol\xe2\x88\x921) and docking (\xe2\x88\x9211.25\xc2\xa0kJ\xc2\xa0mol\xe2\x88\x921) energy. Molecular dynamics studies revealed that taraxerol had minimum potential energy with the target protein. Wound-healing was studied in experimental rats in vivo. Taraxerol was efficient, with a mean time of epithelialization of 18.28\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.17 days in the excision wound model. In the incision wound model, it had significant activity, with a skin-breaking strength of 562.36\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa07.60.

Abstract: 'AbstractThe present study focuses on the simulation of daily rainfall series based on atmospheric predictors and historical data using a bivariate Generalized Linear Model. Temperature and precipitation data along with a set of covariates were made use of in generating the simulations. Probability of occurrence of rainfall was predicted using logistic regression models. The amount of rainfall on a rainy day was modelled using a gamma distribution. The covariates in the model comprise of different categories such as site effects for spatial variation, year effects allowing long term trends, month effects for seasonality, day effects with temporal auto correlation and atmospheric predictors. Rainfall series were generated for both future and past periods at multi sites simultaneously using atmospheric predictors. The model developed was applied in a typical catchment in the state of Kerala in India. The model simulations were acceptable on the basis of the performance evaluated using statistical analysis. The model can be used as a weather generator to simulate the daily rainfall series for both past and future periods.'

Abstract: 'AbstractLand surface temperature (LST) is an important variable in climate, hydrologic, ecological, biophysical and biochemical studies (Mildrexler et al., 2011). The most effective way to obtain LST measurements is through satellites. Presently, LST from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor is applied in various fields due to its high spatial and temporal availability over the globe, but quite difficult to provide observations in cloudy conditions. This study evolves of prediction of LST under clear and cloudy conditions using microwave vegetation indices (MVIs), elevation, latitude, longitude and Julian day as inputs employing an artificial neural network (ANN) model. MVIs can be obtained even under cloudy condition, since microwave radiation has an ability to penetrate through clouds. In this study LST and MVIs data of the year 2010 for the Cauvery basin on a daily basis were obtained from MODIS and advanced microwave scanning radiometer (AMSR-E) sensors of aqua satellite respectively. Separate ANN models were trained and tested for the grid cells for which both LST and MVI were available. The performance of the models was evaluated based on standard evaluation measures. The best performing model was used to predict LST where MVIs were available. Results revealed that predictions of LST using ANN are in good agreement with the observed values. The ANN approach presented in this study promises to be useful for predicting LST using satellite observations even in cloudy conditions.'

Magmatism and granulite facies metamorphism of this age has not previously been recognised in the Gawler Craton. The magmatic rocks have steep LREE-enriched patterns and high Ga/Al values, suggesting they are A-type granites. Calculated metamorphic forward models suggest that this event was associated with high apparent thermal gradients and reached pressures of 3.2\xe2\x80\x935.4 kbar and temperatures of 775\xe2\x80\x93815 \xc2\xb0C. The high apparent thermal gradients may reflect pluton-enhanced metamorphism, consistent with the presence of A-type granites. The recognition of ca. 1.45 Ga tectonism in the northern Gawler Craton is added to a compilation of ca. 1.50\xe2\x80\x931.40 Ga magmatism, shear zone reactivation, rift basin development and isotope resetting throughout the South and North Australian Cratons that shows that this event was widespread in eastern Proterozoic Australia. This event is stylistically similar to ca. 1.45 Ga A-type magmatism and high thermal gradient metamorphism in Laurentia in this interval and provides further support for a connection between Australia and Laurentia during the Mesoproterozoic. The tectonic setting of the 1.50\xe2\x80\x931.40 Ga event is unclear but may record rifting within the Nuna (or Columbia) supercontinent, or a period of intracontinental extension within a long-lived convergent setting.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (339KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Article16S rDNA-Based Phylogeny of Non-Symbiotic Bacteria of Entomopathogenic Nematodes from Infected Insect Cadavers'
Author: 'M.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1672022911600132
Abstract: 'AbstractUsing 16S rDNA gene sequencing technique, three different species of non-symbiotic bacteria of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) (Steinernema sp. and Heterorhabditis sp.) were isolated and identified from infected insect cadavers (Galleria mellonella larvae) after 48-hour post infections. Sequence similarity analysis revealed that the strains SRK3, SRK4 and SRK5 belong to Ochrobactrum cytisi, Schineria larvae and Ochrobactrum anthropi, respectively. The isolates O. anthropi and S. larvae were found to be associated with Heterorhabditis indica strains BDU-17 and Yer-136, respectively, whereas O. cytisi was associated with Steinernema siamkayai strain BDU-87. Phenotypically, temporal EPN bacteria were fairly related to symbiotic EPN bacteria (Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus genera). The strains SRK3 and SRK5 were phylogeographically similar to several non-symbionts and contaminated EPN bacteria isolated in Germany (LMG3311T) and China (X-14), while the strain SRK4 was identical to the isolates of S. larvae (L1/57, L1/58, L1/68 and L2/11) from Wohlfahrtia magnifica in Hungary. The result was further confirmed by RNA secondary structure and minimum energy calculations of aligned sequences. This study suggested that the non-symbionts of these nematodes are phylogeographically diverged in some extent due to phase variation. Therefore, these strains are not host-dependent, but environment-specific isolates.'

However, higher dose of the extract subsequently reduced gastric ulcer induced aberrations by pylorus ligation (70.05%) and ethanol (78.16%) as judged by their altered biochemical parameters such as free acidity, total acidity, total carbohydrate, total protein and pepsin activity. Furthermore, macroscopic examination of rat\xe2\x80\x99s stomach also showed that the pretreatment with methanolic extract notably lowered the pylorus ligation and ethanol induced ulcers.

Abstract: 'AbstractSaraca asoca (Fabaceae) is a prime ingredient in Asokarishta, a well-known Ayurvedic preparation for gynecological ailments. Due to scarcity, adulteration or substitution of related raw drugs is a common practice in its preparation. The bark of Kingiodendron pinnatum (Roxb. ex DC.) Harms, morphologically similar to S.\xc2\xa0asoca (Asoka) is a widely used substitute. The present study aimed to evaluate the pharmacological effectiveness of K.\xc2\xa0pinnatum as an alternative for S.\xc2\xa0asoca in Asokarishta by determining the inhibitory effect of estrogen induced uterus endometrial thickening in immature female rats. Arishta was prepared using S.\xc2\xa0asoca and with the substitute, K.\xc2\xa0pinnatum as per Ayurvedic Pharmacopeia. Uterus endometrial thickening was induced by the administration of estradiol (20\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/kg b. wt, i.p) to 8-day-old rats for 5 alternate days. On day 16, following estradiol administration, the serum estrogen level was found elevated to 156.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa08\xc2\xa0pg/ml from the normal value 32.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0pg/ml and consequently increased the thickness of uterus endometrium from 16.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.4 to 75.2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa015.3\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm.

Abstract: 'AbstractThe present investigation involves the distribution of 210Po in the soils of Virajpet taluk, in Coorg District. The soil samples were collected along a vertical profile at various locations. The samples were analyzed for determination of 210Po activity using standard radiochemical analytical method. The distribution of 210Po along vertical profile was found. The dependence of 210Po activity on organic matter and clay in a vertical profile were analysed. The texture of soil shows that soil is sandy loam or loamy sand, in which illuviation takes place easily. The 210Po activity varies from 1.59\xc2\xa0Bqkg\xe2\x88\x921 to 13.95\xc2\xa0Bqkg\xe2\x88\x921 in first layer, 0.49\xc2\xa0Bqkg\xe2\x88\x921 to 9.79\xc2\xa0Bqkg\xe2\x88\x921 in second layer and 0.58\xc2\xa0Bqkg\xe2\x88\x921 to 6.14\xc2\xa0Bqkg\xe2\x88\x921 in third layer.

The plant is a necessary component of many Ayurvedic drug preparations since historical times. It is widely used as a crucial ancient drug for kidney and bladder stones.ObjectivesThe main objective of the study was to evaluate the acute toxicity and anti inflammatory efficacy of methanolic extract of R.aquatica Lour. in in\xc2\xa0vivo models.Materials and methodsThe qualitative phytochemical analysis and invitro antioxidant activity of the roots of methanolic extract of R.aquatica Lour. (MERA) was evaluated. The acute toxicity effect of MERA was evaluated with two different doses (550, 2000\xc2\xa0mg/kg body weight), were administrated orally to Wistar rats. The rats were observed for sign and symptoms of toxicity and mortality for 14 days. The parameters measured including relative organ weight, blood, biochemical and histopathological parameters of hepatic and renal toxicity. The anti-inflammatory effect of MERA was also evaluated in carrageenan and dextran-induced paw edema models.ResultsThe phytochemical evaluation of MERA shows the presence of secondary metabolites like alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics and tannins, phytosterols, reducing sugars, proteins and terpenoids. The results of in-vitro antioxidant evaluation of MERA reveal its capability to scavenging free radical at a lower concentration. The MERA did not show any visible signs of toxicity up to the dose of 2000\xc2\xa0mg/kg body weight. The results obtained from our carrageenan and dextran-induced paw edema model study also proved the anti-inflammatory effect of MERA in rat model.ConclusionThe result shows the potential of MERA as an anti-inflammatory drug to reduce the signs of inflammation devoid of any toxic effect.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (328KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: "AbstractThe main objective of this study is to classify the entire State of Kerala into optimum number of homogeneous zones based on monthly rainfall. The same is done by Ward's Clustering method by taking the monthly rainfall data for five consecutive years from 2008-2012 of 63 raingauge stations in Kerala state. Clustering is the process of dividing the area under consideration to a limited number of climatologically homogeneous zones, based on any hydrologic parameter. The purpose of cluster analysis is to place objects into groups suggested by the data, so that objects in a given cluster tend to be similar to each other and objects in different clusters tend to be dissimilar. It is found that the region can be grouped into seven clusters. There exists large variability in average annual rainfall of different clusters. There are cluster groups where the annual rainfall is as high as 1.5 times and as less as half of average annual rainfall of Kerala as a whole."

On the basis of groundmass mineral chemistry (phlogopite, spinel, perovskite and clinopyroxene), bulk-rock chemistry (SiO2, K2O, low TiO2, Ba/Nb and La/Sm), and perovskite Nd isotopic compositions, the TK-1 (macrocrystic variety) and TK-4 (Macrocrystic variety) kimberlites in this cluster are here classified as orangeites (i.e. Group II kimberlites), with geochemical characteristics that are very similar to orangeites previously described from the Bastar Craton in central India, as well as the Kaapvaal Craton in South Africa. The remaining kimberlites (e.g., TK-2, TK-3 and the TK-1 microcrystic variant), are more similar to other 1100 Ma, Group I-type kimberlites of the Eastern Dharwar Craton, as well as the typical Group I kimberlites of the Kaapvaal Craton. Through the application of geochemical modelling, based on published carbonated peridotite/melt trace element partition coefficients, we show that the generation of the TKC kimberlites and the orangeites results from low degrees of partial melting of a metasomatised, carbonated peridotite.Depleted mantle (TDM) Nd perovskite model ages of the 1100 Ma Timmasamudram kimberlites show that the metasomatic enrichment of their source regions are broadly similar to that of the Mesoproterozoic kimberlites of the EDC. The younger, late Cretaceous (ca. 90\xc2\xa0Ma) TK-1 (macrocrystic variant) and TK-4 kimberlites, as well as the orangeites from the Bastar Craton, share similar Nd model ages of 1100\xc2\xa0Ma, consistent with a similarity in the timing of source enrichment during the amalgamation of Rodinia supercontinent. The presence of late Cretaceous diamondiferous orangeite activity, presumably related to the location of the Marion hotspot in southern India at the time, suggests that thick lithosphere was preserved, at least locally, up to the late Cretaceous, and was not entirely destroyed during the breakup of Gondwana, as inferred by some recent geophysical models.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (837KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe shoreline change extraction and change detection analysis is an important task that has application in different fields such as development of setback planning, hazard zoning, erosion-accretion studies, regional sediment budgets and conceptual or predictive modeling of coastal morphodynamics. Shoreline delineation is difficult, time consuming, and sometimes impossible for entire coastal system when using traditional ground survey techniques. Recent advances in remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) techniques are overcoming the difficulties in extraction of shoreline position and detection of shoreline changes. In the present paper, an automatic shoreline detection method using histogram equalization and adaptive thresholding techniques is developed. The shoreline of Netravati-Gurpur rivermouth area along Mangalore coast, West Coast of India have been extracted from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS P6) LISS-III (2005, 2007 and 2010) and IRS R2 LISS-III (2013) satellite images using developed automatic shoreline detection method. The delineated shorelines have been analyzed using Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), a GIS Software tool for estimation of shoreline change rates through two statistical techniques such as, End Point Rate (EPR) and Linear Regression Rate (LRR). The Bengre spit, Northern sector of Netravati-Gurpur river mouth is under accretion an average of 2.95 m/yr (EPR) and 3.07 m/yr (LRR) and maximum accretion obtained is 8.51 m/yr (EPR) and 8.69 m/yr (LRR). Southern sector, the Ullal spit is under erosion an average of -0.56 m/yr (EPR) and -0.59 m/yr (LRR).'

Abstract: 'AbstractIntegration of remote sensing data and the geographical information system (GIS) for the exploration of groundwater resources has become a breakthrough in the field of groundwater research, which assists in assessing, monitoring, and conserving groundwater resources. In the present paper, various groundwater potential zones for the assessment of groundwater availability in Theni district have been delineated using remote sensing and GIS techniques. Survey of India toposheets and IRS-1C satellite imageries are used to prepare various thematic layers viz. lithology, slope, land-use, lineament, drainage, soil, and rainfall were transformed to raster data using feature to raster converter tool in ArcGIS. The raster maps of these factors are allocated a fixed score and weight computed from multi influencing factor (MIF) technique. Moreover, each weighted thematic layer is statistically computed to get the groundwater potential zones. The groundwater potential zones thus obtained were divided into four categories, viz., very poor, poor, good, and very good zones. The result depicts the groundwater potential zones in the study area and found to be helpful in better planning and management of groundwater resources.'

Abstract: 'AbstractMulti-source earth observation data are highly desirable in nowaday landslide hazard prediction modeling. Landslide Hazard Zonation (LHZ) is a very important content of landslide hazard prediction modeling. In this paper, take Wan county for instance, we investigate the potentials of derivation from hybrid data sets to study landslide hazard zonation based on the ordinal scale relative weighting-rating technique. LHZ is then performed with chosen factor layers including: buffer map of thrusts, lithology, slope angle and relative relief calculated from DEM, NDVI, buffer map of drainage and Lineaments extracted from the digital satellite scene (TM). Then the Landslide Hazard Index (LHI) value is calculated and landslide hazard zonation is decided by slicing LHI histogram. The statistics demonstrate that High stable slope zone, Stable slope zone, Quasi-stable slope zone, Relatively unstable slope zone, Unstable slope zone and Defended slope zone account for 2.20%, 14.02%, 39.88%, 28.27%, 12.17% and 3.47% respectively. Then, GPS deformation control points on the landslide bodies are used to verify the validity of the LHZ technique.'

Understanding the challenges of developing a groundwater governance framework for regions of extensive groundwater development versus relatively less-developed areas of groundwater development is important. The groundwater typology is a function of both, the hydrogeological aspects of groundwater and the socio-economic milieu that defines dependency on the groundwater resource, which is significant across users and uses in India.

Title: 'Regionally tuned algorithm to study the seasonal variation of suspended sediment concentration using IRS-P4 Ocean Colour Monitor data'
Author: 'Kumar'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110982312000099
Abstract: 'AbstractSatellite data product validation and algorithm development activities both require the substantial accumulation of high-quality in situ observations. Data were acquired from Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) and in situ observations for tuning of Tassan\xe2\x80\x99s algorithm (Tassan, 1994) to retrieve the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the coastal waters off southern Karnataka, India. Tassan\xe2\x80\x99s algorithm has been modified regionally by adopting statistical/graphical criteria to characterize the spatial and seasonal distribution of SSC. A concurrent and collocated datasets (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0120) of in situ SSC and OCM based remote sensing reflectance [Rrs(\xce\xbb) in bands 490, 555 and 670\xc2\xa0nm] were regressed. The linear fit yielded regionally tuned new coefficients which were replaced in place of Tassan\xe2\x80\x99s global coefficients. The tuned algorithm was shown to retrieve SSC with range of 1.1\xe2\x80\x9337.12\xc2\xa0mg/l, which means it can be used for coastal waters. Since in situ samples were collected within the continental margin (average depth of \xe2\x88\xbc20\xc2\xa0m), we retain the global SSC algorithm (Tassan, 1994) approach for deeper bathymetric values (>50\xc2\xa0m depth) where we have no in situ measurements. Comparative analysis indicated statistically significant relationship (R2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.99; n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa045; p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05 at 95% confidence level) between in situ SSC and regionally tuned algorithm based SSC, with bias of 0.36\xc2\xa0mg/l and root mean square (RMS) difference of 0.73\xc2\xa0mg/l. This result clearly demonstrated the improvement of SSC measurement from OCM using regionally tuned Tassan\xe2\x80\x99s algorithm (RMS\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.73\xc2\xa0mg/l) over the globally coefficient based Tassan\xe2\x80\x99s algorithm (RMS\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa016.1\xc2\xa0mg/l).The tuned regional algorithm was used to estimate SSC in 2004, 2005 and 2007 which shows the concentration varied from 1.13 to 28.1\xc2\xa0mg/l in 2004, 1.84 to 23.12\xc2\xa0mg/l in 2005 and 2 to 27.85\xc2\xa0mg/l in 2007. Graphical and statistical methods using analysis of variance (ANOVA) have shown significant seasonal variability and inter-station spatial variability in SSC. Peak concentrations were recorded in the post-monsoon followed by the pre-monsoon period. The wind, wave and current pattern associated with southwest monsoon possibly controls the seasonal distribution, while nearshore turbulence and littoral transport influence the spatial distribution. This paper clearly demonstrated the potential application of regionally tuned algorithm for SSC mapping to study the spatial and seasonal pattern in shallow water off southern Karnataka.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Inter-trappean beds in lower one-third of Late Aptian Rajmahal volcanic succession.\xe2\x80\xa2Volcaniclastic rocks with quench textures and peperite, marine bentonite, black shale, oolite and plant fossils.\xe2\x80\xa2Extensive magma water interaction in coastal/shallow marine conditions.AbstractThe late Aptian (118\xe2\x80\x93115\xc2\xa0Ma) continental flood basalts of the Rajmahal Volcanic Province (RVP) are part of the Kerguelen Large Igneous Province, and constitute the uppermost part of the Gondwana Supergroup on the eastern Indian shield margin. The lower one-third of the Rajmahal volcanic succession contains thin layers of plant fossil-rich inter-trappean sedimentary rocks with pyroclasts, bentonite, grey and black shale/mudstone and oolite, whereas the upper two-thirds consist of sub-aerial fine-grained aphyric basalts with no inter-trappean material. At the eastern margin and the north-central sector of the RVP, the volcanics in the lower part include rhyolites and dacites overlain by enstatite-bearing basalts and enstatite-andesites. The pyroclastic rocks are largely felsic in composition, and comprise ignimbrite as well as coarse-grained tuff with lithic clasts, and tuff breccia with bombs, lapilli and ash that indicate explosive eruption of viscous rhyolitic magma. The rhyolites/dacites (>68\xc2\xa0wt.%) are separated from the andesites (<60\xc2\xa0wt.%) by a gap in silica content indicating their formation through upper crustal anatexis with only heat supplied by the basaltic magma. On the other hand, partially melted siltstone xenoliths in enstatite-bearing basalts suggest that the enstatite-andesites originated through mixing of the upper crust with basaltic magma, crystallizing orthopyroxene at a pressure-temperature of \xe2\x88\xbc3\xc2\xa0kb/1150\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C. In contrast, the northwestern sector of the RVP is devoid of felsic-intermediate rocks, and the volcaniclastic rocks are predominantly mafic (basaltic) in composition. Here, the presence of fine-grained tuffs, tuff breccia containing sideromelane shards and quenched texture, welded tuff breccia, peperite, shale/mudstone and oolite substantiates a subaqueous environment. Based on these observations, we conclude that the early phase of Rajmahal volcanism occurred under predominantly subaqueous conditions. The presence of grey and black shale/mudstone in the lower one-third of the succession across the entire Rajmahal basin provides unequivocal evidence of a shallow-marine continental shelf-type environment. Alignment of the Rajmahal eruptive centers with a major N\xe2\x80\x93S mid-Neoproterozoic lineament and the presence of a gravity high on the RVP suggest a tectonic control for the eruption of melts associated with the Kerguelen plume that was active in a post-Gondwana rift between India and Australia-Antarctica.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (687KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Tidal intrusion within a mega delta: An unstructured grid modelling approach'
Author: 'Lucy M.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771416303791
Abstract: "AbstractThe finite volume community ocean model (FVCOM) has been applied to the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) delta in the northern part of the Bay of Bengal in order to simulate tidal hydrodynamics and freshwater flow in a complex river system. The delta region is data-poor in observations of both bathymetry and water level; making it a challenge for accurate hydrodynamic models be configured for and validated in this area. This is the first 3D baroclinic model covering the whole GBM delta from deep water beyond the shelf break to 250\xc2\xa0km inland, the limit of tidal penetration.This paper examines what controls tidal penetration from the open coast into an intricate system of river channels. A modelling approach is used to improve understanding of the hydrodynamics of the GBM delta system. Tidal penetration is controlled by a combination of bathymetry, channel geometry, bottom friction, and river flow. The simulated tides must be validated before this delta model is used further to investigate baroclinic processes, river salinity and future change in this area. The performance of FVCOM tidal model configuration is evaluated at a range of sites in order to assess its ability to capture water levels which vary over both a tidal and seasonal cycle.FVCOM is seen to capture the leading tidal constituents well at coastal tide gauge stations, with small root-mean-squared errors of 10\xc2\xa0cm on average. Inland, the model compares favourably with twice daily observed water levels at thirteen stations where it is able to capture both tidal and annual timescales in the estuarine system. When the river discharge is particularly strong, the tidal range can be reduced as the tide and river are in direct competition.The bathymetry is found to be the most influential control on water levels within the delta, though tidal penetration can be significantly affected by the model's bottom roughness, and the inclusion of large river discharge. We discuss the generic problem of implementing a model in a data-poor region and the challenge of validating a hydrodynamic model from the open coast to narrow river channels."

Abstract: "AbstractFasting is one of the fundamental treatments of naturopathy. Use of lemon and honey for various medicinal purposes were documented since ancient days but there is a lack of evidence on short-term effects of lemon honey juice fasting (LHJF). Hence, we aim at evaluating the short-term effect of LHJF on lipid profile and body composition in healthy individuals. A total of 50 healthy subjects were recruited and they received 300-ml of LHJ, 4 times a day for four successive days of fasting. Assessments were performed before and after the intervention. Statistical analysis was performed by student's paired t-test with the use of Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version-16. Our study showed significant reduction in weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass (FM), free FM (FFM), and total serum triglycerides (TSTGs) with insignificant reduction in fat percentage and total serum cholesterol compared to baseline. Within group analysis of females showed similar results, unlike males. Our results suggest that LHJF may be useful for reduction of body weight, BMI, FM, FFM, and TSTG in healthy individuals, which might be useful for the prevention of obesity and hypertriglyceridemia."

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2An in vitro propagation system for Senecio candicans has been established for the first time.\xe2\x80\xa2The aqueous extract from the in vitro callus showed antioxidant capability, but the percentage of inhibition was less compared to the in vivo leaf.\xe2\x80\xa2The in vitro callus could be used effectively for the isolation of bioactive components.AbstractSenecio candicans DC is an endemic sub-shrubby climber and the hot water extract of this plant is being used traditionally for the treatment of gastric ulcer. The first objective of the present study was to design a standardized protocol for in vitro regeneration of S. candicans from leaf explants and compare the antioxidant activities of aqueous extracts of in vitro calluses and in vivo leaves by three different methods. Callus was initiated on Murashige and Skoog's (MS) basal media supplemented with various concentrations (0.5\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01 to 2.0\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01) and combinations of auxins and cytokinins under dark incubation for 2\xc2\xa0weeks. The percentage of callus induction (PCI) and the fresh weights were recorded after 28\xc2\xa0days of culture. The fresh weights were again recorded after 4\xc2\xa0weeks of sub-culture to determine the relative fresh weight growth (RFWG). The highest PCI of 87% and RFWG of 3.245 were obtained on an MS medium supplemented with 6-benzyl amino purine (BA) 2\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01 and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) 2\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01. The callus obtained after 28\xc2\xa0days of culture were inoculated on MS medium supplemented with different growth regulators. The maximum average shoot length (4.28\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.27\xc2\xa0cm) and maximum percentage of shoot induction (81%) was observed on MS medium supplemented with BA (2.0\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01)\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0IAA (1.0\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01). The maximum root induction percentage (90%) from shoots was observed on half strength MS medium fortified with 3.0\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01 \xce\xb1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) alone. The antioxidant activity of in vivo leaf was significantly high compared to the in vitro callus in all the three antioxidant assays. A linear correlation between antioxidant activity and the total phenolic content was observed. The current protocol for in vitro regeneration would pave the way for further research on the isolation of bioactive compounds including antioxidants by cell suspension culture."

Title: 'Frugivory and seed dispersal by vertebrates in tropical and subtropical Asia: An update'
Author: 'Richard T.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989417300860
Abstract: 'AbstractSeed dispersal is a key process in plant communities and frugivory is very important in vertebrate communities. This paper updates a review of frugivory and seed dispersal by vertebrates in the Oriental Region (tropical and subtropical Asia) published in 1998. The major conclusions remain the same. Small fruits are consumed by a wide range of potential seed dispersal agents, including species that thrive in small forest fragments and degraded landscapes. Larger and larger-seeded fruits are consumed by progressively fewer dispersers, and the largest depend on a few species of mammals and birds which are highly vulnerable to hunting, fragmentation, and habitat loss. Controlling hunting in both forest areas and the agricultural matrix must be a top priority for conservation. A lot more natural history information has been added to the literature since 1998. This reinforces previous evidence for the importance of hornbills, bulbuls, elephants, gibbons, civets, and fruit bats in seed dispersal, and suggests that the roles of green pigeons, macaques, rodents, bears, and deer were previously underestimated. The taxa for which additional natural history observations would be most valuable include fish, pheasants, pigeons, babblers, rodents, and even-toed ungulates. For other animal taxa, future frugivory and seed dispersal studies need to focus more on the fitness consequences for both the plants and the animals.'

Abstract: "AbstractObjectiveTo report the patterns of species diversity, and regenerating capacity in the forest of Nikyal valley in relation to environmental variables and underlying anthropogenic influence.MethodsA study area was selected in a traditionally managed mountain woody pasture during July 2012 to June 2013. The area was sampled by quadrat method. The quadrats were laid down at regular intervals of 150 m. The size of quadrats was kept 10\xc3\x9710, 5\xc3\x975 and 1\xc3\x971 m2 for trees, shrubs and herbs respectively. Density, frequency and cover were recorded. Importance value index of each plant species was calculated and plant communities were named after the plant species having the highest IV. Then diversity, its components and regenerating capacity were calculated with their formulas.ResultsShannon's diversity ranged from 2.75 to 3.31, Simpson's diversity, 0.90 to 0.95; Menhinick's diversity, 0.83 to 1.19; evenness, 0.41 to 0.65; species richness, 4.89 to 6.08 and maturity index, 30 to 44 species distribution pattern. Diversity values were similar to the other Himalayan forests. Pinus roxburghaii was the only regenerating species whereas the remaining four tree species including Qurecus dilatata regenerate up to 100 cm; they are at extreme risk of elimination due to anthropogenic factors.ConclusionsNikyal valley is under severe deforestation pressure for fuel and timber value. There is an urgent need to promote the ethics among the people that improvement and conservation of natural resources are critical for land and soil management."

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Crop loss, caste, and resources affect income diversification in a poor and remote area of India.\xe2\x80\xa2Social networks amplify the effects of those characteristics on income diversification.\xe2\x80\xa2The number of network connections is more important than centrality of connections.SummaryIncome diversification continues to be a key strategy for poor rural households, including those that are progressively developing and those operating under increasing distress. The ability of a household to diversify has been shown to depend upon its demographic and economic characteristics and its physical and social context. This paper considers the effects of intra-village social networks on household income diversification in one of the poorest and most ethnically diverse areas of the Indian state of Kerala. Using techniques adapted from spatial econometrics, we find that social connections within a village magnify the impacts of household characteristics such as education and number of adults by a factor of 3.6 times. Models with alternative measures of network centrality (degree and eigenvector) indicate that the number of network connections that a household has is more important than the centrality of those connections. Finally, we use social contact information to calculate assortative mixing based on caste. The results suggest social stratification in these villages, with higher levels of stratification associated with lower levels of income diversification.'

Abstract: 'AbstractBoerhavia diffusa (B. diffusa), also known as Punarnava, is an indigenous plant in India and an important component in traditional Indian medicine. The accurate identification and collection of this medicinal herb is vital to enhance the drug\xe2\x80\x99s efficacy and biosafety. In this study, a DNA barcoding technique has been applied to identify and distinguish B. diffusa from its closely-related species. The phylogenetic analysis was carried out for the four species of Boerhavia using barcode candidates including nuclear ribosomal DNA regions ITS, ITS1, ITS2 and the chloroplast plastid gene psbA-trnH. Sequence alignment revealed 26% polymorphic sites in ITS, 30% in ITS1, 16% in ITS2 and 6% in psbA-trnH, respectively. Additionally, a phylogenetic tree was constructed for 15 species using ITS sequences which clearly distinguished B. diffusa from the other species. The ITS1 demonstrates a higher transition/transversion ratio, percentage of variation and pairwise distance which differentiate B. diffusa from other species of Boerhavia. Our study revealed that ITS and ITS1 could be used as potential candidate regions for identifying B. diffusa and for authenticating its herbal products.'

Title: 'Optimal Hybrid Power System Using Renewables and Hydrogen for an Isolated Island in the UK\xe2\x98\x86'
Author: 'Niamh'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610217305623
Abstract: 'AbstractA distributed electrical power system using renewable generations (RG) on an island was studied. The original system includes micro hydropower stations, wind turbines and solar PVs with a bank of batteries for storage of the extra power from the renewables; and two diesel generators were used as the back-up units. From the analysis of historic electricity generation and consumption data, it was found that the RG alone could not meet the total demand and the diesel generator(s) needed running occasionally in 8 months in one year. In order to make the electric power supply completely from renewables, one novel solution using hydrogen generated from extra renewable electricity to replace diesel as the fuel for the diesel generators was proposed, i.e. a sub-system of renewable hydrogen generation (RHG), which composed of extra wind turbines, a water electrolyser and a hydrogen storage tank, were added to the renewable system. A technical and economic performance evaluation of the RG system was carried out using HOMER software. The results showed that the RHG sub-system produced and stored enough hydrogen for the diesel generator(s) to generate electricity whenever needed. In this way, the power supply on the island will be completely from renewables and zero CO2 emission without using diesel. The cost of electricity (COE) of the new system was \xc2\xa30.776 per kilowatt hour.'

Title: 'Soil Water Retention Curve from Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity for Sandy Loam and Loamy Sand Textured Soils\xe2\x98\x86'

Abstract: 'AbstractKnowledge of the soil hydraulic properties is indispensable to solve many soil and water management problems related to agriculture, ecology, and environmental issues. Soil hydraulic properties are key factors that regulate the movement of groundwater and transport of solutes. The most important hydraulic properties of soils are the soil water retention curve (SWRC) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (ks). Determination of these hydraulic properties is needed for many studies and applications related to irrigation, drainage, water movement and solute transport in the soil. Although many advances are made for direct measurements of SWRC and ks, they are usually time consuming and costly. Some attempts have been made to indirectly predict these hydraulic properties. The objective of this study was to derive an empirical relationship to estimate soil water retention curve from saturated hydraulic conductivity. One hundred and one soil samples were collected from agricultural and forest sites at different depths, at different locations in the Pavanje river basin that lies in the southern coastal region of Karnataka, India. The saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured in the laboratory by variable falling head method using Permeameter and soil water retention curve data was obtained through pressure plate apparatus for all the agricultural and forest soils. Prediction accuracies were evaluated using coefficient of determination, root mean square error, mean error, Akaike Information Criteria, between measured and predicted values. The results obtained from the prediction of soil moisture retention curve from saturated hydraulic conductivity, shows that the developed relationship are reasonably useful to get the soil moisture retention curve for the soils of agricultural and forested hillslopes of the region under consideration.'

Title: 'Evaluation of Three Soil Erosion Models for Small Watersheds\xe2\x98\x86'
Author: 'T.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe present study aims at evaluating three soil erosion models; Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE); Unit Sediment graph (USG) and Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP). The models were tested on small watersheds within the Pamba River basin of Kerala, India, using the data on observed rainfall-runoff-sediment yield events. Three watersheds are selected with varying land use types, topography and drainage density. Three erosion models were applied for the same rainfall events and the results were compared with the observed sediment yield values. It was seen that the USG predicted the rate of sediment yield better than the other two models. Even though WEPP is a physically distributed model, the large and detailed data requirement, which is impractical in studies of this scale, affected its prediction accuracy. Application MUSLE gives the large errors compared to the observed sediment yield. Therefore, it was found from this study that the Unit Sediment Graph (USG) based approach is having better applicability for the prevailing climatic and geographical setup.'

Abstract: 'AbstractWatershed management is the process of formulating and carrying out a course of action involving manipulation of natural system of a watershed to achieve specified objectives. This implies the proper use of land and water resources of watershed for optimum production with minimum hazard to natural resources. Remote sensing and GIS techniques have emerged as powerful tools for watershed management programmes. The study area, Harangi Catchment geographically lies between 750 38\xe2\x80\x99 E and 750 55\xe2\x80\x99 E longitude and 120 24\xe2\x80\x99 N and 120 40\xe2\x80\x99 N latitude with an area of 417.54 sq km. In the present study an attempt was made to understand the hydrological processes of the catchment at watershed level by deriving the watershed parameters through Remote Sensing, GIS and other data. Based on the drainage pattern and topography, thirteen watersheds were delineated to understand the hydrological process of the catchment at the watershed level. The drainage density of the watersheds varies from 1.36 to 3.42\xc2\xa0km/km2 which indicate that the area is coarse texture. Runoff was estimated using USDA Soil Conservation Services (SCS) Curve Number model. The information such as land use/ land cover and hydrological soil group map derived from remotely sensed data were overlayed through ArcGIS software to assign the curve number on polygon wise. Soil erosion was estimated by using Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). The weighted soil erosion estimated for the catchment was 19 t/ha/year, which is a moderate soil loss and needs conservation measures.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of extraction method with respect to time of exposure on total phenolic content and antioxidant potential of methanolic extracts (95%) from Achyranthes aspera leaves, stem and roots. Total phenolic content (TPC) was determined using the Folin\xe2\x80\x93Ciocalteu method and antioxidant potential was tested using DPPH radical scavenging and FRAP assays. Plant populations aged 60 and 120\xc2\xa0days were considered during the study. Overall, highest TPC was evident in mature plants (120\xc2\xa0days) compared to younger (60\xc2\xa0days). Similarly, leaves accumulated higher phenolics followed by roots and stem. Results showed the MAE technique to be efficient over USE and CSE methods. Same was evident in both the antioxidant assays tested. A similar trend was observed in both antioxidant assays as that of TPC, indicating phenolics to be the major contributor in the antioxidant potential of the plant. In conclusion it can be said that the yield of phenolic compounds depends on parameters viz. age of plant, part used for extraction, method of extraction and time required for the same.'

Abstract: 'Abstract\xce\xb2-Glucuronidase inhibitors are suggested as potential hepatoprotective agents. Swertia chirayita (Roxb.) Buch.-Ham. ex C.B. Clarke, Gentianaceae, is known for its hepatoprotective and anti-hepatotoxic activity in Ayurvedic system of medicine for ages. This plant is substituted by other species like S. decussata Nimmo ex C.B. Clarke and S. bimaculata (Siebold & Zucc.) Hook. f. & Thomson ex C.B. Clarke. The aim of the study was to compare metabolite profile and \xce\xb2-glucuronidase inhibitory activity of these three important species of Swertia and to identify the active constituents. S. chirayita (IC50 210.97\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml) and S. decussata (IC50 269.7\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml) showed \xce\xb2-glucuronidase inhibitory activity significantly higher than that of silymarin, the known inhibitor of the enzyme. The activity of S. bimaculata was low. The metabolites present in the three species were analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS based metabolomics approach. Five amino acids, twenty one organic acids, one inorganic acid, eight fatty acids, twenty one phenols including xanthones, eight sugars, seven sugar alcohols, five terpenoids and amarogentin were identified. Activities of the xanthones mangiferin (IC50 16.06\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml), swerchirin (IC50 162.84\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml), decussatin (IC50 195.11\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml), 1-hydroxy-3,5,8-trimethoxy xanthone (IC50 245.97\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml), bellidifolin (IC50 390.26\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml) were significantly higher than that of silymarin (IC50 794.62\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml).

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2To conserve the tiger it is critical to enable the persistence of the species across larger landscapes.\xe2\x80\xa2Establishing protected areas for tiger recovery remains one of the means of landscape approach.\xe2\x80\xa2While the gazetting of protected areas is necessary to enable this, it is not sufficient.\xe2\x80\xa2It is essential to benchmark and monitor the process that enable the recovery of tigers.AbstractTo conserve a large, wide-ranging carnivore like the tiger, it is critical not only to maintain populations at key habitat sites, but also to enable the persistence of the species across much larger landscapes. To do this, it is important to establish well-linked habitat networks where sites for survival and reproduction of tigers are complemented by opportunities for dispersal and colonization. On the ground, expanding protection to areas with a potential for tiger recovery still remains the means of operationalizing the landscape approach. Yet, while the gazetting of protected areas is necessary to enable this, it is not sufficient. It is essential to benchmark and monitor the process by which establishment of protected areas must necessarily be followed by management changes that enable a recovery of tigers, their prey and their habitats. In this paper, we report a case study from the Cauvery and Malai Mahadeshwara Hills Wildlife Sanctuaries of southern India, where we document the infrastructural and institutional changes that ensued after an unprecedented expansion of protected areas in this landscape. Further, we establish ecological benchmarks of the abundance and distribution of tigers, the relative abundance of their prey, and the status of their habitats, against which the recovery of tigers in this area of vast conservation potential may be assessed over time.'

Title: 'Quorum quenching activity in cell-free lysate of endophytic bacteria isolated from Pterocarpus santalinus Linn., and its effect on quorum sensing regulated biofilm in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1'
Author: 'P.S.'

Abstract: 'AbstractQuorum sensing mechanism allows the microorganisms to resist the antibiotic treatment by forming biofilms. Quorum quenching is one of the mechanisms to control the development of drug resistance in microbes. Endophyte bacteria are beneficial to plant growth as they support the immune system against the pathogen attack. The endophytic bacteria present in Pterocarpus santalinus were screened for the presence of N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) degrading bacteria using biosensor strains and further confirmed by quantifying the violacein production. Cell-free lysate of endophytic bacteria, Bacillus firmus PT18 and Enterobacter asburiae PT39 exhibited potent AHL degrading ability by inhibiting about 80% violacein production in biosensor strain. Furthermore, when the cell-free lysate was applied to Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and PAO1-JP2 biofilm it resulted in significant (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01) inhibition of biofilm formation. The biofilm inhibition was confirmed by visualization of biofilm slides under fluorescence microscopy, which showed decrease in total biomass formation in treated slides. Isolation and amplification of the gene (aiiA) indicated that the presence of AHL lactonase in cell-free lysate and sequence alignment indicated that AiiA contains a \xe2\x80\x9cHXHXDH\xe2\x80\x9d zinc-binding motif that is being conserved in several groups of metallohydrolases. Therefore, the study shows the potential of AHLs degradation by AHL lactonase present in cell-free lysate of isolated endophytic bacteria and inhibition of quorum sensing regulated biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa PAO1.'

Title: 'Research paperLesser Himalayan sequences in Eastern Himalaya and their deformation: Implications for Paleoproterozoic tectonic activity along the northern margin of India'

Abstract: 'AbstractSubstantial part of the northern margin of Indian plate is subducted beneath the Eurasian plate during the Caenozoic Himalayan orogeny, obscuring older tectonic events in the Lesser Himalaya known to host Proterozoic sedimentary successions and granitic bodies. Tectonostratigraphic units of the Proterozoic Lesser Himalayan sequence (LHS) of Eastern Himalaya, namely the Daling Group in Sikkim and the Bomdila Group in Arunachal Pradesh, provide clues to the nature and extent of Proterozoic passive margin sedimentation, their involvement in pre-Himalayan orogeny and implications for supercontinent reconstruction. The Daling Group, consisting of flaggy quartzite, meta-greywacke and metapelite with minor mafic dyke and sill, and the overlying Buxa Formation with stromatolitic carbonate-quartzite-slate, represent shallow marine, passive margin platformal association. Similar lithostratigraphy and broad depositional framework, and available geochronological data from intrusive granites in Eastern Himalaya indicate strikewise continuity of a shallow marine Paleoproterozoic platformal sequence up to Arunachal Pradesh through Bhutan. Multiple fold sets and tectonic foliations in LHS formed during partial or complete closure of the sea/ocean along the northern margin of Paleoproterozoic India. Such deformation fabrics are absent in the upper Palaeozoic\xe2\x80\x93Mesozoic Gondwana formations in the Lesser Himalaya of Darjeeling-Sikkim indicating influence of older orogeny. Kinematic analysis based on microstructure, and garnet composition suggest Paleoproterozoic deformation and metamorphism of LHS to be distinct from those associated with the foreland propagating thrust systems of the Caenozoic Himalayan collisional belt. Two possibilities are argued here: (1) the low greenschist facies domain in the LHS enveloped the amphibolite to granulite facies domains, which were later tectonically severed; (2) the\xc2\xa0older deformation and metamorphism relate to a Pacific type accretionary orogen which affected the northern margin of greater India.

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper contributes to the diversity and stand structure of the mangroves in Kerala, India, using multivariate methods. Floristic diversity of mangroves comprised 18 species of true mangroves of which, Sonneratia alba, Avicennia alba, and Ceriops tagal were found to be rare whereas Bruguiera parviflora was extinct in the State. Structural analyses revealed the importance of Avicennia officinalis and the domination of Acanthus ilicifolius. The mean stem density ranged from 10 to 13846 no/ha while the mean basal area ranged from 0.02 to 20.19 m2/ha. Multivariate analysis of true mangroves could be classified into five floristic groups based on stem density \xe2\x80\x93 Group 1 comprised Rhizophora mucronata, R. apiculata, Ceriops tagal, Kandelia candel, Sonneratia alba and Sonneratia caseolaris, that were seen in the fringing zone. A combination of Group 2 and Group 3 comprised Avicennia marina, A. alba, Lumnitzera racemosa, Acrostichum aureum, Excoecaria agallocha, E. indica, Avicennia officinalis, Bruguiera gymnorhiza and Aegiceras corniculatum, found in the intermediate zone, while Bruguiera sexangula, B. cylindrica occurred in the landward regions that constituted Group 4. Acanthus ilicifolius, having a widespread distribution, was found in all the three zones represented by Group 5. Tidal elevation was found to be important in shaping the observed zonation.'

Abstract: 'SummaryHoneybees, like humans and most other vertebrates, are colour-blind in dim light. Bees are primarily day-active and have apposition compound eyes, the typical eye design of diurnal insects. Most bees are trichromats with photoreceptors sensitive in the UV, blue and green [1]. While their diurnal colour vision was established almost 100 years ago, honeybees are known to be colour-blind in moonlight [2]. Here, we present the first evidence that the only known obligately nocturnal bee, the Indian carpenter bee Xylocopa tranquebarica (Fabricius), which flies even on moonless nights [3], uses colour vision to discriminate artificial landmarks at the nest in starlight. Humans, in contrast, are colour-blind at half-moon illumination. This finding, obtained using natural nests under natural illumination, is remarkable because insensitive apposition eyes were thought unable to support nocturnal colour vision. Hitherto, nocturnal colour vision was known only in nocturnal hawkmoths [4] and geckos [5], animals with eyes well adapted to nocturnality.'

Author: 'Robert A.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468265917301142
Abstract: "AbstractPrevailing dogma asserts that the uplift of Tibet, the onset of the Asian monsoon system and high biodiversity in southern Asia are linked, and that all occurred after 23 million years ago in the Neogene. Here, spanning the last 60 million years of Earth history, the geological, climatological and palaeontological evidence for this linkage is reviewed. The principal conclusions are that: 1) A proto-Tibetan highland existed well before the Neogene and that an Andean type topography with surface elevations of at least 4.5\xc2\xa0km existed at the start of the Eocene, before final closure of the Tethys Ocean that separated India from Eurasia. 2) The Himalaya were formed not at the start of the India\xe2\x80\x93Eurasia collision, but after much of Tibet had achieved its present elevation. The Himalaya built against a pre-existing proto-Tibetan highland and only projected above the average height of the plateau after approximately 15\xc2\xa0Ma. 3) Monsoon climates have existed across southern Asia for the whole of the Cenozoic, and probably for a lot longer, but that they were of the kind generated by seasonal migrations of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone. 4) The projection of the High Himalaya above the Tibetan Plateau at about 15\xc2\xa0Ma coincides with the development of the modern South Asia Monsoon. 5) The East Asia monsoon became established in its present form about the same time as a consequence of topographic changes in northern Tibet and elsewhere in Asia, the loss of moisture sources in the Asian interior and the development of a strong winter Siberian high as global temperatures declined. 6) New radiometric dates of palaeontological finds point to southern Asia's high biodiversity originating in the Paleogene, not the Neogene."

Title: 'Salient Long-term Observations of SST along Kerala Coast and its Comparative Variation with Lakshadweep Coast\xe2\x98\x86'
Author: 'A.M.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214241X15000735
Abstract: 'AbstractSea Surface Temperature (SST), being one of the most important geo-physical parameters in the ocean, plays an important role in global climate change. The spatial attribute of oceanographic data makes them highly suitable for GIS analysis as GIS provides a natural framework for the acquisition, storage, and analysis of georeferenced data. In the present study we estimate the recent SST trends using a satellite-based climatology to characterize changes in sea surface temperature along Kerala coast since 1985. These SST variations are mapped using thermal infrared remote sensing and microwave remote sensing satellites through day and night. SST measurements derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for 26 years (1985 to 2010) period were examined. The trend analysis of annual mean SST shows that inter-annual mode of SST variations dominates. An increasing trend of SST is observed in the off shore area of Kerala coast. The increasing trend about 0.20C per decade is observed in the study area. The higher rate of increment of SST in Kerala coast may be attributed to rapid industrialization, increase in air temperature. The SST analysis for Lakshadweep islands is also done and the results are compared with that of Kerala coast. It is found that the SST of Kerala coast is higher during day time and lower during night time which may be influenced by the presence of landmass nearby. While the SST variations of Lakshadweep area are part of the regional scale factors.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe paper focuses on a method of detecting and monitoring vegetation health in near-real time using freely available remote sensed satellite data and open source tools. Unhealthy vegetation condition can be interpreted as a signal to indicate the onset of drought. Recently Northern Kerala has been experiencing an increasing number of drought incidents due to weather anomalies and developmental pressures resulting in economic losses. Early detection of drought and dissemination of this information can help the State machinery to take necessary steps to mitigate drought impacts. The NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) image is generated from the AOI (Area of Interest) satellite images obtained in the NIR and Red band. Satellite images captured by Terra satellite were uploaded in the internet ftp server within 24\xc2\xa0hours. The uploaded satellite data is searched and automatically downloaded using web services by the software application developed and processed, within 10-30\xc2\xa0minutes. The process include generation of NDVI by an algorithm and the application automatically updates the recent NDVI map in the Web Server and is uploaded in the Intranet Web Server using open source software. The latest NDVI image map thus generated can be viewed through web browser in the organization intranet. Thus the Vegetation Health status of a day can be monitored the following day. Since the vegetation health do not change significantly overnight this can be considered as Near Real Time Monitoring with respect to Vegetation health. This map can be downloaded by potential users and analyzed according to the spatial area of interest.'

It has many oil fields; H-field is one of the new discoveries in NC-186 concession in Murzuq Basin, Libya. This field has been affected by the structural and tectonic movements of Murzuq Basin and created paleo-high during the post-Hawaz erosional events. Ten exploratory wells were drilled for that field and well logging data were collected. The well logging data include Self potential, Gamma ray, Calipee, Resistivity, and Porosity logs (sonic, neutron, density). The recorded well logging data have been used for quick look interpretation and then correlated with both core data report and the plotted crossplots. The quick look results indicate that this reservoir is clean, highly porous and permeable. This reservoir is divided into 8 units/horizons (from H1 to H8), which are mainly sandstone with few intercalations of clay. Both well logging and core data are highly concordant. The results of the petrophysical characteristics have ascertained that H4\xe2\x80\x93H6 are oil bearing zones while H7\xe2\x80\x93H8 are water bearing horizons.'

Title: 'A Comparative Study on the Derivation of Unit Hydrograph for Bharathapuzha River Basin\xe2\x98\x86'
Author: 'Abhinanda'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212017316300937
Abstract: 'AbstractSeveral techniques are available for the development of the unit hydrograph. But most of these traditional methods require manual fitting of the unit hydrograph through few points, which does not guarantee the area under the unit hydrograph to be unity. More over most of the stations are ungauged, due to which it becomes difficult to develop the unit hydrograph. So in order to overcome these problems, two methods have been considered in this study for the development of the unit hydrograph for Bharathapuzha river basin. They are the \xe2\x80\x9ctwo parameter Gamma distribution\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthree parameter Beta distribution\xe2\x80\x9d, both of which are based on Probability Distribution Functions (pdfs). The unit hydrograph developed by the two parameter Gamma distribution match well with the one developed by CWC method, but the unit hydrograph developed by the three parameter Beta distribution does not match well with the one developed by the CWC method. From the unit hydrograph, runoff hydrograph is convoluted for the year 2008. For this the hourly rainfall are generated from daily rainfall values by disaggregation. But on plotting, the simulated discharge hydrograph is found to be greater than the observed discharge. This may be due to non incorporation of the inflow outflow processes of many hydraulic structures such as dams, irrigation schemes etc, existing in the basin in the model study. The data related to these structures could not be obtained due to certain restriction in acquiring the data from authorized agencies.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2A novel procedure of \xe2\x80\x9cadapting images\xe2\x80\x9d is described for studying adaptation.\xe2\x80\xa2The images can simulate long term and theoretically complete adaptation states.\xe2\x80\xa2Measurements with these images provide clues about the function of adaptation.\xe2\x80\xa2Simple normalization is shown to benefit both perception and performance.AbstractCountless visual aftereffects have illustrated how visual sensitivity and perception can be biased by adaptation to the recent temporal context. This contextual modulation has been proposed to serve a variety of functions, but the actual benefits of adaptation remain uncertain. We describe an approach we have recently developed for exploring these benefits by adapting images instead of observers, to simulate how images should appear under theoretically optimal states of adaptation. This allows the long-term consequences of adaptation to be evaluated in ways that are difficult to probe by adapting observers, and provides a common framework for understanding how visual coding changes when the environment or the observer changes, or for evaluating how the effects of temporal context depend on different models of visual coding or the adaptation processes. The approach is illustrated for the specific case of adaptation to color, for which the initial neural coding and adaptation processes are relatively well understood, but can in principle be applied to examine the consequences of adaptation for any stimulus dimension. A simple calibration that adjusts each neuron\xe2\x80\x99s sensitivity according to the stimulus level it is exposed to is sufficient to normalize visual coding and generate a host of benefits, from increased efficiency to perceptual constancy to enhanced discrimination. This temporal normalization may also provide an important precursor for the effective operation of contextual mechanisms operating across space or feature dimensions. To the extent that the effects of adaptation can be predicted, images from new environments could be \xe2\x80\x9cpre-adapted\xe2\x80\x9d to match them to the observer, eliminating the need for observers to adapt.'

Abstract: "AbstractThe present urbanized world is on a vogue to remold its impression and character into someone else's. The new impressions often carries a complete disconnect from its roots which gradually loses its self and identity and never has a sustenance. In this context Form Based Coding(FBC) as a tool in Urban Design Process aids to come up with solutions whichstrongly holds the people to their community and closelyassociated with culture through the physical spaces they areassociated with. The paper has made an effort to analyze theprocess of FBC as a genuine tool to establish the association ofphysical form and spaces with the public realm to uphold thecontext and culture by taking a case in the heritage rich centralcommercial core of Thiruvananthapuram city, Chalai. Chalai isundergoing a tremendous transformation in its physical formdisregarding its strong culture and context and this can influencethe inherent native character of the bazaar activity and looses itsidentity in form and function. In this regard form Based Codingwill be a suitable tool to strengthen it as a native bazaar for thecity.A detailed documentation of form in relation with the existing layers of street pattern, activity, building types, and function is analysed and its influences to variations in form is studied. The existing codes of the built form of different uses were decoded. The comparison of existing codes with the theoretical parameters from literature and case studies lead to the formulation of codes with FBC as a tool suitable for the context."

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Asian Spiranthes (Orchidaceae) are monophyletic.\xe2\x80\xa2Asian Spiranthes arrived by long-distance dispersal from North America around 7 MYA.\xe2\x80\xa2Molecular approach aided the discovery of a cryptic species S. himalayensis.\xe2\x80\xa2S. hongkongensis is a hybrid of maternal S. sinensis and paternal S. himalayensis.\xe2\x80\xa2S. sinensis confirmed as a species complex using molecular markers.AbstractSpiranthes (\xe2\x88\xbc36 species, Orchidaceae) is a small genus with a global distribution. It has a center of diversity in North America with only a few species occurring in Asia. This study focuses on the Asian Spiranthes with an emphasis on understanding their biogeographic relationships and species delimitations using molecular markers. Our phylogenetic trees based on nuclear (ITS) and chloroplast (trnL-trnLF, matK and trnS-G) sequences from samples across their range in Asia revealed the Asian Spiranthes are monophyletic. Ancestral area optimization suggested that North America forms the ancestral region for the Asian Spiranthes rather than Europe suggesting that they originated from a single long-distance dispersal event. Our study also revealed the presence of a cryptic species S. himalayensis, which was discovered based on molecular data thus emphasizing the importance of wide geographical sampling in phylogenetic studies. Sequences of cloned ITS provided support for the hypothesis that natural hybridization between S. sinensis and the newly described S. himalayensis resulted in the allotetraploid S. hongkongensis, with S. himalayensis as the paternal parent. One of the species complexes known in Asia is the S. sinensis complex, which shows a wide occurrence and is known for local geographical variants. Some of these variants have been described as new species in Australia and New Zealand. Our studies show that all the sampled variants including the Australian and New Zealand species show monophyly despite having long branches. This suggests that there may be high rates of gene flow between the geographically distinct forms resulting in lack of species resolution within the S. sinensis complex.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (110KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe present study illustrates an integrated approach of remote sensing and GIS (Geographical Information System), i.e., Geospatial techniques for assessment of land use/cover dynamics of a town located in the foothill zone of the Uttarakhand State viz., the Ramnagar. Landsat satellite imageries of two different time periods, i.e., Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) of 1990 and 2010 were acquired by USGS Earth Explorer and quantified the land use/cover changes in the Ramnagar town from 1990 to 2010 over a period of two decades. Supervised Classification methodology has been employed using Maximum Likelihood Technique in ERDAS 9.3. The images of the study area were categorized into five different classes, viz. built-up area, vegetation, agricultural land, water bodies and sand bar. The results indicate that during the last two decades, built-up area and sand bar of the Ramnagar town area have been increased about 8.88% (i.e., 2.83\xc2\xa0km2) and 3.98% (i.e., 1.27\xc2\xa0km2), respectively, while area under other land categories such as vegetation, agricultural land and water body have decreased about 9.41% (i.e., 3.00\xc2\xa0km2), 0.69% (i.e., 0.22\xc2\xa0km2) and 2.76% (i.e. 0.88\xc2\xa0km2), respectively. The study reveals that the Ramnagar town is expanding maximum towards the southern direction along the National Highway-121. The paper also highlights the importance of digital change detection techniques for nature and location of change of the Ramnagar Town area.'

Abstract: 'AbstractGenus Adiantum L., Pteridaceae, is an important fern used in traditional systems of medicine. Different species of Adiantum are known as avenca in Brazil; hansraj/hanmspadi in India; maiden hair fern in English. The present study aims to develop the quality control parameters of four similar looking Adiantum species viz. A. capillus-veneris L., A. lunulatum Burm. f., A. peruvianum Klotzsch, and A. venustum D. Don. Standard methods for macro-microscopic evaluation, physicochemical parameters and HPTLC were used for authentication and identification. The salient distinctive characters under the microscope are the presence of slightly wavy elongated epidermal cells in A. capillus-veneris; epidermal cells strongly wavy in A. lunulatum; star shaped epidermal cells and mixed spores of regular and irregular shaped in A. peruvianum; stomata on both the surfaces of pinnule, absence of spinulus spores only in A. venustum. In addition, rachis anatomy showed different cellular and stellar characteristics as identifying characters of aforesaid four Adiantum species. Physico-chemical parameters and HPTLC finger print profiles along with stigmasterol and lupeol play significant role for the quality evaluation of raw drugs. The above finding will serve the purpose of quality control and assurance for the future studies.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe brown mussel Perna perna, an effective bioindicator species for monitoring radioactive pollution, was used to evaluate the concentration of 210Po in and around the coastal areas of Kanyakumari, a Monazite rich region. 210Po concentration in P. perna collected from ten different locations in this region exhibited values ranging between 78.09\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa05.5 and 320.00\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa018.1 Bq/kg (wet). Kalluvilai recorded the maximum concentration of 210Po (320.00\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa018.1\xc2\xa0Bq/kg), and hence further studies involving the activity of 210Po in other marine organisms and terrestrial samples were carried out from this site. The annual intake of 210Po by the population residing in this location via dietary sources was estimated. Similarly, the total annual committed effective dose to the public was found to be 2.24\xc2\xa0mSv/year. The results obtained were compared to the values reported by earlier studies in India and also in other countries.'

Title: 'Research PaperEstimating soil fertility status in physically degraded land using GIS and remote sensing techniques in Chamarajanagar district, Karnataka, India'

Abstract: 'AbstractSoil physical degradation is a major environmental problem throughout the world due to its negative impact on biomass and economic production. This study presented new ways of combining rapid soil analysis using GIS and remote sensing imagery to provide a precision mapping of soil physical condition indicators in the study area and producing fertility status using Geostatistical approach. Study has been carried out to map the areas with physical degradation using remotely sensed data from Indian Remote Sensing LISS III sensor. It was observed that the data enabled better delineation of small units of eroded areas. Satellite data have been used for qualitative assessment of areas, being subject to soil erosion. Soil erosion was found to be none or slight to very sever using visual interpretation of IRS data along with field survey method where soil erosion was found to be moderate to high using the RUSLE method. The eroded areas of degraded lands will be used as an input for planning reclamation and conservation programs in Chamarajanagar district of Karnataka.Soil compaction is a form of physical degradation resulting in densification and distortion of the soil where biological activity, porosity and permeability are reduced, strength is increased and soil structure partly destroyed. Compaction can reduce water infiltration capacity and increase erosion risk by accelerating run-off. The compaction process can be initiated by wheels, tracks, rollers or by the passage of animals. Some soils are naturally compacted, strongly cemented or have a thin topsoil layer on rock subsoil. Soils can vary from being sufficiently strong to resist all likely applied loads to being so weak that they are compacted by even light loads.'

Abstract: "AbstractThis paper proposes dividing of Black Sea Catchment Area's river basins into four morpho hydrographic regions \xe2\x80\x93 Dobrudja, East Balkan mountain, lowland of Burgas and Strandzha Mountain. It is based on geomorphologic and hydrographic characteristics of rivers and river basins (altitude, valleys, slopes, drainage density, river length, catchment shape, stream orders, and curve of the rivers). The work uses GIS to analyze and data of the rivers and the river basins collected from basic topographic maps. Digital Elevation Model (DEM), created on the base of satellite images, was also used. Based on the data collected for this study some basic hydrographical parameters were calculated. This is the first experiment of morpho-hydrographic dividing of the main catchment area in Bulgaria using river basins like basic units. It shows a way to unify separate river basins into major areas that can be useful for analyzing and research of water resources."

Abstract: 'AbstractThe occurrence and movement of groundwater especially in fractured bedrock aquifers in a given area is governed by many factors viz., topography, lithology, geological structures, fracture density, aperture and connectivity, secondary porosity. The study is an attempt to delineate groundwater potential zones in deep midland aquifers along the Bharathapuzha river basin, Kerala, India. The study area (\xe2\x88\xbc 840 km2) is part of the Bharathapuzha river basin (10\xcc\x8a 40\xe2\x80\xb2-10\xcc\x8a 50\xe2\x80\xb2 N latitude and 76\xcc\x8a 05\xe2\x80\xb2-76\xcc\x8a 30\xe2\x80\xb2 E longitude), is mainly underlain by massive Charnockite/Charnockite gneiss type of rock formation. Vertical Electrical Sounding data collected from 66 locations was interpreted qualitatively and quantitatively to obtain layered resistivity parameters and potential fractured zones in the deep aquifer. Thematic maps of drainage, geology, geomorphology, slope and lineaments were prepared using toposheets and IRS P6 LISS III imagery. Slope map shows steeper slopes in the southern and northeastern part of the study area. Dendritic to sub-dendritic drainage pattern is dominant in the area, is often controlled by lineaments and fault zones. Qualitative interpretation of vertical electrical sounding (VES) data shows multi-layered profiles in most of the locations (> 4 resistivity layers). Out of 66 VES curves, 24 nos. are 5 layered, 23 nos. are 6 layered, 17 are 7 layered and 2 are 4 layered. Resistivity of first layer varied from 11.9 \xce\xa9m (VES-37) to 8089 \xce\xa9m (VES-3) and thickness varied from 0.78 m (VES-37) to 4.79 m (VES-64). Resistivity of second layer varied from 35.3 \xce\xa9m (VES-3) to 11382 \xce\xa9m (VES-11) and thickness varied from 0.364 m (VES-11) to 11.3 m (VES-59). Bore wells of moderate to high yield tapping the deep aquifer zones are mainly located along lineament intersections.'

Abstract: 'AbstractMetropolitan cities in India are emerging as major economic hubs with an unprecedented land use changes and decline of environmental resources. Globalisation and consequent relaxations of Indian markets to global players has given impetus to rapid urbanisation process. Urbanisation being irreversible and rapid coupled with fast growth of population during the last century, contributed to serious ecological and environmental consequences. This necessitates monitoring and advance visualisation of spatial patterns of landscape dynamics for evolving appropriate management strategies towards sustainable development approaches. This study visualises the growth of Indian mega cities Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai and Coimbatore, through Cellular Automata Markov model considering the influence of agent(s) of urban growth through soft computing techniques. CA Markov model is considered to be one of most effective algorithm to visualise the growth of urban spatial structures. Prediction of growth using agent based modelling considering the spatial patterns of urbanisation during the past four decades has provided insights to the urban dynamics. The industrial, infrastructural, socio-economic factors significantly influence the urban growth compared to the biophysical factors. Visualisation of urban growth suggest agents driven growth in the cities and its surroundings with large land use transformations in urban corridors and upcoming Industrial and ear marked developmental zones. Integrating local agents of urban growth help in identifying specific regions of intense growth, likely challenges and provide opportunities for evolving appropriate management strategies towards sustainable cities during the 21st century.'

Abstract: 'AbstractAntiviral activity against H1N1 influenza was studied using ethnic medicinal plants of South India. Results revealed that Wrightia tinctoria (2.25\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml) was one of the best antidotes against H1N1 virus in terms of inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC50) whereas the control drug Oseltamivir showed 6.44\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml. Strychnos minor, Diotacanthus albiflorus and Cayratia pedata showed low cytotoxicity (>100) to the MDCK (Malin darby canine kidney) cells by cytotoxicity concentration of 50% (CC50) and possessed antiviral activity suggesting that these plants can be used as herbal capsules for H1N1 virus. W. tinctoria and S. minor showed high therapeutic indexes (TI) such as 12.67 and 21.97 suggesting that those plants can be used for anti-viral drug development. The CC50 values of Eugenia singampattiana (0.3\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml), Vitex altissima (42\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml), Salacia oblonga (7.32\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml) and Salacia reticulata (7.36\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml) resulted in cytotoxicity of the MDCK cells, due to their high phenolic content.

The Urni landslide, situated on the right bank of the Satluj River, Himachal Pradesh (India) is taken as the case study. The Urni landslide has evolved into a complex landslide in the last two decade (2000\xe2\x80\x932016) and has dammed the Satluj River partially since year 2013, damaging \xe2\x88\xbc200\xc2\xa0m stretch of the National Highway (NH-05). The crown of the landslide exists at an altitude of \xe2\x88\xbc2180\xe2\x80\x932190\xc2\xa0m above msl, close to the Urni village that has a human population of about 500. The high resolution imagery shows \xe2\x88\xbc50\xc2\xa0m long landslide scarp and \xe2\x88\xbc100\xc2\xa0m long transverse cracks in the detached mass that implies potential for further slope failure movement. Further analysis shows that the landslide has attained an areal increase of 103,900\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01142\xc2\xa0m2 during year 2004\xe2\x80\x932016. About 86% of this areal increase occurred since year 2013. Abrupt increase in the annual mean rainfall is also observed since the year 2013. The extreme rainfall in the June, 2013; 11 June (\xe2\x88\xbc100\xc2\xa0mm) and 16 June (\xe2\x88\xbc115\xc2\xa0mm), are considered to be responsible for the slope failure in the Urni landslide that has partially dammed the river. The finite element modelling (FEM) based slope stability analysis revealed the shear strain in the order of 0.0\xe2\x80\x930.16 with 0.0\xe2\x80\x930.6\xc2\xa0m total displacement in the detachment zone.

Abstract: 'AbstractAn optimal operation plan has been developed for the reservoirs in Kuttiadi river basin in Kerala using systems approach. A system consists of three reservoirs namely; Banasurasagar in Wayanad district,Kakkayam and Peruvannamuzhi in Kozhikode district has been taken for the study. Banasurasagar reservoir is in Kabbini river basin, which is an east flowing river and the remaining two are in Kuttiadi river basin, which is a west flowing river. They serve different purposes such as irrigation, domestic water supply and hydropower generation. These purposes were fulfilled based on the Standard Linear Operation Policy (SLOP) developed during the early stages of project formulation. Considering the deficit of water in the region, a system study has been done using multi-reservoir multi-purpose simulation technique, in which reservoir rule curve- based policy to optimally utilize the conservation storage of these three reservoirs have been developed. The generalised simulation model developed at the National Institute of Hydrology has been used to derive the rule levels and simulation of the system. The simulation studies reveal that the Banasurasagar reservoir and Peruvannamuzhi reservoir always serve the purposes of water supply without fail. For Banasurasagar reservoir, irrigation and water supply reliability is found to be 86% where as for Peruvanannamuzhi reservoir, it is 77%. The demand for power generation can be met with 90% dependability. Reservoir linked water supply can be thought of from Banasurasagar reservoir to Wayanad district like water supply from Peruvannamuzhi reservoir to Kozhikode district.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper examines differences between Version 6 (V6) and Version 7 (V7) 3-hourly TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA 3B42) research products in JJA (June, July and August) and DJF (December, January and February) over a 13-year period from 1998 to 2010 on a global scale. Different surface types and rain regimes are considered in the comparison. The study finds that more rain events are found in V7 than those in V6 in both JJA and DJF, especially over oceans. Overall, both versions show a good agreement in moderate and heavy rain regimes. High Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s correlation coefficients are found in tropical rain band regions. Histograms of both versions are very similar; however higher frequencies of rain events are found in V7 in light rain regime, especially over oceans, than those in V6. For light rain, rainfall estimates in V6 are less than those in V7 over land and oceans in both seasons. For moderate rain, rainfall estimates in V6 are larger than those in V7 over land in most years. Over oceans, it is a mixed situation in which V6\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0V7 for some years and V6\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa0V7 for the other years. For heavy rain, rainfall estimates in V6 are larger than those in V7 throughout all JJA and DJF seasons for both land and oceans, which is also shown in a case study. Large variance in the individual differences is found in light rain and less in heavy rain. No apparent trends are observed. For light rain, all statistics support that there is an uncertainty issue in both versions.'

Abstract: 'AbstractCoastal erosion is a natural phenomenon affecting a large number of coastal areas. The coastal zone is an area with immense geological, geomorphological and ecological interest. Monitoring and mitigation of shoreline erosion along populated coastal areas is an important task and remains a difficult goal to achieve. The coast of Karnataka state extends from Talapadi in south to Sadashivgad in north covering a distance of about 280\xc2\xa0km. In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the shoreline transformation along the Karnataka coast. Fair weather satellite images of LANDSAT from 1991 to 2014 with an interval of eight years were used to delineate the shoreline. A Linear Regression Rate-of-change (LRR) and an End Point Rate (EPR) statistic was carried out using Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) computer software of United States Geological Survey (USGS). Highest EPR of about 15.96 m (1991-2014) was noticed in the Ankola taluk, whereas highest LRR was about 15.5 m in Karwar, both indicating accretion. Highest erosion was noticed in Honnavar with an LRR of 19.59 m respectively and EPR of 19.95 m.'

Abstract: "AbstractCoal accounts for more than 70% of total energy consumption in China. Kinds of ecological problems resulting from coal mining have become increasingly serious, which directly threaten regional ecological security and people's normal production and livelihood in some areas. Ecological vulnerability is the overall performance of the ecosystem change under mining development, thus evaluation of ecological vulnerability based on GIS in Fuxin mining master plan environmental impact assessment was presented in this article. According to ecological condition of Fuxin, the ecological vulnerability index was established synthetically reflecting ecological environmental status, ecological sensitivity and landscape spatial structure, including 9 indictors. The study area was divided into 247 grids, then the EVI value of each grid was calculated by comprehensive evaluation and the results were divided into 5 levels by Zonal Statistic analysis of ArcGIS. Combining the distribution of vulnerability classification with the important ecological function area and natural reserves in the scope of planning, the research area was plotted into five types of zone, i.e., appropriate exploitation zone, optimized exploitation zone, moderate exploitation zone, restrictive exploitation zone and forbidden exploitation zone. Several adjustment suggestions were put forward to optimize the layout of Fuxin mining area and guide the ecological protection during coal exploitation."

Abstract: 'AbstractBackgroundReactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals are produced during normal physiologic events in a healthy organism. Under pathological conditions ROS are overproduced resulting oxidative stress. This leads to oxidative modifications of the cellular membranes or intracellular molecules. It is accepted that the intake of antioxidant substances reinforces the defense against ROS.AimsTo evaluate the antioxidant activity of various solvent fractions of leaves extract of the plant Pterygota alata.MethodsCrude ethanol extract (CEE) of P. alata leaves and its various fractions such as n-hexane (HF), chloroform (CF), ethyl acetate (EF), and aqueous (AF) were subjected to assay for antioxidants activity. The in\xc2\xa0vitro antioxidant property was investigated by employing various established systems such as 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay, ferric reducing power assay, and total antioxidant capacity by the phosphomolybdenum assay. Mice with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver injury were used to assess antioxidant effect in\xc2\xa0vivo by examining the levels of malondialdehyde and tissue protein, and the activities of most important antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase using standard procedures.ResultsAmong the CEE and various fractions, CF exhibited strong antioxidant ability in\xc2\xa0vitro. The liver of CCl4-intoxicated animals exhibited a significant (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001) decrease in the superoxide dismutase level and a significant (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001) increase in the malondialdehyde level. Mice treated with CF and standard drug silymarin caused these values to return to normal level in CCl4-induced liver damage.ConclusionThe present study provides evidence that CF of CEE of P. alata leaves possesses excellent in\xc2\xa0vitro and in\xc2\xa0vivo antioxidant effects, which can be a potential source of natural antioxidants and should be further exploited for its use in clinical medicine.'

Abstract: 'AbstractObjectiveTo investigate antibacterial properties of the terrestrial fern Lygodium flexuosum (L. flexuosum) obtained from Kalahandi district, Odisha against enteric- and uro-pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples.MethodsFrond-extracts of L. flexuosum were obtained by the cold percolation method using four solvents, petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and water. Antibacterial potencies of concentrated cold frond-extracts were tested by the agar-well diffusion method against 7 multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria of which, 2 were Gram-positives, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), and 5 Gram-negatives, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis.ResultsThe cold-water frond-extract had the best antimicrobial activity against 7 MDR bacterial isolates, compared to extracts with other solvents. Values of zones of inhibition against MRSA and P. mirabilis were the highest, 29 mm. Zones of inhibition against VRE and P. aeruginosa were 25 mm, while those were 23 mm against E. aerogenes and E. coli. The least size of zone of inhibition 19 mm was recorded against K. pneumoniae. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of active frond-extracts with water, chloroform, methanol, and petroleum ether were recorded. For the water extract, the MIC value 1.562 mg/mL against MRSA and P. mirabilis, but the value 3.25 mg/mL against VRE, E. aerogenes and P. aeruginosa, while the value of 12.5 mg/mL against K. pneumoniae were recorded. MBC values were the least with chloroform-extracts, with the range 12.5 for 6 bacteria, excluding P. aeruginosa for which, the value 25 mg/mL was recorded as MBC.ConclusionsPhytochemical analysis of the water-extract of L. flexuosum confirmed the presence of glycosides and carbohydrates, but alkaloids, terpenoids, steroids, saponins, tannins, and flavonoids were absent. L. flexuosum, being a fern, is a suitable non-microbial source of antimicrobial for MDR strains of major enteric and uro-pathogens.'

Abstract: 'AbstractStudy regionBhadra basin (1968\xc2\xa0km2), located in peninsular India, is considered for demonstration.Study focusA general framework to assess the impact of climate change on the pattern of daily extreme streamflow events is proposed. Whereas, the impact is confirmed in the recent literature for most of the hydrologic variables at monthly/seasonal time scale, assessment and quantification at finer time scale, e.g. daily, is challenging. Complexity increases for the derived hydrologic variables, such as soil moisture and streamflow as compared to primary hydrologic variables, such as precipitation. The proposed general framework is demonstrated with the daily inflow to the Bhadra reservoir. Different statistical limits of extremes are defined and change in daily extreme pattern (number and magnitude) in the future (2006\xe2\x80\x932035) is assessed with respect to the baseline period (1971\xe2\x80\x932000).New hydrological insights for the regionDemonstration of the proposed methodology with the inflow to Bhadra reservoir reveals that the daily extreme events are expected to increase in number with the increase in the threshold of the extreme. For a particular threshold, the average magnitude of the extreme events in the future is found to be higher as compared to the baseline period. However, for monthly totals the case is not the same \xe2\x88\x92 it remains almost similar. The methodology, being general in nature, can be applied to other locations in order to assess the future change in streamflow and other derived variables.'

UHT crustal metamorphism is recognised in more than 50 localities globally in the metamorphic rock record and is accepted as \xe2\x80\x98normal\xe2\x80\x99 in the spectrum of regional crustal processes. UHT metamorphism is typically identified on the basis of diagnostic mineral assemblages such as sapphirine\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0quartz, orthopyroxene\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0sillimanite\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa0quartz and osumilite in Mg\xe2\x80\x93Al-rich rock compositions, now usually coupled with pseudosection-based thermobarometry using internally-consistent thermodynamic data sets and/or Al-in-Orthopyroxene and ternary feldspar thermobarometry. Significant progress in the understanding of regional UHT metamorphism in recent years includes: (1) development of a ferric iron activity\xe2\x80\x93composition thermodynamic model for sapphirine, allowing phase diagram calculations for oxidised rock compositions; (2) quantification of UHT conditions via trace element thermometry, with Zr-in-rutile more commonly recording higher temperatures than Ti-in-zircon. Rutile is likely to be stable at peak UHT conditions whereas zircon may only grow as UHT rocks are cooling. In addition, the extent to which Zr diffuses out of rutile is controlled by chemical communication with zircon; (3) more fully recognising and utilising temperature-dependent thermal properties of the crust, and the possible range of heat sources causing metamorphism in geodynamic modelling studies; (4) recognising that crust partially melted either in a previous event or earlier in a long-duration event has greater capacity than fertile, unmelted crust to achieve UHT conditions due to the heat energy consumed by partial melting reactions; (5) more strongly linking U\xe2\x80\x93Pb geochronological data from zircon and monazite to P\xe2\x80\x93T points or path segments through using Y\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0REE partitioning between accessory and major phases, as well as phase diagrams incorporating Zr and REE; and (6) improved insight into the settings and factors responsible for UHT metamorphism via geodynamic forward models. These models suggest that regional UHT metamorphism is, principally, geodynamically related to subduction, coupled with elevated crustal radiogenic heat generation rates.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractDriving in beach, a fascinating recreational activity is in vogue in a few special beaches in the world. Management plans are formulated for these beaches to overcome the adverse impact of beach driving on the overall coastal ecosystem and to ensure the safety of both the passengers and others who frequent the beach. The management plans for drive-in beaches often deal with the vehicle conditions such as tyre pressure, number of driving wheels and their dimensions and also the environmental conditions of the beach such as wave conditions, storms and stages of tide. However, such a management plan has not been formulated for the Muzhappilangad drive-in beach of Kerala on the southwest coast of India. Generally, this beach experiences only normal changes during the monsoon. However, during the 2013, a portion of the beach underwent severe recession which lead to the ban of vehicles to the eroded part of the beach. A portion of subsequently reformed beach became unfit for vehicle driving. Erosion brought changes to the wave breaking pattern. Plunging waves are observed at some stretches of the eroded beach; spilling breakers continued on either sides of this portion. After reformation, spilling breakers are observed in the entire length of the beach. Samples extracted from three depths by core cutter prior to erosion and after reformation revealed that the mean diameter and standard deviation of the particle changed significantly at the severely eroded portion where plunging breakers are experienced whereas; at other portion of the reformed beach, the changes in the particle size is very nominal.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Absence of trees in grasslands may be due to a lack of gaps in the grass root layer.\xe2\x80\xa2Moist upland sites had few juvenile trees showing that establishment is limiting.\xe2\x80\xa2Fine grass root biomass at upland sites was double than that at lowland sites.\xe2\x80\xa2Moist upland grassland sites had few or no \xe2\x80\x98gaps\xe2\x80\x99 in the grass root layer.\xe2\x80\xa2Dense grass roots may prevent seedling establishment.AbstractUpland grasslands in South Africa occur in climates warm enough and wet enough for forests yet, unlike savannas, trees are absent. We hypothesize that the lack of trees in grasslands is due to the scarcity of gaps suitable for tree seedling establishment in the grass root layer. We assessed which demographic bottlenecks, seedling recruitment or sapling release, were limiting large tree populations of Acacia species in 229 sites on a gradient from lowland savannas to upland grasslands in eastern South Africa. We explored the frequency of \xe2\x80\x98root gaps\xe2\x80\x99 by quantifying grass root biomass in grids of 18 points at six sites distributed from lowland savannas to upland grasslands.Across the altitudinal gradient, sapling release was the most common bottleneck at low elevation sites switching to seedling recruitment in upland savannas and adjacent grasslands. Root studies showed grass root biomass at upland sites to be double than that of lowland sites. When grass root biomass of all 108 sample points was ranked, lowland savanna sites had the most frequent \xe2\x80\x98gaps\xe2\x80\x99 defined as the lowest percentiles of values (5, 15, 25, 35, 45). The number of \xe2\x80\x98gaps\xe2\x80\x99 decreased along the elevation gradient with none in the grassland site. Dense grass roots may prevent seedling establishment and \xe2\x80\x98root gaps\xe2\x80\x99 may be safe sites with reduced competition where seedlings can establish. We suggest that a lack of root gaps could explain the treeless nature of many upland grasslands.'

The objective of this work evaluates in vitro antioxidant, antidiabetic, and antiinflammatory properties of hydroalcohol extract of bark of H. zeylanicum (HAHZ). It also describes isolation and structure determination of lucidenic acid A, which is the first report in this plant. In order to explain the role of antioxidant principles, DPPH, nitric oxide, hydroxyl, superoxide and metal chelating assays were performed. Antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory activities were investigated by quantifying \xce\xb1-amylase, \xce\xb1-glucosidase and protein denaturation inhibitory activities of HAHZ. Biochemical estimations were performed. The chemical structure of the triterpenoid was elucidated using 1H, 13C NMR and high resolution-MS.

The hepatoprotective effect of F. montana was evaluated against paracetamol induced hepatotoxicity in Wistar rats. Administration of paracetamol (2\xc2\xa0g/kg) showed a significant biochemical and histological deterioration in the liver of experimental animals. Pretreatment with F. montana (200 and 400\xc2\xa0mg/kg b.wt. p.o) significantly (P\xc2\xa0\xe2\xa9\xbd\xc2\xa00.001) reduced the elevated levels of serum enzymes like serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (AST), serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and reversed the hepatic damage in the liver which evidenced the hepatoprotective activity. The anti-inflammatory activity of F. montana was evaluated by carrageenan-induced paw edema and cotton pellet-induced granuloma models. F. montana (200 and 400\xc2\xa0mg/kg) showed a significant (P\xc2\xa0\xe2\xa9\xbd\xc2\xa00.001) reduction in rat paw edema with 76.39% and 80.32%, respectively induced by carrageenan against the reference anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen (10\xc2\xa0mg/kg) (83.10%).

Abstract: 'AbstractBackgroundIt is well known that diet plays a vital role in the pathogenesis, prevention, and management of diseases. In indigenous medical systems of India, diet is an integral component of treatment, and such knowledge is poorly documented. This study quantified the consensus about the dietary recommendations prescribed by the noninstitutionally trained Siddha practitioners of Virudhunagar District of Tamil Nadu, India.MethodsAfter obtaining prior informed consent, 87 noninstitutionally trained Siddha practitioners were interviewed using the free-list method. The data were segregated into different groups and the consensus was analyzed using informant consensus factor (Fic).ResultsIn the case of recommended diets, blood ailments, fever, hemorrhoids, male infertility, kapha, and dermatological ailments had high Fic values. In this group, 500 use-reports were recorded for the treatment of 27 illness categories. The fruits of Vitis vinifera (blood ailments), Panicum sumatrense (fever), and Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (hemorrhoids) were the highly recommended foods. In the case of restricted diets, dermatological ailments, jaundice, gastrointestinal, vadha, and blood ailments had high Fic values and 26 illness categories were reported with 368 citations. In this category, Solanum melongena (dermatological ailments), Tamarindus indica (jaundice and anemia), and Gallus gallus domesticus (gastrointestinal ailments) were the important restricted foods.ConclusionThe results of this study indicated that a major portion of local knowledge, other than that of local uses of medicinal species, is still undocumented and underutilized. If the recommendations of dietary changes take the claims from local knowledge beyond scientific evidence, the rate of adherence may increase, since these recommendations have a traditional-brand identity. This study also warrants the need of scientific analyses in some cases.'

Abstract: 'AbstractAim: To test the validity of sex discrimination using lateral cephalometric radiograph and discriminant function analysis in Indigenous (Kuruba) children and adolescents of Coorg, Karnataka, India. Methods and materials: Six hundred and sixteen lateral cephalograms of 380 male and 236 females of age ranging from 6.5 to 18\xc2\xa0years of Indigenous population of Coorg, Karnataka, India called Kurubas having a normal occlusion were included in the study. Lateral cephalograms were obtained in a standard position with teeth in centric occlusion and lips relaxed. Each radiograph was traced and cephalometric landmarks were measured using digital calliper. Calculations of 24 cephalometric measurements were performed. Results: Males exhibited significantly greater mean angular and linear cephalometric measurements as compared to females (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) (Table 5). Also, significant differences (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) were observed in all the variables according to age (Table 6). Out of 24 variables, only ULTc predicts the gender. The reliability of the derived discriminant function was assessed among study subjects; 100% of males and females were recognized correctly. Conclusion: The final outcome of this study validates the existence of sexual dimorphism in the skeleton as early as 6.5\xc2\xa0years of age. There is a need for further research to determine other landmarks that can help in sex determination and norms for Indigenous (Kuruba) population and also other Indigenous population of Coorg, Karnataka, India.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe coastal landforms along the south west coast of Kanyakumari have undergone remarkable change in terms of shape and disposition due to both natural and anthropogenic interference. An attempt is made here to map the coastal landforms along the coast using remote sensing and GIS techniques. Spatial data sources, such as, topographical map published by Survey of India, Landsat ETM+ (30\xc2\xa0m) image, IKONOS image (0.82\xc2\xa0m), SRTM and ASTER DEM datasets have been comprehensively analyzed for extracting coastal landforms. Change detection methods, such as, (i) topographical change detection, (ii) cross-shore profile analysis, (iii) Geomorphic Change Detection (GCD) using DEM of Difference (DoD) were adopted for assessment of volumetric changes of coastal landforms for the period between 2000 and 2011. The GCD analysis uses ASTER and SRTM DEM datasets by resampling them into common scale (pixel size) using pixel-by-pixel based Wavelet Transform and Pan-Sharpening techniques in ERDAS Imagine software. Volumetric changes of coastal landforms were validated with data derived from GPS-based field survey. Coastal landform units were mapped based on process of their evolution such as beach landforms including sandy beach, cusp, berm, scarp, beach terrace, upland, rockyshore, cliffs, wave-cut notches and wave-cut platforms; and the fluvial landforms. Comprising of alluvial plain, flood plains, and other shallow marshes in estuaries. The topographical change analysis reveals that the beach landforms have reduced their elevation ranging from 1 to 3\xc2\xa0m probably due to sediment removal or flattening. Analysis of cross-shore profiles for twelve locations indicate varying degrees of loss or gain of coastal landforms. For example, the K3-K3\xe2\x80\xb2 profile across the Kovalam coast has shown significant erosion (\xe2\x88\x920.26 to \xe2\x88\x920.76\xc2\xa0m) of the sandy beaches resulting in the formation of beach cusps and beach scarps within a distance of 300\xc2\xa0m from the shoreline. The volumetric change of sediment load estimated based on DoD model depict a loss of 241.69\xc2\xa0m3/km2 for 62.82\xc2\xa0km2 of the area and land gain of 6.96\xc2\xa0m3/km2 for 202.80\xc2\xa0km2 of the area during 2000\xe2\x80\x932011. However, an area of 26.38\xc2\xa0km2 unchanged by maintaining equilibrium in sediment budgeting along the coastal stretch. The study apart from providing insight into the decadal change of coastal settings also supplements a database on the vulnerability of the coast, which would help the coastal managers in future.'

The complete mitogenome is a circular molecule of 15,575\xc2\xa0bp length, consisting of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA genes (rrnS and rrnL), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and an A\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0T-rich region (D-loop). The nucleotide composition of the genome is highly A\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0T biased, accounting for 80.67% of nucleotides. All tRNAs have putative secondary structures that are characteristic of mitochondrial tRNA. Most of the PCGs were initiated by typical ATN codons. Five genes were initiated by unusual codons. Cox1 gene was initiated by an unusual CGA codon and terminated by the typical stop codon GAA. Six genes ended with a single T. The A\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0T-rich region of 336\xc2\xa0bp consisted of repetitive sequences, including two ATAGA motifs, a 19\xc2\xa0bp poly-T stretch and three microsatellite-like regions ((TA)4, (TA)6 and two (TA)7). Moreover, three large tandem (one 40\xc2\xa0bp and two 25\xc2\xa0bp) repeated elements were identified in A\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0T-rich region. Phylogenetic analysis using PCGs revealed that Superfamily Noctuoidea is a monophyletic group.'

Collected RW samples were analyzed for major chemical constituents (F\xe2\x88\x92, Cl\xe2\x88\x92, SO42\xe2\x88\x92, NO3\xe2\x88\x92, NH4+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+), pH and conductivity. In addition, bicarbonate (HCO3\xe2\x88\x92) was also estimated. The mean pH values of the RW were >6\xc2\xa0at Pune and <6\xc2\xa0at Delhi and 4% and 26% were acidic, respectively. The mean sum of all measured ionic species in Pune and Delhi was 304.7 and 536.4\xc2\xa0\xce\xbceq/l, respectively, indicating that significant atmospheric pollution effects in these Indian mega cities. Both the Ca2+ and SO42\xe2\x88\x92 were the dominant ions, accounting for 43% (Pune) and 54% (Delhi) of the total ions. The sum of measured ions during the NMN period was greater than the NM period by a factor of 1.5 for Pune (278.4: NM and 412.1: NMN \xce\xbceq/l) and a factor of about 2.5 for Delhi (406 and 1037.7\xc2\xa0\xce\xbceq/l).

The concentrations of secondary aerosols (SO42\xe2\x88\x92and NO3\xe2\x88\x92) were higher by a factor of two and three when the air masses were transported to Pune from the continental side. At Delhi, the concentrations of SO42\xe2\x88\x92, NO3\xe2\x88\x92, Ca2+, and Mg2+ were significantly higher when the air masses arrive from Punjab, Haryana, and Pakistan indicating the greater atmospheric pollution over the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Positive matrix factorization was applied to the source apportionment of the deposition fluxes of these ions. Three factors were obtained for Pune and four for Delhi. The sources at Pune were secondary aerosols from fossil fuel combustion, soil dust, and marine, whereas, at Delhi, the sources were soil, fossil fuel combustion, biomass burning, and industrial chlorine.'

Abstract: 'AbstractDelineation of groundwater prospect zones has been carried out using RS and GIS for Melattur Grama Panchayat in Malappuram district of Kerala. The spatial and non spatial database on various terrain features were generated using RS imageries, SOI toposheets, etc. Groundwater prospect zones were delineated through the integration of the reclassified raster map layers of geomorphology, slope percent, drainage buffer, geology, landuse/land cover and soil texture using the weighted overlay analysis in Arc-GIS.

Title: 'Basalt- CO2\xe2\x80\x93H2O interactions and variability in carbonate mineralization rates'
Author: 'H.T.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610209009631
Abstract: 'AbstractFlood basalts are receiving increasing attention as possible host formations for geologic sequestration of anthropogenic CO2, with studies underway in the U.S., India, Iceland, and Canada. Our previous laboratory studies with Columbia River basalts showed relative quick precipitation of carbonate minerals compared to other siliclastic rocks when batch reacted with water and supercritical CO2. In this study, our prior work with Columbia River basalt was extended to tests with basalts from the eastern U.S., India, and Africa. The basalts are all similar in bulk chemistry and share common minerals such as plagioclase, augite, and a glassy mesostasis. Single pass flow through dissolution experiments under dilute solution and mildly acidic conditions indicate similar cation release behavior among the basalt samples tested. Despite similar bulk chemistry and apparent dissolution kinetics, long-term static experiments with CO2 saturated water show significant differences in rates of mineralization as well as precipitate chemistry and morphology. For example, basalt from the Newark Basin in the U.S. is by far the most reactive of any basalt tested to date. Carbonate reaction products for the Newark Basin basalt were globular in form and contained significantly more Fe than the secondary carbonates that precipitated on the other basalt samples. Calcite grains with classic \xe2\x80\x9cdogtooth spar\xe2\x80\x9d morphology and trace cation substitution (Mg and Mn) were observed in post-reacted samples associated with the Columbia River basalts. Other basalts produced solid precipitates with compositions that varied chemically throughout the entire testing period. Polished cross sections of the reacted grains show precipitate overgrowths with irregular regions outlined by dark and bright layers indicative of zonations of different compositions. Chemical differences in the precipitates indicate changes in fluid chemistry unique to the dissolution The Karoo basalt appeared the least reactive, with very limited behavior of each basalt sample reacted with CO2 saturated water. mineralization occurring during the testing period. Additional experiments conducted using mixtures of H2S and CO2 unexpectedly changed the relative reactivity of the basalts. For example, the Karoo basalt was highly reactive in the presence of aqueous dissolved H2S and CO2, evident by small nodules of carbonate coating the basalt grains after 181 days of testing. However the most reactive basalt in pure CO2, Newark Basin, formed limited amounts of carbonate in the presence of H2S. Basalt reactivity in pure CO2 appears to be controlled by the glassy mesostasis chemistry, which is the most reactive component of basalt. With the addition of H2S, the reactivity appears to be controlled by precipitation of insoluble iron sulfides as coatings on the basalt grains.'

The average seasonal profiles show highest mixing ratios at 900\xc2\xa0hPa in the boreal winter and lowest in the Indian summer monsoon over all the study regions. We observe a slight increase in CO levels from 500\xc2\xa0hPa to 200\xc2\xa0hPa over all the locations. The CO mixing ratios are found to be higher by about 10\xe2\x80\x9340% around 300\xe2\x80\x93200\xc2\xa0hPa as compared to 900\xc2\xa0hPa over Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Trivandrum during monsoon period. This could be due to lifting of polluted air by convection and getting trapped in the anticyclonic winds over the Indian region during the monsoon. Most of the 7\xc2\xa0day back trajectories over these regions show transport of the polluted air mass from the major biomass burning regions of central Africa and SE Asia. The results show dominance of the seasonal amplitude at 900\xc2\xa0hPa over all the regions, while inter-annual variability dominates mostly over Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Trivandrum at 300\xc2\xa0hPa. In order to check the ability of different models in capturing the observed variability, the results have been compared with simulations from two chemistry transport models (MOZART and EMAC). This comparison shows that both the models perform reasonably well in simulating the basic features such as annual variation as well as increase in CO around 300\xe2\x80\x93200\xc2\xa0hPa due to convection during the monsoon season.'

Abstract: 'AbstractBackgroundCadmium (Cd), a nonessential heavy metal, is a major environmental and public health concern. Oxidative stress plays an important role in Cd-induced kidney dysfunction. Tinospora cordifolia, a medicinal plant rich in phytochemicals, possesses antioxidant activity. The objective of the present study was to assess the protective effect of Tinospora cordifolia-stem methanolic extract (TCE) on Cd-induced nephrotoxicity in Wistar rats.MethodsMale Wistar rats were administered \xe2\x88\xbc5\xc2\xa0mg/kg body weight Cd orally and 100\xc2\xa0mg/kg body weight TCE for 28 days. At the end of Cd and TCE treatment, biochemical assays were performed in serum and tissue homogenate.ResultsCd-induced oxidative stress in the kidney resulted in increased levels of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl content with a significant decrease in cellular antioxidants, such as reduced GSH, SOD, CAT, GPX, and GST. Cd-induced nephrotoxicity was further confirmed by marked changes in the histology of the kidney and increased levels of kidney markers. Additionally, Cd-treated rats showed alterations in membrane-bound ATPase activity and decreased levels of tissue glycoproteins. Cotreatment with TCE considerably reduced the biochemical alterations in serum and renal tissue induced by Cd, and also restored ATPase activity and glycoproteins to near normal levels.ConclusionOur results suggested that TCE with its antioxidant effect offered cytoprotection against Cd-induced toxicity in kidneys by restoring the altered cellular antioxidants and renal markers. TCE treatment for 28 days reversed ATPase activity and tissue glycoprotein levels. These results revealed the protective effect of TCE on Cd-induced toxicity in kidneys and oxidative stress.'

Abstract: "AbstractDrought is a significant natural disaster which leads to food, fodder and water shortages along with destruction of vital ecological system. Drought is acknowledged as a phenomenon associated with scarcity of water due to reduction in the amount of precipitation over an extended period of time, usually a season, a year or more in length. Droughts are frequently occurring in Upper Krishna basin in Maharashtra where about 80 percent of agriculture land is rain fed. Also this region is witnessing rapid urbanization due to industrial growth where thirst for water for drinking as well as industrial use is demanding. The study of drought trends is extremely important as it is related with food security and management of scarce water resource, which becomes critical in case of drought events. In this work, the drought trend of Standardized precipitation index (SPI) at 1-, 6-, 12-, 24- and 48- month time scales, Percent of Normal Precipitation (PNP) at Annual and Water-Year time scales and Seasonal rainfall (winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon and post monsoon time scales) are computed using long time series (1960-2012) of monthly precipitation data at 59 stations in the study area. The statistical significance at 95% confidence level as per Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator are used for drought trend analysis over the Upper Krishna basin in Maharashtra. The PNP drought trend analysis at both annual and water-year time scale is able to detect significant trend at only 5 stations out of all rain gauge stations, SPI based drought trend analysis is found to be more sensitive to multiple time scales. As the SPI-1 time scale is able to detect significant trend at only 4 stations, number of stations having significant trend increases as the SPI time scale increases up to SPI-48 at 50 stations. Drought trend of Seasonal rainfall time series vary as per the classes. Pre-monsoon time scale detects significant negative trend at 41 stations with no significant positive trend at any of the stations. Monsoon time scale detects only 2 positive and 1 negative significant trends at total stations. Post-monsoon time scale is not able to detect any significant trend at all stations. The results indicate that, there is negative trend of pre-monsoon rainfall at over 63 percent of area. SPI- 48 time scale is able to detect significant trend at over 84 percent of area. This analysis may help to solve problems associated with floods, droughts and allocation of water for agriculture, industry, hydro-power generation, domestic and industrial use."

The activity concentration of artificially produced radionuclide 137Cs was BDL to 12.34\xc2\xa0Bqkg\xe2\x88\x921 in the soil and it was below detectable level (BDL) in all the plant samples. The soil to plant transfer factors (TF) varied from 0.07 to 0.27, BDL to 0.80, 0.04 to 0.13 and 0.17 to 23.80, respectively, for 226Ra, 210Pb, 232Th, and 40K. The AACED due to the ingestion of radionuclides from the medicinal plants varied from 0.0075 to 0.1067\xc2\xa0mSvy\xe2\x88\x921. The AACED values reported in this study are much below the world average value of 0.30\xc2\xa0mSvy\xe2\x88\x921 for an individual. This indicates that there is no radiological health risk in using these plants for medicinal purposes. This study may also contribute data on local medicinal plants to formulate regulations related to radiological healthcare.'

Title: 'ArticleIdentification of Taxol-producing endophytic fungi isolated from Salacia oblonga through genomic mining approach'
Author: 'G.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe most promising anti-tumor agent developed in the past three decades is Taxol. It is proven to be effective against many cancers. It is necessary to isolate pharmacologically potent endophytic microbial strains from medicinal plants with special reference to Taxol production. In the current study, endophytic fungi were isolated from the bark of the medicinal plant, Salacia oblonga. The isolated endophytes were identified morphologically, and further characterized by ITS-PCR using genomic DNA samples, later the products were sequenced for identification and phylogenetic linkage mapping. The samples were screened for the potential to produce Taxol or taxanes, employing PCR. The resulted data have been sequenced to confirm the presence of the two genes implicated in Taxol biosynthesis, 10-deacetylbaccatin III-10-O-acetyl transferase (DBAT) and C-13 phenylpropanoid side chain-CoA acyltransferase (BAPT). Seven samples showed the amplicons of DBAT gene and one showed the amplicons of BAPT gene. Sequencing of these products was carried out, of which one sample has revealed sequence homology to the original DBAT gene from Taxus. The present work confirms and substantiates the potential of genomic mining approach to discover novel Taxol-producing endophytic fungi.'

Abstract: 'AbstractTo reduce the human influence on natural resources and to identify an appropriate land use, it is essential to carry out scientific land evaluations. Such kind of analysis allows identifying the main limiting factors for the agricultural production and enables decision makers to develop crop managements able to increase the land productivity. Objectives of this study were to develop a GIS based approach for land use suitability assessment which will assist land managers and land use planners to identify areas with physical constraints for a range of nominated land uses. Georeferenced soil survey data and field work observations have been integrated in a GIS based land use suitability assessment for agricultural planning in Chamarajanagar district, Karnataka, India. Also, GIS has been used to match the suitability for main crops based on the requirements of the crops and the quality and characteristics of land. Different land quality parameters, viz. soil texture, depth, erosion, slope, flooding and coarse fragments under various land units were evaluated for the crops. Subsequently all of them were integrated using a sequence of logical operations to generate land suitability and capability maps. Suitability and capability maps for each land use were developed to illustrate these suitability degrees and display the spatial representation of soils suitable for agriculture. It was also found that better land use options could be implemented in different land units as the conventional land evaluation methods suffer from limitation of spatial analysis for the suitability of various crops.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIndeed, the development of alternate fuels for use in internal combustion engines has traditionally been an evolutionary process in which fuel-related problems are met and critical fuel properties are identified and their specific limits defined to resolve the problem. In this regard, this research outlines a vision of lemongrass oil combustion characteristics. In a nut-shell, the combustion phenomena of lemongrass oil were investigated at engine speed of 1500\xc2\xa0rpm and compression ratio of 17.5 in a 4-stroke cycle compression ignition engine. Furthermore, the engine tests were conducted with partial premixed charge compression ignition-direct injection (PCCI-DI) dual fuel system to profoundly address the combustion phenomena. Analysis of cylinder pressure data and heat-release analysis of neat and premixed lemongrass oil were demonstrated in-detail and compared with conventional diesel. The experimental outcomes disclosed that successful ignition and energy release trends can be obtained from a compression ignition engine fueled with lemongrass oil.'

Abstract: 'AbstractZircon from quartzites in the contact aureole and wider environs of the Kadavur anorthosite complex, SE India, was studied by laser ablation ICP-MS to assess the response of the U\xe2\x80\x93Pb isotope system and trace element concentrations to ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) contact metamorphism (\xe2\x89\xa5\xc2\xa01000\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C). Combined cathodoluminescence imaging and LA-ICP-MS analyses show that zircon grains contain detrital cores, which yield ages between 3.4\xc2\xa0Ga and 1.8\xc2\xa0Ga and exhibit a large spread in REE concentrations. These cores are associated with one or two rims that provide concordant age populations at 955\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa016\xc2\xa0Ma and 810\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa07\xc2\xa0Ma (2\xcf\x83) and relatively uniform REE patterns. The older ages of ca. 955\xc2\xa0Ma record the imprints of regional early Neoproterozoic metamorphism related to Rodinia assembly. The younger age is interpreted to date anorthosite emplacement and its associated contact metamorphism during a second regional metamorphic episode, coeval with the intrusion of A-type granites in the area. Zircon grains from the country rocks away from the anorthosite show additional rims yielding ages from 590 to 490\xc2\xa0Ma corresponding to regional Pan-African tectonometamorphism.The zircon rims are either newly grown domains or represent recrystallized and re-equilibrated parts of precursor zircon. Discordance is only observed in 25% of the detrital cores. These cores have relatively high U concentrations (>\xc2\xa0400\xc2\xa0ppm), which strongly suggests that Pb loss occurred under (U)HT conditions by partial recrystallization (annealing) of zircon that had become metamict. The preservation of old concordant ages and source REE characteristics by the low-U (i.e., weakly to non metamict) detrital cores shows that pristine zircon is extremely robust to thermal disturbance and that its U\xe2\x80\x93Pb systematics can remain unaffected despite multiple (U)HT metamorphic episodes. These observations imply that U\xe2\x80\x93Pb ages in zircon cannot be reset by volume diffusion under any crustal conditions. Disturbance of the U\xe2\x80\x93Pb system in individual zircon crystals or parts thereof can only be achieved by recrystallization of radiation damaged zircon.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba U\xe2\x80\x93Pb system and REE abundances in zircon are robust even during (U)HT metamorphism. \xe2\x96\xba Metamictization of zircon controls recrystallization during metamorphism. \xe2\x96\xba Regional metamorphism in Kadavur (S India) at ca. 955\xc2\xa0Ma, 810\xc2\xa0Ma and 590\xe2\x80\x93490\xc2\xa0Ma. \xe2\x96\xba Metamorphism at ca. 810\xc2\xa0Ma was associated with anorthosite intrusion.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Hyetograph change gives nonlinear flood responses without overland flow activation.\xe2\x80\xa2New storm intensity - hydrograph relationship apparent from diverse synoptic regimes.\xe2\x80\xa2Implications for improved flood simulation under time-varying rainfall intensity regimes.AbstractIntense rainstorms are a prevalent feature of current weather. Evidence is presented showing that simulation of flood hydrographs shown to be dominated by subsurface flow requires watershed model parameterisation to vary between periods of different rainstorm intensity, in addition to varying with antecedent basin storage. The data show an emerging global relation between flood response and the intensity of rainstorms. Flood responses are quantified as watershed residence times (strictly time constants of nonlinear transfer-function models) identified directly from information contained within 15-min rainfall and streamflow observations. The emerging monotonic, curvilinear relation indicates that (subsurface) watershed residence time decreases as mean intensity rises, and is seen over a wide range of synoptic conditions from temperate and tropical climates. Projected increases in rainstorm intensity would then result in a greater likelihood of river floods in subsurface-dominated watersheds than is currently simulated by systems models omitting this additional nonlinearity.'

Abstract: 'AbstractVarious developmental projects have come up in the coastal zone of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts in the last few decades. A number of beaches are subjected to erosion and lots of coastal properties are destroyed specially during SW monsoon season along the Mangalore coast in recent years. In order to protect the beaches and the properties, a number of seawalls - each ranging in length between 100 m and 2500 m - are built since 1980s. A very few of them built scientifically, but most of them are just dumping of granite blocks directly on the shoreline. In the present study, an attempt is made to understand long-term (1967-2013) shoreline changes as well as erosion / deposition patterns due to natural (including sea-level rise) and anthropogenic activities along this coast. The study area extends from Yermal in the north to Talpady in the south covering a total length of 45.63\xc2\xa0km. Topomap of 1967 and multi-temporal satellite images have been analyzed using Remote Sensing and GIS techniques to demarcate shoreline positions and to assess the impact of anthropogenic and hydrological factors on coastal morphology of this region. An integrative approach of Remote Sensing and GIS techniques as well as seasonal field studies clearly illustrates the reasons for shoreline and beach morphological changes. Construction of seawalls has resulted in shifting of erosion sites from one place to another adjacent place, whereas, breakwaters have been acting as barriers for littoral drift. Overall, areas subjected to erosion are higher compared to those subjected to accretion in the study area. Applications of Remote Sensing and GIS have led to understanding shoreline and beach morphological changes. These have also provided data analysis tools and methods to evaluate the geospatial patterns in short-term and long-term changes. The results of this study will be useful for shoreline, coastal zone management and implementation of CRZ act.'

Abstract: "AbstractStudy regionThe study is carried out for Mumbai (18\xc2\xb058\xe2\x80\xb230\xe2\x80\xb3 N, 72\xc2\xb049\xe2\x80\xb233\xe2\x80\xb3 E).Study focusFuture projections provided by general circulation models (GCMs) suggest the probability of occurrence of intense rainfall will change in the future. However, GCM data generally need to be downscaled and bias-corrected for impact studies. Although the domains covered by Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are increasing, statistical downscaling of GCM results is the main alternative in many regions. We applied a Distribution-based Scaling (DBS) procedure, with 1975\xe2\x80\x932004 as a reference period, for bias-correcting and downscaling daily rainfall data from nine global climate projections.New hydrological insights for the regionThe evaluation in the reference period showed that the scaled data are able to represent various key statistics. All GCMs were unable to accurately reproduce the southwest monsoon season. Using the transient DBS processed projection data, a comprehensive evaluation of key rainfall statistics was performed for three periods: near (2010\xe2\x80\x932040), intermediate (2041\xe2\x80\x932070) and distant future (2071\xe2\x80\x932099). There is an increase in the total accumulated annual rainfall, ranging from 300 to 500\xc2\xa0mm in the ensemble. Also, a clear seasonal shift and delayed onset of the monsoon season evolves in the projections, with increasing and decreasing rainfall in September and June, respectively. A trend analysis using Student's t and Mann\xe2\x80\x93Kendall tests was performed for 2010\xe2\x80\x932099. A significant positive trend was found for four of the GCM projections."

Title: 'Forecasting One Day Ahead Stream Flow Using Support Vector Regression\xe2\x98\x86'

Abstract: 'AbstractEffective stream flow forecast for different lead-times is useful in water resource management in arid regions, in designing of hydraulic structures and almost all water resources related issues. The Support Vector Machines are learning systems that use a hypothetical space of linear functions in a kernel induced higher dimensional feature space, and are trained with a learning algorithm from optimization theory. Support vector machines are the methods of supervised learning, which are commonly used for classification and regression purpose. A SVM constructs a separating hyper plane between the classes in the n-dimensional space of the inputs. The Support Vector Regression attempts to fit a curve with respect to the kernel used in SVM on data points such that the points lie between two marginal hyper planes which helps in minimizing the regression error. For non-linear regression problems Kernel functions are used to map the data into higher dimensional space where linear regression is performed. The current paper presents use of a data driven technique of Support Vector Regression (SVR) to forecast stream flow one day ahead at two stations in India, namely Nighoje in Krishna river basin and another station is Mandaleshwar in Narmada river basin. For forecasting stream flow one day in advance previous values of measured stream flow and rainfall were used for building the models. The relevant inputs were fixed on the basis of autocorrelation, Cross-correlation and trial and error. The model results were reasonable as evident from low value of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) accompanied by scatter plots and hydrographs.'

Abstract: 'AbstractHigh population pressure and the rapid pace of human activity including urbanization, industrialization and other economic activities have led to a dwindling supply of arable land per capita as well as water, especially ground water in underdeveloped countries. This has entailed considerable damage to the physical environment, including degradation and depletion of natural resources and unsustainable use of land and water resources. With the impact of climate change, the depletion of water resources will be faster both at the ground as well as the surface level due to rising temperatures in the region. This paper underscores the need for an eclectic approach to policy responses stemming from private and common property rights theories, externality theory and sustainability theory with a view to managing groundwater availability for the poor in terms of equity and sustainability in South Asia, China and Africa.'

Abstract: 'AbstractOne of the risks to threaten mountainous areas is that hillslope instability caused damage to lands. One of the most dangerous instabilities is mass movement and much movement occurs due to slip. The aim of this study is zonation of landslide hazards in a basin of the Ardebil province, the eastern slopes of Sabalan, Iran. Geological and geomorphologic conditions, climate and type of land use have caused susceptibility of this watershed to landslides. Firstly, maps of the main factors affecting landslide occurrence including slope, distance from faults, lithology, elevation and precipitation were prepared and digitized. Then, by using interpretation of aerial photos and satellite images and field views, the ground truth map of landslides was prepared. Each basic layer (factor) and landslide map were integrated to compute the numeric value of each factor with the help of a Landslide Numerical Risk Factor (LNRF) model and landslide occurrence percent obtained in different units from each of the maps. Finally, with overlapping different data layers, a landslide hazard zonation map was prepared. Results showed that 67.85% of the basin has high instability, 7.76% moderate instability and 24.39% low instability.'

Abstract: 'AbstractPhosphate fertilizers are enriched with 238U during its production from phosphate rocks. Since, application of phosphate fertilizers in modern agriculture is ever on the increase, the present study investigated the impact of phosphate fertilizers on the radioactivity profile of cultivated (fertilized) soils as against virgin soils. Thirty soil samples each from cultivated fields and virgin fields were collected from Srirangam taluk and analyzed for the activity concentrations of 238U, 232Th and 40K employing gamma ray spectrometry. Similar analysis was also undertaken in commonly used phosphate fertilizers. Among the phosphate fertilizers analyzed single super phosphate (396.3\xc2\xa0Bq/kg) and triple super phosphate (284.2\xc2\xa0Bq/kg) registered higher level of 238U. The mean activity level of 238U in cultivated soil (8.4\xc2\xa0Bq/kg) was 25% higher than that of virgin soil (6.8\xc2\xa0Bq/kg), while the mean 232Th and 40K activities in cultivated soil (98.4\xc2\xa0Bq/kg & 436\xc2\xa0Bq/kg) were elevated by 12.4% and 4% respectively as compared to virgin soil (87.5\xc2\xa0Bq/kg & 419\xc2\xa0Bq/kg). The mean radium equivalent (Raeq) value for virgin and cultivated soil samples was found to be 164.5\xc2\xa0Bq/kg and 181.7\xc2\xa0Bq/kg respectively. It is evident that the application of phosphate fertilizers elevated 238U level of the soil. However, the mean Raeq value for soil samples is well below the permissible limit of 370\xc2\xa0Bq/kg and hence cultivated soils do not pose any radiological risk.'

During the study period, we observed 48 bird species of which 47 species are residents to Sri Lanka. The avian species richness, evenness, and heterogeneity were found to be the highest at undisturbed habitats. Further, these diversity measures were negatively correlated with the intensity of anthropogenic land-use activities. Total abundance of birds increased at highly disturbed habitats due to the presence of the house crow, as it is the most abundant of all birds observed at these habitats. This study highlights the need for habitat management around estuaries, giving due consideration to existing ecological theories to conserve avifaunal diversity. It also highlights the negative impacts of the house crow on diversity of other resident avian fauna in these habitats.'

Title: 'Archaeobotanical implications of phytolith assemblages from cultivated rice systems, wild rice stands and macro-regional patterns\xe2\x98\x86'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We present a new methodology for identifying ancient rice arable systems.\xe2\x80\xa2We create modern analogues of phytolith assemblages of rice weeds from modern fields.\xe2\x80\xa2These analogues are used as models to understand archaeobotanical samples.\xe2\x80\xa2We present an analysis of different systems from Neolithic India and China.AbstractRice can be cultivated in a range of arable systems, including upland rainfed, lowland rainfed or irrigated, flooded or d\xc3\xa9crue, and deep water cultivation. These agricultural regimes represent ecosystems controlled to large degree by agricultural practices, and can be shown to produce different weed flora assemblages. In order to reconstruct early rice cultivation systems it is necessary to better establish how ancient rice farming practices may be seen using archaeobotanical data. This paper focuses on using modern analogue phytolith assemblages of associated crop weeds found within cultivation regimes, as well as in wild rice stands (unplanted stands of Oryza nivara or Oryza rufipogon), as a means of interpreting archaeobotanical assemblages. Rice weeds and sediment samples have been recorded and collected from a range of arable systems and wild stands in India. The husks, leaves and culms of associated weeds were processed for phytolith reference samples, and sediment samples were processed for phytoliths in order to establish patterns identifiable to specific systems. The preliminary results of the phytolith analysis of samples from these modern fields demonstrate that phytolith assemblage statistics show correlation with variation in rice cultivation systems on the basis of differences in environmental conditions and regimes, with wetness being one major factor. Analysis of phytoliths from archaeological samples from contrasting systems in Neolithic China and India demonstrate how this method can be applied to separate archaeological regions and periods based on inferred differences in past agricultural practices, identifying wet cultivation systems in China, dry millet-dominated agriculture of north China and rainfed/dry rice in Neolithic India.'

Abstract: 'AbstractPlants with potential therapeutic values have been used from time immemorial to cure various ailments and infectious diseases. Of late, scientific evidences have been provided on the potential therapeutic agent exhibited by certain traditionally used vegetable extracts. The importance of wild edible plants may be traced to antiquity but systemic studies are recent. All the Momordica species have been consumed as vegetable and traditionally used for various disorders. The whole plant parts are ascribed to possess the anti-diabetic effect in traditional medicinal system. The active constituents of Momordica plant parts were cucurbitane type triterpenoids, phenolics, glycosides, and several kinds of peptides including Momordica anti-HIV protein (MAP 30). Recent reports revealed the presence of several kinds of cucurbitane type triterpenoids in leaf, stem and fruits of Momordica species having several pharmacological activities. There is lack of scientific information available on the wild species which also having several bioactive components with potential activities. So the present review compares and highlights the current knowledge of the nutritional value, phytochemistry and physiological effects of wild species with known variety.'

Abstract: 'AbstractPreliminary phytochemical screening was carried out for methanolic extracts of Pterolobium hexapetalum (PH) and Celosia argentea (CA). Methanolic extracts of PH and CA were studied as corrosion inhibitors for mild steel in industrial water medium using mass loss and electrochemical techniques. The adsorption of both PH and CA extracts on mild steel surface followed Langmuir isotherm. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements showed that the charge transfer resistance increases with increasing concentration of extracts. Various thermodynamic parameters were evaluated and discussed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the surface adsorbed film. Further, antioxidant activity of the plant extracts was determined and correlated with the results obtained with inhibition efficiency.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIt is quite impossible to travel far in India without observing the remarkable ferruginous crust to which Buchanan in 1807 gave the name of laterite. In Indian peninsula, it is a post-Cretaceous stratigraphic succession with a polycyclic nature of evolution which marks the unconformity with recent Quaternary alluvium. There are perennial problems and research gaps in the investigation of laterites in India as well as in West Bengal: (1) defining, identifying and classifying lateritic materials, (2) mode of formation of laterite and its other horizons, (3) determining the ages of laterites, (4) reliability of laterites as palaeoclimatic indicators, (5) identifying topographic requirements and pedogeomorphic processes for laterite formation, and (6) reconstructions of former lateritized landscapes. The formation of north\xe2\x80\x92south lateritic hard crust (i.e. Rarh Bengal) on the Rajmahal Basalt Traps, Archean granite\xe2\x80\x92gneiss, Gondwana sediments, Paleogene gravels and older deltaic alluvium is analyzed here to resolve the aforesaid problems and to depict the variable characteristics of laterites with special reference to its tectono-climatic evolution in the northwestern marginal part of Bengal Basin. This paper reveals that the low-level secondary laterites (probably the Pliocene\xe2\x80\x92Early Pleistocene age) of Rarh Bengal are composed of heterogeneous Fe\xe2\x80\x92Al rich gravelly materials which were derived from the high-level primary laterites (probably the Eocene\xe2\x80\x92Miocene age) of plateau since the Paleogene Period by the peninsular river system, following the underlying structure of Bengal Basin. Alongside the roles of drifting of Indian Plate, establishment of monsoon climate, neo-tectonic uplifts and re-lateritization of ferruginous shelf deposits are determined here to unearth the palaeogenesis of primary and secondary laterites in West Bengal.'

Abstract: 'AbstractFlood is a natural demolishing phenomenon, forecast of which is of high importance, to reduce its impact. On the other hand, it also serves as a major source of water when conserved through proper means. For this purpose, estimation of flood is of at utmost importance. The present study employed regression analysis between weighted maximum rainfall and maximum stream flow for the flood events of respective catchments of Vellar river basin. Regression equation was framed between Annual Maximum Daily Rainfall, Stream Flow and area for each catchment. Based on the equation, flood prioritization rank was given to each of the catchment. Thereby, Lower Vellar is prioritized as first rank and Upper Vellar is prioritized as last rank respectively. This study reveals that the Lower Vellar is the most vulnerable catchment and which needs flood control measures.'

Abstract: "AbstractIndustrialization and urbanization are mainly responsible for the conversion of significant amount of vegetation rich lands such as forests and wetlands into agricultural lands and human settlements. This land use and land cover change in turn has influence on various hydrological processes such as soil erosion rate, sediment deposition in rivers and dams and also stream flow pattern in a catchment. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of Land use and Land cover (LU/LC) changes is necessary to assess the impacts of change in the pattern of natural vegetation on the earth's environment. Satellite images can provide useful information regarding spatial and temporal variation of LU/LC in an area. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the dynamics of LU/LC changes using LISS-III data for the years 2007, 2010 and 2013 of Harangi catchment, Coorg District, Karnataka State, India. Also, study compares three classification techniques such as Parallelepiped Algorithm, Minimum Distance to Mean Algorithm and Maximum Likelihood Algorithm based on the value of overall accuracy and kappa coefficient to check the reliability of the methods in classifying images. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient obtained by using Parellelepiped, Minimum distance to mean and Maximum likelihood algorithm for the year 2013 are 81.47% & 0.71, 78.67 & 0.68 and 89.36% & 0.81 respectively. Based on these results, it can be concluded that, among all the three techniques, the Maximum Likelihood Algorithm gave higher accuracy with high kappa coefficient and Minimum Distance to Mean Algorithm gave lower accuracy. The LU/LC change detection results between years 2007 and 2013 indicated a drastic change in forest area, plantation and waste land among all other classes. The forest area decreased dramatically from 183.12 sq. km to 131.02 sq. km. Also, fallow land and water body are decreased from 68.89 sq. km to 42.63 sq. km and 6.71 sq. km to 3.82 sq. km respectively. In contrast, the plantation and waterlogged area are observed to have an increasing trend of about 56.07 sq. km to 146.55 sq. km and 17.99 sq. km to 23.81 sq. km. The urban area has been increased from 13.06 sq. km to 13.72 sq. km. The urbanization and agricultural activities are the major reasons for increase in plantation and urban area in an expense of decrease in forest area."

Abstract: 'AbstractGridded rainfall data of 0.5\xc3\x970.5\xc2\xb0 resolution (CRU TS 3.21) was analysed to study long term spatial and temporal trends on annual and seasonal scales in Wainganga river basin located in Central India during 1901\xe2\x80\x932012. After testing the presence of autocorrelation, Mann\xe2\x80\x93Kendall (Modified Mann\xe2\x80\x93Kendall) test was applied to non-auto correlated (auto correlated) series to detect the trends in rainfall data. Theil and Sen\xd7\xb3s slope estimator test was used for finding the magnitude of change over a time period. For detecting the most probable change year, Pettitt\xe2\x80\x93Mann\xe2\x80\x93Whitney test was applied. The Rainfall series was then divided into two partial duration series for finding changes in trends before and after the change year. Arc GIS was used to explore spatial patterns of the trends over the entire basin. Though most of the grid points shows a decreasing trend in annual rainfall, only seven grids has a significant decreasing trend during 1901\xe2\x80\x932012. On the basis of seasonal trend analysis, non-significant increasing trend is observed only in post monsoon season while seven grid points show significant decreasing trend in monsoon rainfall and non-significant in pre-monsoon and winter rainfall over the last 112 years. During the study period, overall a 8.45% decrease in annual rainfall is estimated. The most probable year of change was found to be 1948 in annual and monsoonal rainfall. There is an increasing rainfall trend in the basin during the period 1901\xe2\x80\x931948, which is reversed during the period 1949\xe2\x80\x932012 resulting in decreasing rainfall trend in the basin.

Abstract: 'AbstractUnderstanding carbon stocks relative to tree species is important for managing tropical forests in a way that will result in the carbon emission reductions and biodiversity conservation required under the REDD+\xc2\xa0scheme. Here we analyse inventory data from 179 sample plots in semi-evergreen forests of three provinces in Cambodia. Across all study sites, 5,995 trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) \xe2\x89\xa510\xc2\xa0cm, comprising 79 species from 38 families, were analysed. Tree species of the Dipterocarpaceae were most common (10 species), followed by the species of Caesalpinaceae, Combretaceae and Ebenaceae. Analysis of relative carbon stocks (RCS) suggested that Lagerstroemia calyculata Kurz (RCS=14.3%), Syzygium sp. (6.8%), Shorea vulgaris (5.0%), Irvingia malayana (4.8%), Anisoptera costata Kort (4.6%), Vatica astrotricha (4.2%), and Dehaasia cuneata Blume (3.8%) together accounted for 43.6% of the total average carbon stocks of 99.8\xc2\xb14.8\xc2\xa0MgC\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. We found that carbon stock is highly correlated to basal area (R2=0.993) but not to stem density (R2=0.153). Using carbon stock values, we estimated the carbon emission due to deforestation of semi-evergreen forests to be 8.3\xc2\xa0TgCO2 \xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 in Cambodia between 2002 and 2010. These emissions and the loss of 79 tree species in our study sites could be avoided if financial incentives were available for protecting semi-evergreen forests in Cambodia.'

The most recent knowledge on seismic activity in the region has been used to evaluate the hazard incorporating uncertainties associated with the seismicity parameters using different modeling methodologies. Three types of seismic source models, viz. linear sources, gridded seismicity model and areal sources, were considered to model the seismic sources and different sets of ground motion prediction equations were used for different tectonic provinces to characterize the attenuation properties. The hazard estimation at bedrock level has been carried out using probabilistic approach and the results obtained from various methodologies were combined in a logic tree framework. The seismic site characterization of India was done using topographic slope map derived from Digital Elevation Model data. This paper presents estimation of the hazard at surface level, using appropriate site amplification factors corresponding to various site classes based on VS30 values derived from the topographic gradient.

Abstract: 'AbstractDouble-headed protease inhibitor was isolated, purified and characterized including its kinetics from the fruits of Solanum aculeatissimum Jacq. (SAPI). The inhibitor was purified to homogeneity via four sequential step procedure, i.e., salt precipitation to Sepharose affinity chromatography. The purity was confirmed by reverse phase HPLC chromatography. The molecular mass was detected using size elution chromatography (22.2\xc2\xa0kDa). SAPI inhibits trypsin and chymotrypsin simultaneously and the molar inhibitory ratio for trypsin and chymotrypsin was 1:1, i.e., it functions as double headed PI of Bowman\xe2\x80\x93Birk group. Purified SAPI showed optimal specific activities of 502 and 433.7\xc2\xa0U/mg with trypsin and chymotrypsin, respectively. Overall, the fold of purification increased with remarkable yield. Native-PAGE showed four isoinhibitors (pI: 4.7, 5.2, 5.6 and 5.9). Dixon plots and Lineweaver\xe2\x80\x93Burk double reciprocal plots revealed competitive mode of inhibition. High pH amplitude (2\xe2\x80\x9312) and broad temperature range (10\xe2\x80\x9380\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C) were observed for SAPI.

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Climate trends in the Coffea arabica growing regions of Tanzania are investigated.\xe2\x80\xa2Substantial increases in all three temperature variables (Tmin, Tmax, Tmean) are found.\xe2\x80\xa2Minimum temperatures have substantial influence on coffee yields.AbstractCoffee is the world\xe2\x80\x99s most valuable tropical export crop. Recent studies predict severe climate change impacts on Coffea arabica (C. arabica) production. However, quantitative production figures are necessary to provide coffee stakeholders and policy makers with evidence to justify immediate action. Using data from the northern Tanzanian highlands, we demonstrate for the first time that increasing night time (Tmin) temperature is the most significant climatic variable responsible for diminishing C. arabica yields between 1961 and 2012. Projecting this forward, every 1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C rise in Tmin will result in annual yield losses of 137\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa016.87\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01.80e-10).

Consequently, without adequate adaptation strategies and/or substantial external inputs, coffee production will be severely reduced in the Tanzanian highlands in the near future. Attention should also be drawn to the arabica growing regions of Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ethiopia and Kenya, as substantiated time series evidence shows these areas have followed strikingly similar minimum temperature trends. This is the first study on coffee, globally, providing essential time series evidence that climate change has already had a negative impact on C. arabica yields.'

The study was divided into four groups of five animals each. The first groups (I) received vehicle alone to serve as control. The second, third and fourth groups (II, II and IV) of animals were administered the leaf extract daily at 50 mg/kg body weight, p.o.,100 mg/kg body weight, p.o., and 200 mg/kg body weight, p.o., respectively, for a period of 60 days.ResultsSignificant decreases in the weight of testes, epididymis, seminal vesicle and ventral prostate were observed. A dose related reduction in the testicular sperm count, epididymal sperm count and motility, number of fertile male, ratio between delivered and inseminated females and numbers of pups were observed. The testis showed a clear correlation between the dose and severity of lesions of seminiferous epithelium. In general, the seminiferous tubules appear reduced in size with a frequently filled eosinophilic material. Spermatogenesis arrested at the secondary spermatocyte stage. Pachytene spermatocytes were undergoing degeneration. Disorganigation and sloughing of immature germ cell were visible. Leydinf cells were atrophied. No morphological changes were observed in Sertoli cells. Significant reduction in serum concentration of luteinizing hormone and testosterone were observed. No distinct change in serum FSH concentration was recorded. The final body weights of all groups were elevated markedly. No alterations were recorded in any hematologiocal parameters.ConclusionIt is concluded that the 50% ethanol extract of T. divaricata leaf produced dose related effect on male reproduction without altering general body metabolism.'

Abstract: 'AbstractA set of 50 rice genotypes comprising landraces, local selections, and improved varieties were characterized using simple sequence repeat (SSR) and inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers to study genetic diversity and population structure. Following unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean based clustering using binary data of polymorphic markers, the genotypes were grouped into 5 clusters and 11 sub-clusters, whereas population structure analysis separated 50 rice genotypes into 5 sub-populations. Grouping of rice genotypes showed better resemblance with the pedigree information of the genotypes. Both genetic diversity and population structure analysis separated majority of the improved varieties from landraces and local selections. Some of the SSR markers amplified unique alleles which were specific to a particular genotype and could distinguish them from the rest. The results indicate that these rice genotypes exhibit a higher genetic diversity and can be very useful in rice improvement program.'

Title: 'ReviewInter and intra-specific diversity of parasites that cause lymphatic filariasis'
Author: 'Samantha N.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134812003425
Abstract: 'AbstractLymphatic filariasis is caused by three closely related nematode parasites: Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi and Brugia timori. These species have many ecological variants that differ in several aspects of their biology such as mosquito vector species, host range, periodicity, and morphology. Although the genome of B. malayi (the first genome sequenced from a parasitic nematode) has been available for more than five years, very little is known about genetic variability among the lymphatic dwelling filariae. The genetic diversity among these worms is not only interesting from a biological perspective, but it may have important practical implications for the Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis, as the parasites may respond differently to diagnostic tests and/or medical interventions. Therefore, better information on their genetic variability is urgently needed. With improved methods for nucleic acid extraction and recent advances in sequencing chemistry and instrumentation, this gap can be filled relatively inexpensively. Improved information on filarial genetic diversity may increase the chances of success for lymphatic filariasis elimination programs.Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2 Three filarial species cause lymphatic filariasis and encompass various ecological variants. \xe2\x80\xa2 Filarial parasites react differently regarding diagnostics, pathogenesis and chemotherapy. \xe2\x80\xa2 Available genomic data provide scarce knowledge of their inter- and intra- species variation. \xe2\x80\xa2 Technological advances will facilitate the study of inter- and intra-species variation in the future. \xe2\x80\xa2 Genome sequencing of clinical isolates will provide insight into the impact of intervention on parasite genetics.'

Abstract: 'AbstractCurrent agricultural production methods, for example the improper use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, create many health and environmental problems. Use of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) for agricultural benefits is increasing worldwide and also appears to be a trend for the future. There is possibility to develop microbial inoculants for use in agricultural biotechnology, based on these beneficial plant\xe2\x80\x93microbe interactions. For this study, ten bacterial strains were isolated from Yongin forest soil for which in vitro plant-growth promoting trait screenings, such as indole acetic acid (IAA) production, a phosphate solubilization test, and a siderophore production test were used to select two PGPB candidates. Arabidopsis thaliana plants were inoculated with Paenibacillus yonginensis DCY84T and Micrococcus yunnanensis PGPB7. Salt stress, drought stress and heavy metal (aluminum) stress challenges indicated that P. yonginensis DCY84T-inoculated plants were more resistant than control plants. AtRSA1, AtVQ9 and AtWRKY8 were used as the salinity responsive genes. The AtERD15, AtRAB18, and AtLT178 were selected to check A. thaliana responses to drought stress. Aluminum stress response was checked using AtAIP, AtALS3 and AtALMT1. The qRT-PCR results indicated that P. yonginensis DCY84T can promote plant tolerance against salt, drought, and aluminum stress. P. yonginensis DCY84T also showed positive results during in vitro compatibility testing and virulence assay against X. oryzae pv. oryzae Philippine race 6 (PXO99). Better germination rates and growth parameters were also recorded for the P. yonginensis DCY84T Chuchung cultivar rice seed which was grown on coastal soil collected from Suncheon. Based on these results, P. yonginensis DCY84T can be used as a promising PGPB isolate for crop improvement.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Wetlands in India account for 4.7% of the total geographical area of the country.\xe2\x80\xa2These wetlands provide numerous ecosystem goods and services, but are under stress.\xe2\x80\xa2Reasons for wetlands loss in India are urbanization, land use changes and pollution.\xe2\x80\xa2There is no proper regulatory framework for conservation of wetlands in India.\xe2\x80\xa2Future research should focus on institutional factors influencing their condition.AbstractStudy regionIndia.Study focusIndia has a wealth of wetland ecosystems that support diverse and unique habitats. These wetlands provide numerous ecological goods and services but are under tremendous stress due to rapid urbanization, industrialization and agricultural intensification, manifested by the shrinkage in their areal extent, and decline in the hydrological, economic and ecological functions they perform. This paper reviews the wetland wealth of India in terms of their geographic distribution and extent, ecosystem benefits they provide, and the various stresses they are exposed to. The paper also discusses the efforts at management of these fragile ecosystems, identifies the institutional vacuum and suggests priority area where immediate attention is required in order to formulate better conservation strategies for these productive systems.New hydrological insights for the regionIt has been found that management of wetlands has received inadequate attention in the national water sector agenda. As a result, many of the wetlands are subject to anthropogenic pressures, including land use changes in the catchment; pollution from industry and households; encroachments; tourism; and over exploitation of their natural resources. Further, majority of research on wetland management in India relates to the limnological aspects and ecological/environmental economics of wetland management. But, the physical (such as hydrological and land use changes in the catchment) and socio-economic processes leading to limnological changes have not been explored substantially.'

Title: 'Prioritization of Sub Watershed Based on Morphometric Characteristics Using Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process and Geographical Information System \xe2\x80\x93 A Study of Kallar Watershed, Tamil Nadu\xe2\x98\x86'

Abstract: 'AbstractWatershed prioritization has gained importance in natural resources management, especially in the context of watershed management. Delineation of watersheds within a large drainage basin and their prioritization is required for proper planning and management of natural resources for sustainable development. Delineation of potential zones for implementation of conservation measures above the entire watershed at similar occurrence is inaccessible as well as uneconomical; therefore it is a prerequisite to apply viable technique for prioritization of sub watersheds (SW). The present research attempted to study various morphological characteristics and to implement Geographical Information System (GIS) and Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) through Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) techniques for identification of critical sub watersheds situated in transaction zone between mountainous and water scarcity region of kallar watershed, Tamil Nadu. The morphometric characterization was obtained through the measurement of three distinct linear, areal and relief aspects over the eleven sub-watersheds. The morphometric characterization showed vital role in distinguishing the topographical and hydrological behavior of the watershed. Each morphometric parameters were ranked with respect to the value and weightings obtained by deriving the relationships between the morphometric parameters obtained through classification of the SW by associating the strength of Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Processes (FAHP). Based on FAHP approach, sub watersheds were evaluated and divided into five prioritization zones: very less, less, medium, high and very high classes. The FAHP techniques is a practical approach for identification of the sensitive priority zones and is useful for better management practices such as implementation of land and water resource management, conservation and sustainable agricultural development.'

Abstract: 'AbstractTropical Asian Galliformes are secretive and difficult to survey. Many of these species are considered \xe2\x80\x9cat risk\xe2\x80\x9d due to habitat degradation although reliable density estimates are lacking. Using camera trapping and distance sampling data collected on the Siamese Fireback (Lophura diardi) in northeastern Thailand, we compared density estimates for pristine and degraded lowland forest. Density was poorly estimated using distance sampling, likely due to small sample size arising from poor visibility in dense vegetation and bird\xe2\x80\x99s sensitivity to observers. We analysed camera trap data using both count-based and presence/absence-based methods. Those density estimates had narrower confidence intervals than those obtained using distance sampling. Estimated density was higher in dry evergreen forest (5.6\xc2\xa0birds\xc2\xa0km\xe2\x88\x922), than in old forest plantations (0.2\xc2\xa0birds\xc2\xa0km\xe2\x88\x922), perhaps because dense forest habitats provide Firebacks with more resources and refuge from predation. Our results suggest that camera trap data can be used for estimating density of cryptic terrestrial bird species inhabiting tropical forest that lack unique identification markings. However, this technique requires that the effective sampling area is known and thus requires knowledge of the animal home range size.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2There is often a causal link between continental flood basalts climates and mass extinctions.\xe2\x80\xa2Development of palaeosols in most of the flood basalts represents inter-eruptive time intervals.\xe2\x80\xa2These paleosols can help in understanding environmental developments during volcanic activity.AbstractSince continental sediments (in addition to the marine geological record) offer important means of deciphering environmental changes, the sediments hosted by the successive flows of the continental flood basalt provinces of the world should be treasure houses in gathering the palaeoclimatic data. Palaeosols developed on top of basalt flows are potentially ideal for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions because it is easy to determine their protolith geochemistry and also they define a definite time interval. The present paper summarizes the nature of the basalt-hosted palaeosols formed on the flood basalts provinces from different parts of the globe having different ages.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image'

Title: 'Spatio-Temporal Clustering of Road Accidents: GIS Based Analysis and Assessment'
Author: 'V.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042811013437
Abstract: "AbstractRoad accident hot spots are evaluated and delineated in a South Indian city where inadequate development of land transport network often leads to traffic congestion and accidents. The patterns of localization and distribution of hotspots are examined with the help of geo-information technology to bring out the influence of spatial and/or temporal factors in their formation. Assessment of spatial clustering of accidents and hotspots spatial densities was carried out following Moran's I method of spatial autocorrelation, Getis-Ord Gi* statistics and point Kernel density functions. The accidents as a whole show a clustered nature while the comparison of spatio-temporal break ups indicates random distribution in certain classes. The Kernel density surface, estimated from the results of hotspot analysis delineates the road stretches as well as isolated zones where the hotspots are concentrated. The results can be effectively used by various agencies for adopting better planning and management strategies for improved traffic conditions as well as accident reduction."

Reverse phase-HPLC and GC-MS studies were carried out to identify the major phytochemicals in the fraction using phytochemical standards. Cytotoxicity and the potential of the fraction against CHIKV were evaluated in vitro using Vero cells. Reduction in viral replication was assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) after treating the viral infected Vero cells with the fraction.ResultsReverse Phase-HPLC and GC-MS studies confirmed the presence of flavonoids, luteolin and apigenin as major phytochemicals in the anti-CHIKV ethanolic fraction of C. dactylon. The fraction was found to exhibit potent viral inhibitory activity (about 98%) at the concentration of 50 \xc2\xb5g/mL as observed by reduction in cytopathic effect, and the cytotoxic concentration of the fraction was found to be 250 \xc2\xb5g/mL. RT-PCR analyses indicated that the reduction in viral mRNA synthesis in fraction treated infected cells was much higher than the viral infected control cells.ConclusionsLuteolin and apigenin rich ethanolic fraction from C. dactylon can be utilized as a potential therapeutic agent against CHIKV infection as the fraction does not show cytotoxicity while inhibiting the virus."

Abstract: 'AbstractSheath blight of rice (Oryza sativa L.) caused by Rhizoctonia solani is a major disease and attempts are being made to develop microbe based technologies for biocontrol of this pathogen. However, the mechanisms of biocontrol are not fully understood and still require indepth study in the backdrop of emerging concepts in biological systems. The present investigation was aimed at deciphering the mechanisms of biocontrol of sheath blight of rice employing Pseudomonas fluorescens and Trichoderma harzianum as model agents for biocontrol. Initially 25, 5 and 5 strains of P. fluorescens, T. viride and T. harzianum, respectively, were screened for their biocontrol potential. Out of which, six strains with higher value of percent inhibition of fungal mycelium in dual plate assay were selected. The role of P. fluorescens, T. viride and T. harzianum were investigated in induction and bioaccumulation of natural antioxidants, defence-related biomolecules and other changes in plant which lead not only to growth promotion but also protection from pathogenic stress conditions in rice. The two most promising strains, P. fluorescens PF-08 and T. harzianum UBSTH-501 selected on the basis of in planta evaluation, when applied individually or in combination, significantly enhanced the accumulation of defence-related biomolecules, enzymes and exhibited biocontrol potential against R. solani. A modified/newly developed delivery system was applied for the first time in the experiments involving inoculation of plants with both bioagents, viz. P. fluorescens PF-08 and T. harzianum UBSTH-501. Results suggested that application of P. fluorescens PF-08 and T. harzianum UBSTH-501 alone or in combination, not only helps in control of the disease but also increases plant growth along with reduction in application of toxic chemical pesticides.'

Abstract: 'AbstractObjectiveTo evaluate the phytochemical and anti-bacterial efficacy of the seed kernel extract of Mangifera indica (M. indica) against the enteropathogen, Shigella dysenteriae (S. dysenteriae), isolated from the diarrhoeal stool specimens.MethodsThe preliminary phytochemical screening was performed by the standard methods as described by Harborne. Cold extraction method was employed to extract the bioactive compounds from mango seed kernel. Disc diffusion method was adopted to screen antibacterial activity. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was evaluated by agar dilution method. The crude extracts were partially purified by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and the fractions were analyzed by high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) to identify the bioactive compounds.ResultsPhytochemical scrutiny of M. indica indicated the presence of phytochemical constituents such as alkaloids, gums, flavanoids, phenols, saponins, steroids, tannins and xanthoproteins. Antibacterial activity was observed in two crude extracts and various fractions viz. hexane, benzene, chloroform, methanol and water. MIC of methanol fraction was found to be (95\xc2\xb111.8) \xce\xbcg/mL. MIC of other fractions ranged from 130\xe2\x80\x93380 \xce\xbcg/mL.ConclusionsThe present study confirmed that each crude extracts and fractions of M. indica have significant antimicrobial activity against the isolated pathogen S. dysenteriae. The antibacterial activity may be due to the phytochemical constituents of the mango seed kernel. The phytochemical tannin could be the reason for its antibacterial activity.'

Title: 'Phylogenetic relationships of African microhylid frogs inferred from DNA sequences of mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA genes'
Author: 'Simon P.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439609204000480
Abstract: 'AbstractThe phylogenetic relationships of microhylid frogs are poorly understood. The first molecular phylogeny for continental African microhylids is presented, including representatives of all subfamilies, six of the eight genera, and the enigmatic hemisotid Hemisus. Mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA sequence data were analysed using parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian methods. Analyses of the data are consistent with the monophyly of all sampled subfamilies and genera. Hemisus does not nest within either brevicipitines or non-brevicipitines. It is possibly the sister group to brevicipitines, in which case brevicipitines might not be microhylids. Phrynomantis and Hoplophryne potentially group with non-African, non-brevicipitine microhylids, in agreement with recent morphological and molecular data. Within brevicipitines, Breviceps is recovered as the sister group to a clade of Callulina+Spelaeophryne+Probreviceps. The relationships among the genera within this latter clade are unclear, being sensitive to the method of analysis. Optimal trees suggest the Probreviceps macrodactylus subspecies complex might be paraphyletic with respect to P. uluguruensis, corroborating preliminary morphological studies indicating that P. m. rungwensis may be a distinct species. P. m. loveridgei may be paraphyletic with respect to P. m. macrodactylus, though this is not strongly supported. Some biogeographic hypotheses are examined in light of these findings.'

Title: 'Phylogeny, biogeography and a new taxonomy for the Gecarcinucoidea Rathbun, 1904 (Decapoda: Brachyura)'
Author: 'Sebastian'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439609206000250
Abstract: 'AbstractPhylogenetic relationships of gecarcinucoid freshwater crabs were investigated, based on morphology of the male second gonopod. In addition, a comparison of sequences from the mitochondrial large subunit rRNA gene helped to resolve the phylogeny of this group and relationships to other Old World freshwater crabs. As a result, we recognise two sister groups within the Gecarcinucoidea, the African Deckeniidae and the Asian Gecarcinucidae. Deckeniidae includes three monophyletic clades, the Deckeniinae in East Africa and on the Seychelles, the West African Globonautinae and the Malagasy Hydrothelphusinae. Gecarcinucidae comprises two sister groups, the Gecarcinucinae with representatives in Sri Lanka, India and southeast Asia, and the Parathelphusinae in India, southeast Asia, the Sundaic Islands and Australia. Interpretation of our phylogenetic results leads us to propose a new biogeographic hypothesis for the Gecarcinucoidea. Most likely, the gecarcinucoid freshwater crabs have an African origin; their distribution can be explained by successive events of dispersal. This model can be correlated with palaeogeographical and palaeoclimatological data for the Cenozoic, suggesting a gecarcinucoid dispersal to Asia via the \xe2\x80\x9cLemurian Stepping-Stones\xe2\x80\x9d, a chain of islands in the West-Indian Ocean that were emergent in times of low sea levels during the Oligocene.'

Title: 'Research ArticleDivergent DNA Methylation Patterns Associated with Abiotic Stress in Hevea brasiliensis'
Author: 'Thomas K.'

Abstract: 'ABSTRACTCytosine methylation is a fundamental epigenetic mechanism for gene-expression regulation and development in plants. Here, we report for the first time the identification of DNA methylation patterns and their putative relationship with abiotic stress in the tree crop Hevea brasiliensis (source of 99% of natural rubber in the world). Regulatory sequences of four major genes involved in the mevalonate pathway (rubber biosynthesis pathway) and one general defense-related gene of three high-yielding popular rubber clones grown at two different agroclimatic conditions were analyzed for the presence of methylation. We found several significant variations in the methylation pattern at core DNA binding motifs within all the five genes. Several consistent clone-specific and location-specific methylation patterns were identified. The differences in methylation pattern observed at certain pivotal cis-regulatory sites indicate the direct impact of stress on the genome and support the hypothesis of site-specific stress-induced DNA methylation. It is assumed that some of the methylation patterns observed may be involved in the stress-responsive mechanism in plants by which they adapt to extreme conditions. The study also provide clues towards the existence of highly divergent phenotypic characters among Hevea clones despite their very similar genetic make-up. Altogether, the observations from this study prove beyond doubt that there exist epigenetic variations in Hevea and environmental factors play a significant role in the induction of site-specific epigenetic mutations in its genome.'

Title: 'Screening of antagonistic bacteria for biological control of nursery wilt of black pepper (Piper nigrum)'
Author: 'K.N.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S094450130470107X
Abstract: 'SummaryBacterial antagonists of Phytophthora capsici were isolated from underground shoot portions of rooted cuttings of black pepper. Initially isolates were screened by dual culture on potato dextrose agar and carrot agar. Further, a screening was done on black pepper shoots for supression of lesion caused by the pathogen. Most of the antagonists showed varying levels of antagonism in the dual culture and the shoot assay. Isolate PN-026, showing the highest suppression of lesion development in the shoot assay was found to be the most efficient antagonist in reducing Phytophthora capsici induced nursery wilt of black pepper. This screening involving the host, pathogen, and the antagonist, performed on black pepper shoot (the planting material for this vegetatively propagated crop), could be used as a rapid and reliable method for the isolation of efficient bacterial antagonists of P. capsici.'

Fifty years meteorological data were collected from meteorological department. Diversity status were analyzed from all fisheries data by using PAST (version 2.15) software. Findings showed that Meghna river estuary is the habitat of 53 fish species and Oxyurichthys microlepis, Hemiarius sona Arius thalassinus, Batrachocephalus mino and Arius caelatus are the major contributory species (>6%) for both spatio-temporal scales. Water temperature and rainfall was found as major influential factors for species distribution.'

Title: 'Research PaperDominant Lid Tectonics behaviour of continental lithosphere in\xc2\xa0Precambrian times: Palaeomagnetism confirms prolonged quasi-integrity and absence of supercontinent cycles'
Author: 'J.D.A.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987117301329
Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The PALEOMAGIA database confirms dominant Lid Tectonics on Earth between \xe2\x88\xbc2.8 and 0.6\xc2\xa0Ga.\xe2\x80\xa2Continental crust was centred at the rotation pole in a single hemisphere between 2.2 and 0.6\xc2\xa0Ga.\xe2\x80\xa2A single \xe2\x88\xbc90\xc2\xb0 excusion of the supercontinent between 2.7 and 2.2\xc2\xa0Ga is defined in the geologic record.\xe2\x80\xa2Lid break-up at \xe2\x88\xbc0.6\xc2\xa0Ga is recorded by multiple environmental signatures.AbstractAlthough Plate Tectonics cannot be effectively tested by palaeomagnetism in the Precambrian aeon due to the paucity of high precision poles spanning such a long time period, the possibility of Lid Tectonics is eminently testable because it seeks accordance of the wider dataset over prolonged intervals of time; deficiencies and complexities in the data merely contribute to dispersion. Accordance of palaeomagnetic poles across a quasi-integral continental crust for time periods of up to thousands of millions of years, together with recognition of very long intervals characterised by minimal polar motions (\xe2\x88\xbc2.6\xe2\x80\x932.0, \xe2\x88\xbc1.5\xe2\x80\x931.25 and \xe2\x88\xbc0.75\xe2\x80\x930.6\xc2\xa0Ga) has been used to demonstrate that Lid Tectonics dominated this aeon. The new PALEOMAGIA database is used to refine a model for the Precambrian lid incorporating a large quasi-integral crescentric core running from South-Central Africa through Laurentia to Siberia with peripheral cratons subject to reorganisation at \xe2\x88\xbc2.1, \xe2\x88\xbc1.6 and \xe2\x88\xbc1.1\xc2\xa0Ga. The model explains low levels of tidal friction, reduced heat balance, unique petrologic and isotopic signatures, and the prolonged crustal stability of Earth's \xe2\x80\x9cMiddle Age\xe2\x80\x9d, whilst density concentrations of the palaeomagnetic poles show that the centre of the continental lid was persistently focussed near Earth's rotation axis from \xe2\x88\xbc2.8 to 0.6\xc2\xa0Ga. The exception was the \xe2\x88\xbc2.7\xe2\x80\x932.2\xc2\xa0Ga interval defined by \xe2\x88\xbc90\xc2\xb0 polar movements which translated the periphery of the lid to the rotation pole for this quasi-static period, a time characterised by glaciation and low levels of magmatic activity; the \xe2\x88\xbc2.7\xc2\xa0Ga shift correlates with key interval of mid-Archaean crustal growth to some 60\xe2\x80\x9370% of the present volume and REE signatures whilst the \xe2\x88\xbc2.2\xc2\xa0Ga shift correlates with the Lomagundi \xce\xb413 C and Great Oxygenation events. The palaeomagnetic signature of breakup of the lid at \xe2\x88\xbc0.6\xc2\xa0Ga is recorded by the world-wide Ediacaran development of passive margins and associated environmental signatures of new ocean basins. This event defined the end of a dominant Lid Tectonic phase in the history of Earth's continental lithosphere recorded by the quasi-integral Precambrian supercontinent Palaeopangaea and the beginning of the comprehensive Plate Tectonics which has characterised the Phanerozoic aeon. Peripheral modifications to the lid achieved a symmetrical and hemispheric shape in Neoproterozoic times comparable to the familiar short-lived supercontinent (Neo)Pangaea (\xe2\x88\xbc350\xe2\x80\x93150\xc2\xa0Ma) and this appears to be the sole supercontinent cycle recorded by the palaeomagnetic record. Prolonged integrity of a large continental nucleus accompanied by periodic readjustments of peripheral shields can reconcile divergent tectonic analyses of Precambrian times which on the one hand propose multiple Wilson Cycles to explain some signatures of Plate Tectonics, and alternative interpretations which consider that Plate Tectonics did not commence until the end of the Neoproterozoic.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (177KB)Download full-size image"

Also included is an overview undertaken on the phytochemistry and toxicity of plants used in treatments related to diseases of the skin. Some findings include the predominance of leaf material used (48%), as well as the frequent use of decoctions (35%). Dermatological skin pathogens such as Propionibacterium acnes, Microsporum canis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton floccosum are recommended for study in future antimicrobial research. Attention to these aspects should lead to new directives for commercialization and provide insight towards the understanding of some neglected plant species used for the treatment of skin diseases.'

Title: 'Adaptation and the color statistics of natural images'
Author: 'Michael A.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698997001259
Abstract: 'AbstractColor perception depends profoundly on adaptation processes that adjust sensitivity in response to the prevailing pattern of stimulation. We examined how color sensitivity and appearance might be influenced by adaptation to the color distributions characteristic of natural images. Color distributions were measured for natural scenes by sampling an array of locations within each scene with a spectroradiometer, or by recording each scene with a digital camera successively through 31 interference filters. The images were used to reconstruct the L, M and S cone excitation at each spatial location, and the contrasts along three post-receptoral axes [L + M, L \xe2\x88\x92 M or S \xe2\x88\x92 (L + M)]. Individual scenes varied substantially in their mean chromaticity and luminance, in the principal color-luminance axes of their distributions, and in the range of contrasts in their distributions. Chromatic contrasts were biased along a relatively narrow range of bluish to yellowish-green angles, lying roughly between the S - (L + M) axis (which was more characteristic of scenes with lush vegetation and little sky) and a unique blue-yellow axis (which was more typical of arid scenes). For many scenes L - M and S - (L + M) signals were highly correlated, with weaker correlations between luminance and chromaticity. We use a two-stage model (von Kries scaling followed by decorrelation) to show how the appearance of colors may be altered by light adaptation to the mean if the distributions and by contrast adaptation to the contrast range and principal axes of the distributions; and we show that such adjustments are qualitatively consistent with empirical measurements of asymmetric color matches obtained after adaptation to successive random samples drawn from natural distributions of chromaticities and lightnesses. Such adaptation effects define the natural range of operating states of the visual system.'
