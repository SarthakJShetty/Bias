Abstract: 'We record here the occurrence of five exotic fish species viz Oreochromis mossambicus, Gambusia affinis, Osphronemus goramy, Xiphophorus maculatus and Poecilia reticulata in the Chalakudy River, part of the Western Ghats, a global biodiversity hotspot in Kerala, India. O. mossambicus was ubiquitous in occurrence with large shoals being encountered at all sampling sites spread along the downstream-upstream gradient of the river, including at an altitude of 1050\xc2\xa0m ASL. Osphronemus goramy was recorded from the downstream region of the river while Gambusia affinis was recorded from three sampling sites located downstream as well as midstream. Xiphophorus maculatus was collected from a second order stream flowing through a tea plantation at an altitude of 1050\xc2\xa0m ASL. Samples of brooders and early fry of Poecilia reticulata indicate that the fish has already established a breeding population in the river. Possible threats to the indigenous fish fauna of the Chalakudy River as a result of the invasion and proliferation of these exotics is discussed.'

Abstract: 'Seventy one fish species belonging to 27 families and 50 genera were collected from various sampling sites spread along the upstream and downstream parts of the Chalakudy river, in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in Kerala, South India. Cyprinids were the most dominant group represented by 24 species belonging to 13 genera, followed by the catfishes of the family Bagridae (7 species from 2 genera) and loaches belonging to the family Balitoridae (5 species from 5 genera). Of the 71 species, 4 belong to the \xe2\x80\x98critically endangered\xe2\x80\x99 (CR) and 16 to the \xe2\x80\x98endangered\xe2\x80\x99 (EN) category. 3 of the critically endangered species are strictly endemic to the Chalakudy river system. We also collected 5 exotic species several of them categorized as potential pest. Fish species richness (FSR) showed a direct relationship with increasing stream order with maximum values observed in the downstream/low elevation regions. Considerable differences were observed in the FSR between different microhabitats with maximum values observed in bed rock and pool riffle and the lowest in regimes followed by step pools. Diversity and species richness decreased with increasing altitude and higher diversity and species richness were observed in sampling sites located between 0\xe2\x80\x93200\xc2\xa0m above sea level. A definite temporal partitioning was also observed with regard to FSR with higher richness during the day time and the lowest observed at dawn. Indiscriminate collection of endemic and threatened ornamental fish species for export, exploitation of endangered food fishes by forest-dwelling communities and local fisher folk, pollution, loss of riparian cover, damming and exotic species threaten the rich ichthyofaunal diversity of Chalakudy River. An urgent need exists for studying the life history traits and demography of the most important endemic and threatened fishes, as lack of information on these aspects have significantly affected conservation efforts. The implementation of strong management strategies like fixing total allowable catch (TAC), and the use of quotas are needed to reduce the overall collection pressure with regard to the trade in native ornamental species from the river.'

Abstract: "High taxonomic level endemism in the Western Ghats-Sri Lanka biodiversity hotspot has been typically attributed to the subcontinent's geological history of long-term isolation. Subsequent out of \xe2\x80\x93 and into India dispersal of species after accretion to the Eurasian mainland is therefore often seen as a biogeographic factor that 'diluted' the composition of previously isolated Indian biota. However, few molecular studies have focussed on into-India dispersal as a possible source of endemism on the subcontinent. Using c. 6000 base pairs of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, we investigated the evolutionary history and biogeography of true toads (Bufonidae), a group that colonized the Indian Subcontinent after the Indo-Asia collision."

Abstract: 'A permanent plot of 30 ha (600 \xc3\x97 500 m2) was established for long-term ecological research on biodiversity and forest functioning in a tropical evergreen forest at Varagalaiar, Anamalais, Western Ghats. This paper gives the results of the first census of trees in the 30 ha plot. All trees \xe2\x89\xa530 cm gbh were permanently tagged with sequentially numbered aluminium tags and their girth measured. 148 tree species (in 120 genera and 49 families) were enumerated in a total sample of 13,393 individuals. Species diversity, density and dispersion patterns were determined. The mean species richness, density and basal area per hectare were 65 species, 446 stems and 36.26 m2 respectively. The Sorensen similarity index for thirty 1-ha subplots varied from 0.7 to 0.9, indicating the homogeneity in species composition of the stand. The pronounced species hierarchy has resulted in the dominance of four species that occupy four different forest storeys: Drypetes longifolia (lower storey) Reinwardtiodendron anamallayanum (middle storey), Poeciloneuron indicum (upper storey) and Dipterocarpus indicus (emergent). The forest was dominated by Euphorbiaceae in terms of richness (18 species) and abundance of species (3788 stems), and Dipterocarpaceae based on the contribution to basal area (18.4%). Species richness and density decreased with increasing girth-class. Girth class frequency of the stand exhibited an expanding population of trees. Twenty-nine tree species, analysed for spatial dispersion at 1-ha scale, exhibited both clumped and uniform patterns, except Vateria indica which was randomly distributed in one hectare. Repeat census scheduled for subsequent years, will elucidate the behaviour of the individual species and the population dynamics of the tree flora and will be useful for forest conservation and management. It will also help to monitor human activity within this forest.'

Abstract: 'Western Ghats are considered as one of the global biodiversity hotspots. There is an information gap on conservation status of the biodiversity hotspots. This study has quantified estimates of deforestation in the Western Ghats over a period of past nine decades. The classified forest cover maps for 1920, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013 indicates 95,446 (73.1%), 63,123 (48.4%), 62,286 (47.7%), 61,551 (47.2%), 61,511 (47.1%) and 61,511 km2 (47.1%) of the forest area, respectively. The rates of deforestation have been analyzed in different time phases, i.e., 1920\xe2\x80\x931975, 1975\xe2\x80\x931985, 1985\xe2\x80\x931995, 1995\xe2\x80\x932005 and 2005\xe2\x80\x932013. The grid cells of 1 km2 have been generated for time series analysis and describing spatial changes in forests. The net rate of deforestation was found to be 0.75 during 1920\xe2\x80\x931975, 0.13 during 1975\xe2\x80\x931985, 0.12 during 1985\xe2\x80\x931995 and 0.01 during 1995\xe2\x80\x932005. Overall forest loss in Western Ghats was estimated as 33,579 km2 (35.3% of the total forest) from 1920\xe2\x80\x99s to 2013. Land use change analysis indicates highest transformation of forest to plantations, followed by agriculture and degradation to scrub. The dominant forest type is tropical semi-evergreen which comprises 21,678 km2 (35.2%) of the total forest area of Western Ghats, followed by wet evergreen forest (30.6%), moist deciduous forest (24.8%) and dry deciduous forest (8.1%) in 2013. Even though it has the highest population density among the hotspots, there is no quantifiable net rate of deforestation from 2005 to 2013 which indicates increased measures of conservation.'

Abstract: 'DNA barcodes analyzed by using relevant techniques provide an imperative approach towards validation of prevailing taxa and putative species. Here, molecular methods were used for assessment of 246 barcodes belonging to 81 fish species from northern Western Ghats of India, using, Barcode gap analysis, barcode index number, automatic barcode gap discovery, Poisson tree processes and general mixed Yule-coalescent, these methods had their potential to discriminate 97.53%, 93.90% 95.06%, 93.82% and 92.59% of species respectively. But, some of them tended to estimate the inconsistent number of species leading to discrepancies between the morphological concept and inference from molecular phylogenetic reconstructions. So, we took a standard approach to recognize those methods that produced consistent results, three of five such methods were identified that revealed three hidden cryptic species complexes in Monopterus indicus, Parambassis ranga and Systomus sarana. Further, to validate these three genetically diverged species, we used diagnostic character based approach along with nine unidentified species through BLOG and WEKAs SMO classifier. Those methods were unable to identify these species, which might be due to the limited number of specimens used for the analysis. This is the first effort to generate the DNA barcode reference library of freshwater fishes from northern Western Ghats of India, one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biodiversity hotspots. These barcodes when analyzed through the defined workflow, will provide valuable measures to prove the efficiency of molecular species delimitation methods in taxonomic discrimination which aid conservation of biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Understanding of biodiversity on a local scale is extremely important for effective conservation measures, especially in biodiversity hotpsots hosting diverse endemic flora and fauna and subject to strong anthropogenic influences. Little is known about patterns of local biodiversity and the processes generating it in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot: the patterns of genetic diversity and biogeographic affinities are poorly known for most of the species from this region. We studied the genetic diversity and population structuring of an endemic frog Indirana cf beddomii, from 12 localities of Western Ghats using 15 polymorphic microsatellite loci. The genetic diversity as measured by mean expected heterozygosity (H E\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.83) or allelic richness (A r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa010.41) was high and similar in all localities. Significant genetic differentiation (mean F ST\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.075) with a strong pattern of isolation by distance (IBD) across the localities was observed. Clearest genetic discontinuities in the data corresponded to topographic gaps suggesting that apart from IBD, genetic structuring in this species is strongly influenced by habitat matrix. In general, the results provide novel insight into factors that may impact the genetic diversity and population structuring of endemic amphibians in this biodiversity hotspot.'

Abstract: 'Frogs in the genus Indirana are endemic to Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. The species are poorly studied and in many cases threatened or endangered. Here we describe primers and polymerase chain reactions for 62 microsatellite loci for Indirana beddomii, one of the commonest frogs in the genus. Fifty-six of the primers were polymorphic on sample of 23 individuals from a single sampling site (Ponmudi, Kerala) with an average 9.11 alleles per locus (range\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x9320). The average observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.64 and 0.71, respectively. The loci should be useful in conservation genetic studies of Indirana frogs.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity and ecosystem services play key roles in future economic strategies seeking to promote development and prosperity. This study assesses the status of biodiversity and flow of ecosystem services from selected forest types in the Western Ghats. At the sampling sites, the number of tree species ranged from 16 to 79 per hectare depending on the forest type. The estimates for Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Wiener index for trees in the evergreen, moist deciduous and dry deciduous forest plots were 3.02, 2.9 and 1.54, respectively. The total biomass carbon stocks in evergreen, moist deciduous and dry deciduous forests in the study area was 229, 221 and 189\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0C/ha, respectively. Analysis of dependency patterns of local communities on forest resources indicated a high dependency on provisional services such as fuelwood, manure and fodder. The study records the highest dependency rates for fuelwood, ranging between 72 and 100% for the three forest types and indicates that forest ecosystems underpin the well-being of the population dependent directly and indirectly on them.'

Abstract: 'Improved understanding of the processes shaping the assembly of tropical tree communities is crucial for gaining insights into the evolution of forest communities and biological diversity. The climate is thought to be the first order determinant of abundance and distribution patterns of tree species with contrasting traits such as evergreen and deciduous leaf phenology. However, the relative role of neutral, and niche-based processes in the evolution of these patterns remain poorly understood.'

Abstract: 'Earth Observation with large suite of sensors and with capabilities to address natural resources at multiple scales has proven to be a critical resource in setting conservation priorities of a region. The role of earth observation data was recognized towards achieving international biodiversity targets by 2020. Ecosystem irreplaceability and ecosystem vulnerability are two concepts key to understanding and preparing conservation priority maps. This study presents spatial conservation prioritization analysis for forests of \xe2\x80\x98Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot\xe2\x80\x99. Earth observation data products have been used for prioritization of areas of irreplaceability and vulnerability that are significant for conservation planning. The spatial surrogates of biodiversity in terms of very dense forest, biological richness, intactness and rarity of habitat are analyzed for evaluation of ecosystem irreplaceability. Fragmentation, forest fires, plant invasion and disturbance index are surrogates included for spatial analysis of ecosystem vulnerability. Vegetation type wise analysis indicates dry deciduous forests are under high vulnerability, followed by moist deciduous forests. The high concentration of irreplaceability is observed in Shola followed by wet evergreen forests and semi-evergreen forests. Spatial prioritization approach has identified about 18% of the forest area as irreplaceable which represents overlapped area of very dense forest, shola, intact forest and high biological richness. We observed that the overlap of forest areas of irreplaceability with vulnerability in southern Western Ghats, which needs high priority of conservation. This study is the first of its kind wherein multi-source earth observation data has been analysed to examine the quantitative criteria at regional level in Western Ghats.'

Abstract: 'Species diversity, density, population structure and dispersion patterns of all trees and lianas (\xe2\x89\xa530cm gbh) were inventoried in a tropical semi-evergreen forest in the Shervarayan hills of Eastern Ghats, south India. Such data are necessary for ecosystem conservation of the under-studied Eastern Ghats, as extensive forests here have already been converted to coffee and orange plantations and the landscape changed due to aluminium ore mining and quarrying. Four 1-ha plots were established in Sanyasimalai (SM) reserve forest of the Shervarayan hills, one plot (SM1) located close to mining and quarrying area, two other contiguous plots (SM2 and SM3) located in selective felling area and the fourth (SM4) in a relatively undisturbed forest. These are 1 to 4km apart in the same semi-evergreen forest tract. In the four study plots a total of 3260 stems (mean density 815ha\xe2\x88\x921) covering 80 species in 71 genera and 44 plant families were recorded. Species richness was greatest in the undisturbed plot SM4 (50), while lowest (33) in the selectively felled site SM2. The forest stand (SM4) was also denser (986 stemsha\xe2\x88\x921) and more voluminous (basal area 44.3m2ha\xe2\x88\x921 as compared with the site mean of 35m2ha\xe2\x88\x921) than the other plots. Four trees, Chionanthus paniculata, Syzygium cumini, Canthium dicoccum and Ligustrum perrottetii dominated the stand, collectively contributing to >50% of the total density. Species richness and stand density decreased with increasing tree girths. The forest stand contained a growing population, but there was considerable variation in basal area distribution between the plots. Trends in species population structure varied, particularly for selective-felled species. Most species exhibited clumped dispersion of individuals both at 0.25ha and 1-ha scales. Variation in plant diversity and abundance are related to site attributes and human impacts.'

Abstract: 'Forest resource conservation has been widely accepted as a key to sustain the local and regional economic development. The forest edges are affected by anthropogenic activities including deforestation, forest fragmentation, selective logging, extraction of non-timber forest products, collection of medicinal plants, recreations, hydroelectric projects and its associated developmental activities, which alter the biodiversity. The present study intends to evaluate the edge effect on vegetation structure and species compositions in the tropical forest ecosystems at Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary in the Western Ghats. High species richness (number of species) and Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s diversity indices were observed in the site III (completely undisturbed forest) compared to site I (adjacent to the village/ edge of the forest, which is next to the teak plantation, severely disturbed forest) and site II (in between the undisturbed forest and moderately disturbed forest) while density of tree species showed greater value in site II. Single species such as Tectona grandis (IVI of 80) and Terminalia paniculata (IVI of 112) were the dominant tree species in site I and site II, respectively, whereas, in site III Terminalia bellirica, Bishofia javanica and Syzgium gardneri shared the dominance. Perturbation leads to alien plant invasion particularly Lantana camara, Eupatorium odoratum and Ageratum conizoides. Site II is at forest transition level because the site is dominated by both natural species as well as plantation species such as Tectona grandis. This site seems to be a buffer zone on natural forest and plantations. Further studies are required to analyse the real patterns of regeneration and dynamic change due to human impact by long term monitoring with the establishment of permanent plots.'

Abstract: 'Expansion of coffee cultivation is one of the causes of deforestation and biodiversity loss. However, shade grown coffee has been promoted as a means for preserving biodiversity in the tropics. In this study we compared tree diversity in two types of coffee management regimes with the sacred groves in the Western Ghats of India. We computed species accumulation curves, species diversity indices and evenness indices to compare the different management regimes. Results of diversity indices showed that shade coffee had less diversity compared to sacred groves. Exotic species dominated the tree diversity in lands where the tree harvesting rights are with the growers. Native trees dominated the tree diversity when growers had no ownership rights on trees. A species accumulation curve suggested that the sacred grove had higher species richness compared to other two habitats. Lack of incentive to preserve endemic species as shade trees is forcing growers to plant more exotic species in shade grown coffee plots. If encouraged, shade grown coffee can preserve some biodiversity, but cannot provide all ecological benefits of a natural forest.'

Abstract: 'This study highlights spatial characterization of evergreen forests of the Western Ghats \xe2\x80\x93 an ecological hotspot in Tamil Nadu, India \xe2\x80\x93 using remote sensing and GIS-based analysis in conjunction with ground-based phytosociological data. The evergreen forests of Tamil Nadu are distributed in four distinct hill ranges, Nilgiri, Anamalai, Palni and Tirunelveli, having different topographic, bioclimatic and disturbance levels. The evergreen forests in these four hill ranges are characterized for their uniqueness in terms of patch characteristics and phytosociology. A vegetation type map was prepared using IRS LISS III satellite data and was used to study the patch characteristics in terms of patch size, number, shape, porosity and landcover diversity (LD). The phytosociological characteristics, namely species richness, diversity, similarity and community assemblages, were studied using ground data collected from 95 sample points of 0.1 ha size. Patch size and number revealed distinct intactness and disturbance levels in these four hill ranges. Evergreen forests in the Tirunelveli hills comprising 216.09 km2 are distributed in 306 patches, and in the Palni hills, with 285 km2, forests are distributed in 1029 patches, indicating a high level of fragmentation. LD, indicating the spatial heterogeneity of landcover, was very high in the Nilgiri hills and low in the Tirunelveli hills. The spatial analysis helped to delineate homogenous large patches of evergreen forest, which can be adopted for appropriate conservation strategies. A total of 342 tree species belonging to 4490 stems were evaluated for phytosociology. Only 15\xe2\x80\x9328% of similarity in terms of species distribution was found across the hill ranges. Conjunctive analysis of patch characteristics and species distribution showed high species richness in less fragmented evergreen forests and vice versa. The study identified the areas of prioritization in terms of ecorestoration and conservation based on patch and phytosociological characteristics.'

Abstract: 'Ecologically sensitive regions (ESRs) are the \xe2\x80\x98ecological units\xe2\x80\x99 with the exceptional biotic and abiotic elements. Identification of ESRs considering spatially both ecological and social dimensions of environmental variables helps in ecological and conservation planning as per Biodiversity Act, 2002, Government of India. The current research attempts to integrate ecological and environmental considerations into administration, and prioritizes regions at Panchayat levels (local administrative unit) in Uttara Kannada district, Central Western Ghats, Karnataka state considering attributes (biological, Geo-climatic, Social, etc.) as ESR (1\xe2\x80\x934) through weightage score metrics. The region has the distinction of having highest forest area (80.48%) in Karnataka State, India and has been undergoing severe anthropogenic pressures impacting biogeochemistry, hydrology, food security, climate and socio-economic systems. Prioritisation of ESRs helps in the implementation of the sustainable developmental framework with the appropriate conservation strategies through the involvement of local stakeholders.'

Abstract: 'Fragmentation leads to the loss of connectivity among forested landscapes, which is important for biological conservation and biodiversity maintenance. Fragmentation analysis carried out on 20 years time interval in northern-Western Ghats revealed that, losses under moderate and high fragmented forests have decreased from 1985\xe2\x80\x9387 to 2005; however, it is not enough to compensate the loss of intact forests (not fragmented). The area of dense forests in intact forests has decreased from 1985\xe2\x80\x9387 to 2005, this essentially means the loss of quality habitat in the area. While investigating connectivity between fragmented patches by taking different topographical and ecological parameters into the consideration, it was observed that potential connectivity exists between protected areas present in northern and southern areas.'

Abstract: 'We analyze the structure and composition of old-growth wet evergreen forest of Nelliampathy hills, the chain of hills lying immediately south of Palghat Gap, in the southern Western Ghats of India. We sampled 30 plots of 0.1 ha each (50 m \xc3\x97 20 m) at six locations enumerating all plants \xe2\xa9\xbe 10 cm girth at breast height. We pooled the data and computed various structural parameters. There were 152 species of 120 genera and 51 families of the study area. Of these, 118 (77%) were trees, 24 were climbers (16%) and 10 were shrubs (7%). Species richness varied from 58\xe2\x80\x9399 per 0.5 ha sample and Shannon indices of diversity ranged from 4.4 to 5.2. Fifty-nine per cent (89 species) of the species were Indian Sub-continent elements and 34% (51 species) are endemic to the Western Ghats. Fifteen species are listed in various threat categories. Aglaia and Litsea were the most species-rich genera. Numbers of families ranged from 27\xe2\x80\x9343 per 0.5 ha sample. Euphorbiaceae and Lauraceae were the most species-rich families. Stand density varied from 1714 to 2244 stems\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 and basal area from 53.6 to 102.1 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921. The vegetation was dominated by 3\xe2\x80\x936 species and six dominance patterns characterized the species composition within the hill complex. The old-growth evergreen forests of Nelliampathy exist as small fragments rich in biodiversity and can be used as benchmarks for comparison with disturbed forests.'

Abstract: 'This article analyzes landscape pattern in the WesternGhats mountain ranges in south-western India at two scales,comparing small-scale, detailed studies of landscapepattern, with broader, regional-scale assessments of theWestern Ghats. Due in large part to their inaccessibility,relatively little is known about the landscapes of thisbiodiverse region, which also supports some of the highestpopulation densities in the world. A broad-scale NDVI-basedIRS 1B satellite image classification is used to analyzenorth-south and east-west trends across the entire WesternGhats and western coast of India, an area over 170 000 km2. Northern and eastern landscapes are morefragmented compared to the southern and western slopes.Western slopes also have greater landscape diversity withland cover types more interspersed compared to the easternslopes. These differences can be related to north-south andeast-west variations in rainfall and plant distribution. Data from thirteen landscapes 10\xe2\x80\x9350 km2 in area, arefurther utilized to analyze trends in landscape pattern, anddescribe the geographical distribution of major natural andmanaged ecotope types. At this scale, very high levels ofintra-ecotope type variability in landscape pattern areencountered for all land cover types. Results at these twoscales are integrated to suggest a hierarchical stratifiedapproach for monitoring land cover and biodiversity in the region.'

Abstract: 'We record here the occurrence of five exotic fish species viz Oreochromis mossambicus, Gambusia affinis, Osphronemus goramy, Xiphophorus maculatus and Poecilia reticulata in the Chalakudy River, part of the Western Ghats, a global biodiversity hotspot in Kerala, India. O. mossambicus was ubiquitous in occurrence with large shoals being encountered at all sampling sites spread along the downstream-upstream gradient of the river, including at an altitude of 1050\xc2\xa0m ASL. Osphronemus goramy was recorded from the downstream region of the river while Gambusia affinis was recorded from three sampling sites located downstream as well as midstream. Xiphophorus maculatus was collected from a second order stream flowing through a tea plantation at an altitude of 1050\xc2\xa0m ASL. Samples of brooders and early fry of Poecilia reticulata indicate that the fish has already established a breeding population in the river. Possible threats to the indigenous fish fauna of the Chalakudy River as a result of the invasion and proliferation of these exotics is discussed.'

Abstract: 'Seventy one fish species belonging to 27 families and 50 genera were collected from various sampling sites spread along the upstream and downstream parts of the Chalakudy river, in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in Kerala, South India. Cyprinids were the most dominant group represented by 24 species belonging to 13 genera, followed by the catfishes of the family Bagridae (7 species from 2 genera) and loaches belonging to the family Balitoridae (5 species from 5 genera). Of the 71 species, 4 belong to the \xe2\x80\x98critically endangered\xe2\x80\x99 (CR) and 16 to the \xe2\x80\x98endangered\xe2\x80\x99 (EN) category. 3 of the critically endangered species are strictly endemic to the Chalakudy river system. We also collected 5 exotic species several of them categorized as potential pest. Fish species richness (FSR) showed a direct relationship with increasing stream order with maximum values observed in the downstream/low elevation regions. Considerable differences were observed in the FSR between different microhabitats with maximum values observed in bed rock and pool riffle and the lowest in regimes followed by step pools. Diversity and species richness decreased with increasing altitude and higher diversity and species richness were observed in sampling sites located between 0\xe2\x80\x93200\xc2\xa0m above sea level. A definite temporal partitioning was also observed with regard to FSR with higher richness during the day time and the lowest observed at dawn. Indiscriminate collection of endemic and threatened ornamental fish species for export, exploitation of endangered food fishes by forest-dwelling communities and local fisher folk, pollution, loss of riparian cover, damming and exotic species threaten the rich ichthyofaunal diversity of Chalakudy River. An urgent need exists for studying the life history traits and demography of the most important endemic and threatened fishes, as lack of information on these aspects have significantly affected conservation efforts. The implementation of strong management strategies like fixing total allowable catch (TAC), and the use of quotas are needed to reduce the overall collection pressure with regard to the trade in native ornamental species from the river.'

Abstract: "High taxonomic level endemism in the Western Ghats-Sri Lanka biodiversity hotspot has been typically attributed to the subcontinent's geological history of long-term isolation. Subsequent out of \xe2\x80\x93 and into India dispersal of species after accretion to the Eurasian mainland is therefore often seen as a biogeographic factor that 'diluted' the composition of previously isolated Indian biota. However, few molecular studies have focussed on into-India dispersal as a possible source of endemism on the subcontinent. Using c. 6000 base pairs of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, we investigated the evolutionary history and biogeography of true toads (Bufonidae), a group that colonized the Indian Subcontinent after the Indo-Asia collision."

Abstract: 'A permanent plot of 30 ha (600 \xc3\x97 500 m2) was established for long-term ecological research on biodiversity and forest functioning in a tropical evergreen forest at Varagalaiar, Anamalais, Western Ghats. This paper gives the results of the first census of trees in the 30 ha plot. All trees \xe2\x89\xa530 cm gbh were permanently tagged with sequentially numbered aluminium tags and their girth measured. 148 tree species (in 120 genera and 49 families) were enumerated in a total sample of 13,393 individuals. Species diversity, density and dispersion patterns were determined. The mean species richness, density and basal area per hectare were 65 species, 446 stems and 36.26 m2 respectively. The Sorensen similarity index for thirty 1-ha subplots varied from 0.7 to 0.9, indicating the homogeneity in species composition of the stand. The pronounced species hierarchy has resulted in the dominance of four species that occupy four different forest storeys: Drypetes longifolia (lower storey) Reinwardtiodendron anamallayanum (middle storey), Poeciloneuron indicum (upper storey) and Dipterocarpus indicus (emergent). The forest was dominated by Euphorbiaceae in terms of richness (18 species) and abundance of species (3788 stems), and Dipterocarpaceae based on the contribution to basal area (18.4%). Species richness and density decreased with increasing girth-class. Girth class frequency of the stand exhibited an expanding population of trees. Twenty-nine tree species, analysed for spatial dispersion at 1-ha scale, exhibited both clumped and uniform patterns, except Vateria indica which was randomly distributed in one hectare. Repeat census scheduled for subsequent years, will elucidate the behaviour of the individual species and the population dynamics of the tree flora and will be useful for forest conservation and management. It will also help to monitor human activity within this forest.'

Abstract: 'Western Ghats are considered as one of the global biodiversity hotspots. There is an information gap on conservation status of the biodiversity hotspots. This study has quantified estimates of deforestation in the Western Ghats over a period of past nine decades. The classified forest cover maps for 1920, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013 indicates 95,446 (73.1%), 63,123 (48.4%), 62,286 (47.7%), 61,551 (47.2%), 61,511 (47.1%) and 61,511 km2 (47.1%) of the forest area, respectively. The rates of deforestation have been analyzed in different time phases, i.e., 1920\xe2\x80\x931975, 1975\xe2\x80\x931985, 1985\xe2\x80\x931995, 1995\xe2\x80\x932005 and 2005\xe2\x80\x932013. The grid cells of 1 km2 have been generated for time series analysis and describing spatial changes in forests. The net rate of deforestation was found to be 0.75 during 1920\xe2\x80\x931975, 0.13 during 1975\xe2\x80\x931985, 0.12 during 1985\xe2\x80\x931995 and 0.01 during 1995\xe2\x80\x932005. Overall forest loss in Western Ghats was estimated as 33,579 km2 (35.3% of the total forest) from 1920\xe2\x80\x99s to 2013. Land use change analysis indicates highest transformation of forest to plantations, followed by agriculture and degradation to scrub. The dominant forest type is tropical semi-evergreen which comprises 21,678 km2 (35.2%) of the total forest area of Western Ghats, followed by wet evergreen forest (30.6%), moist deciduous forest (24.8%) and dry deciduous forest (8.1%) in 2013. Even though it has the highest population density among the hotspots, there is no quantifiable net rate of deforestation from 2005 to 2013 which indicates increased measures of conservation.'

Abstract: 'DNA barcodes analyzed by using relevant techniques provide an imperative approach towards validation of prevailing taxa and putative species. Here, molecular methods were used for assessment of 246 barcodes belonging to 81 fish species from northern Western Ghats of India, using, Barcode gap analysis, barcode index number, automatic barcode gap discovery, Poisson tree processes and general mixed Yule-coalescent, these methods had their potential to discriminate 97.53%, 93.90% 95.06%, 93.82% and 92.59% of species respectively. But, some of them tended to estimate the inconsistent number of species leading to discrepancies between the morphological concept and inference from molecular phylogenetic reconstructions. So, we took a standard approach to recognize those methods that produced consistent results, three of five such methods were identified that revealed three hidden cryptic species complexes in Monopterus indicus, Parambassis ranga and Systomus sarana. Further, to validate these three genetically diverged species, we used diagnostic character based approach along with nine unidentified species through BLOG and WEKAs SMO classifier. Those methods were unable to identify these species, which might be due to the limited number of specimens used for the analysis. This is the first effort to generate the DNA barcode reference library of freshwater fishes from northern Western Ghats of India, one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biodiversity hotspots. These barcodes when analyzed through the defined workflow, will provide valuable measures to prove the efficiency of molecular species delimitation methods in taxonomic discrimination which aid conservation of biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Understanding of biodiversity on a local scale is extremely important for effective conservation measures, especially in biodiversity hotpsots hosting diverse endemic flora and fauna and subject to strong anthropogenic influences. Little is known about patterns of local biodiversity and the processes generating it in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot: the patterns of genetic diversity and biogeographic affinities are poorly known for most of the species from this region. We studied the genetic diversity and population structuring of an endemic frog Indirana cf beddomii, from 12 localities of Western Ghats using 15 polymorphic microsatellite loci. The genetic diversity as measured by mean expected heterozygosity (H E\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.83) or allelic richness (A r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa010.41) was high and similar in all localities. Significant genetic differentiation (mean F ST\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.075) with a strong pattern of isolation by distance (IBD) across the localities was observed. Clearest genetic discontinuities in the data corresponded to topographic gaps suggesting that apart from IBD, genetic structuring in this species is strongly influenced by habitat matrix. In general, the results provide novel insight into factors that may impact the genetic diversity and population structuring of endemic amphibians in this biodiversity hotspot.'

Abstract: 'Frogs in the genus Indirana are endemic to Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. The species are poorly studied and in many cases threatened or endangered. Here we describe primers and polymerase chain reactions for 62 microsatellite loci for Indirana beddomii, one of the commonest frogs in the genus. Fifty-six of the primers were polymorphic on sample of 23 individuals from a single sampling site (Ponmudi, Kerala) with an average 9.11 alleles per locus (range\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x9320). The average observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.64 and 0.71, respectively. The loci should be useful in conservation genetic studies of Indirana frogs.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity and ecosystem services play key roles in future economic strategies seeking to promote development and prosperity. This study assesses the status of biodiversity and flow of ecosystem services from selected forest types in the Western Ghats. At the sampling sites, the number of tree species ranged from 16 to 79 per hectare depending on the forest type. The estimates for Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Wiener index for trees in the evergreen, moist deciduous and dry deciduous forest plots were 3.02, 2.9 and 1.54, respectively. The total biomass carbon stocks in evergreen, moist deciduous and dry deciduous forests in the study area was 229, 221 and 189\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0C/ha, respectively. Analysis of dependency patterns of local communities on forest resources indicated a high dependency on provisional services such as fuelwood, manure and fodder. The study records the highest dependency rates for fuelwood, ranging between 72 and 100% for the three forest types and indicates that forest ecosystems underpin the well-being of the population dependent directly and indirectly on them.'

Abstract: 'Improved understanding of the processes shaping the assembly of tropical tree communities is crucial for gaining insights into the evolution of forest communities and biological diversity. The climate is thought to be the first order determinant of abundance and distribution patterns of tree species with contrasting traits such as evergreen and deciduous leaf phenology. However, the relative role of neutral, and niche-based processes in the evolution of these patterns remain poorly understood.'

Abstract: 'Earth Observation with large suite of sensors and with capabilities to address natural resources at multiple scales has proven to be a critical resource in setting conservation priorities of a region. The role of earth observation data was recognized towards achieving international biodiversity targets by 2020. Ecosystem irreplaceability and ecosystem vulnerability are two concepts key to understanding and preparing conservation priority maps. This study presents spatial conservation prioritization analysis for forests of \xe2\x80\x98Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot\xe2\x80\x99. Earth observation data products have been used for prioritization of areas of irreplaceability and vulnerability that are significant for conservation planning. The spatial surrogates of biodiversity in terms of very dense forest, biological richness, intactness and rarity of habitat are analyzed for evaluation of ecosystem irreplaceability. Fragmentation, forest fires, plant invasion and disturbance index are surrogates included for spatial analysis of ecosystem vulnerability. Vegetation type wise analysis indicates dry deciduous forests are under high vulnerability, followed by moist deciduous forests. The high concentration of irreplaceability is observed in Shola followed by wet evergreen forests and semi-evergreen forests. Spatial prioritization approach has identified about 18% of the forest area as irreplaceable which represents overlapped area of very dense forest, shola, intact forest and high biological richness. We observed that the overlap of forest areas of irreplaceability with vulnerability in southern Western Ghats, which needs high priority of conservation. This study is the first of its kind wherein multi-source earth observation data has been analysed to examine the quantitative criteria at regional level in Western Ghats.'

Abstract: 'Species diversity, density, population structure and dispersion patterns of all trees and lianas (\xe2\x89\xa530cm gbh) were inventoried in a tropical semi-evergreen forest in the Shervarayan hills of Eastern Ghats, south India. Such data are necessary for ecosystem conservation of the under-studied Eastern Ghats, as extensive forests here have already been converted to coffee and orange plantations and the landscape changed due to aluminium ore mining and quarrying. Four 1-ha plots were established in Sanyasimalai (SM) reserve forest of the Shervarayan hills, one plot (SM1) located close to mining and quarrying area, two other contiguous plots (SM2 and SM3) located in selective felling area and the fourth (SM4) in a relatively undisturbed forest. These are 1 to 4km apart in the same semi-evergreen forest tract. In the four study plots a total of 3260 stems (mean density 815ha\xe2\x88\x921) covering 80 species in 71 genera and 44 plant families were recorded. Species richness was greatest in the undisturbed plot SM4 (50), while lowest (33) in the selectively felled site SM2. The forest stand (SM4) was also denser (986 stemsha\xe2\x88\x921) and more voluminous (basal area 44.3m2ha\xe2\x88\x921 as compared with the site mean of 35m2ha\xe2\x88\x921) than the other plots. Four trees, Chionanthus paniculata, Syzygium cumini, Canthium dicoccum and Ligustrum perrottetii dominated the stand, collectively contributing to >50% of the total density. Species richness and stand density decreased with increasing tree girths. The forest stand contained a growing population, but there was considerable variation in basal area distribution between the plots. Trends in species population structure varied, particularly for selective-felled species. Most species exhibited clumped dispersion of individuals both at 0.25ha and 1-ha scales. Variation in plant diversity and abundance are related to site attributes and human impacts.'

Abstract: 'Forest resource conservation has been widely accepted as a key to sustain the local and regional economic development. The forest edges are affected by anthropogenic activities including deforestation, forest fragmentation, selective logging, extraction of non-timber forest products, collection of medicinal plants, recreations, hydroelectric projects and its associated developmental activities, which alter the biodiversity. The present study intends to evaluate the edge effect on vegetation structure and species compositions in the tropical forest ecosystems at Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary in the Western Ghats. High species richness (number of species) and Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s diversity indices were observed in the site III (completely undisturbed forest) compared to site I (adjacent to the village/ edge of the forest, which is next to the teak plantation, severely disturbed forest) and site II (in between the undisturbed forest and moderately disturbed forest) while density of tree species showed greater value in site II. Single species such as Tectona grandis (IVI of 80) and Terminalia paniculata (IVI of 112) were the dominant tree species in site I and site II, respectively, whereas, in site III Terminalia bellirica, Bishofia javanica and Syzgium gardneri shared the dominance. Perturbation leads to alien plant invasion particularly Lantana camara, Eupatorium odoratum and Ageratum conizoides. Site II is at forest transition level because the site is dominated by both natural species as well as plantation species such as Tectona grandis. This site seems to be a buffer zone on natural forest and plantations. Further studies are required to analyse the real patterns of regeneration and dynamic change due to human impact by long term monitoring with the establishment of permanent plots.'

Abstract: 'Expansion of coffee cultivation is one of the causes of deforestation and biodiversity loss. However, shade grown coffee has been promoted as a means for preserving biodiversity in the tropics. In this study we compared tree diversity in two types of coffee management regimes with the sacred groves in the Western Ghats of India. We computed species accumulation curves, species diversity indices and evenness indices to compare the different management regimes. Results of diversity indices showed that shade coffee had less diversity compared to sacred groves. Exotic species dominated the tree diversity in lands where the tree harvesting rights are with the growers. Native trees dominated the tree diversity when growers had no ownership rights on trees. A species accumulation curve suggested that the sacred grove had higher species richness compared to other two habitats. Lack of incentive to preserve endemic species as shade trees is forcing growers to plant more exotic species in shade grown coffee plots. If encouraged, shade grown coffee can preserve some biodiversity, but cannot provide all ecological benefits of a natural forest.'

Abstract: 'This study highlights spatial characterization of evergreen forests of the Western Ghats \xe2\x80\x93 an ecological hotspot in Tamil Nadu, India \xe2\x80\x93 using remote sensing and GIS-based analysis in conjunction with ground-based phytosociological data. The evergreen forests of Tamil Nadu are distributed in four distinct hill ranges, Nilgiri, Anamalai, Palni and Tirunelveli, having different topographic, bioclimatic and disturbance levels. The evergreen forests in these four hill ranges are characterized for their uniqueness in terms of patch characteristics and phytosociology. A vegetation type map was prepared using IRS LISS III satellite data and was used to study the patch characteristics in terms of patch size, number, shape, porosity and landcover diversity (LD). The phytosociological characteristics, namely species richness, diversity, similarity and community assemblages, were studied using ground data collected from 95 sample points of 0.1 ha size. Patch size and number revealed distinct intactness and disturbance levels in these four hill ranges. Evergreen forests in the Tirunelveli hills comprising 216.09 km2 are distributed in 306 patches, and in the Palni hills, with 285 km2, forests are distributed in 1029 patches, indicating a high level of fragmentation. LD, indicating the spatial heterogeneity of landcover, was very high in the Nilgiri hills and low in the Tirunelveli hills. The spatial analysis helped to delineate homogenous large patches of evergreen forest, which can be adopted for appropriate conservation strategies. A total of 342 tree species belonging to 4490 stems were evaluated for phytosociology. Only 15\xe2\x80\x9328% of similarity in terms of species distribution was found across the hill ranges. Conjunctive analysis of patch characteristics and species distribution showed high species richness in less fragmented evergreen forests and vice versa. The study identified the areas of prioritization in terms of ecorestoration and conservation based on patch and phytosociological characteristics.'

Abstract: 'Ecologically sensitive regions (ESRs) are the \xe2\x80\x98ecological units\xe2\x80\x99 with the exceptional biotic and abiotic elements. Identification of ESRs considering spatially both ecological and social dimensions of environmental variables helps in ecological and conservation planning as per Biodiversity Act, 2002, Government of India. The current research attempts to integrate ecological and environmental considerations into administration, and prioritizes regions at Panchayat levels (local administrative unit) in Uttara Kannada district, Central Western Ghats, Karnataka state considering attributes (biological, Geo-climatic, Social, etc.) as ESR (1\xe2\x80\x934) through weightage score metrics. The region has the distinction of having highest forest area (80.48%) in Karnataka State, India and has been undergoing severe anthropogenic pressures impacting biogeochemistry, hydrology, food security, climate and socio-economic systems. Prioritisation of ESRs helps in the implementation of the sustainable developmental framework with the appropriate conservation strategies through the involvement of local stakeholders.'

Abstract: 'Fragmentation leads to the loss of connectivity among forested landscapes, which is important for biological conservation and biodiversity maintenance. Fragmentation analysis carried out on 20 years time interval in northern-Western Ghats revealed that, losses under moderate and high fragmented forests have decreased from 1985\xe2\x80\x9387 to 2005; however, it is not enough to compensate the loss of intact forests (not fragmented). The area of dense forests in intact forests has decreased from 1985\xe2\x80\x9387 to 2005, this essentially means the loss of quality habitat in the area. While investigating connectivity between fragmented patches by taking different topographical and ecological parameters into the consideration, it was observed that potential connectivity exists between protected areas present in northern and southern areas.'

Abstract: 'We analyze the structure and composition of old-growth wet evergreen forest of Nelliampathy hills, the chain of hills lying immediately south of Palghat Gap, in the southern Western Ghats of India. We sampled 30 plots of 0.1 ha each (50 m \xc3\x97 20 m) at six locations enumerating all plants \xe2\xa9\xbe 10 cm girth at breast height. We pooled the data and computed various structural parameters. There were 152 species of 120 genera and 51 families of the study area. Of these, 118 (77%) were trees, 24 were climbers (16%) and 10 were shrubs (7%). Species richness varied from 58\xe2\x80\x9399 per 0.5 ha sample and Shannon indices of diversity ranged from 4.4 to 5.2. Fifty-nine per cent (89 species) of the species were Indian Sub-continent elements and 34% (51 species) are endemic to the Western Ghats. Fifteen species are listed in various threat categories. Aglaia and Litsea were the most species-rich genera. Numbers of families ranged from 27\xe2\x80\x9343 per 0.5 ha sample. Euphorbiaceae and Lauraceae were the most species-rich families. Stand density varied from 1714 to 2244 stems\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 and basal area from 53.6 to 102.1 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921. The vegetation was dominated by 3\xe2\x80\x936 species and six dominance patterns characterized the species composition within the hill complex. The old-growth evergreen forests of Nelliampathy exist as small fragments rich in biodiversity and can be used as benchmarks for comparison with disturbed forests.'

Abstract: 'This article analyzes landscape pattern in the WesternGhats mountain ranges in south-western India at two scales,comparing small-scale, detailed studies of landscapepattern, with broader, regional-scale assessments of theWestern Ghats. Due in large part to their inaccessibility,relatively little is known about the landscapes of thisbiodiverse region, which also supports some of the highestpopulation densities in the world. A broad-scale NDVI-basedIRS 1B satellite image classification is used to analyzenorth-south and east-west trends across the entire WesternGhats and western coast of India, an area over 170 000 km2. Northern and eastern landscapes are morefragmented compared to the southern and western slopes.Western slopes also have greater landscape diversity withland cover types more interspersed compared to the easternslopes. These differences can be related to north-south andeast-west variations in rainfall and plant distribution. Data from thirteen landscapes 10\xe2\x80\x9350 km2 in area, arefurther utilized to analyze trends in landscape pattern, anddescribe the geographical distribution of major natural andmanaged ecotope types. At this scale, very high levels ofintra-ecotope type variability in landscape pattern areencountered for all land cover types. Results at these twoscales are integrated to suggest a hierarchical stratifiedapproach for monitoring land cover and biodiversity in the region.'

Abstract: 'Equatorial rain forests that maintain a balance between speciation and extinction are hot-spots for studies of biodiversity. Western Ghats in southern India have gained attention due to high tropical biodiversity and endemism in their southern most area. We attempted to track the affinities of the pollen flora of the endemic plants of Western Ghat area within the fossil palynoflora of late Palaeocene-early Eocene (\xe2\x88\xbc55\xe2\x80\x9350 Ma) sedimentary deposits of western and northeastern Indian region. The study shows striking similarity of extant pollen with twenty eight most common fossil pollen taxa of the early Palaeogene. Widespread occurrences of coal and lignite deposits during early Palaeogene provide evidence of existence of well diversified rain forest community and swampy vegetation in the coastal low lying areas all along the western and northeastern margins of the Indian subcontinent. Prevalence of excessive humid climate during this period has been seen as a result of equatorial positioning of Indian subcontinent, superimposed by a long term global warming phase (PETM and EECO) during the early Palaeogene. The study presents clear evidence that highly diversified equatorial rain forest vegetation once widespread in the Indian subcontinent during early Palaeogene times, are now restricted in a small area as a refugia in the southernmost part of the Western Ghat area. High precipitation and shorter periods of dry months seem to have provided suitable environment to sustain lineages of ancient tropical vegetation in this area of Western Ghats in spite of dramatic climatic changes subsequent to the post India-Asia collision and during the Quaternary and Recent times.'

Abstract: 'In this brief report, the relative importance of different climatic variables on structuring the spatial richness patterns of endemic tree species are quantified for Western Ghats of India, a biodiversity hotspot of the world. Path analysis and spatial multiple regression analysis are employed to measure the relative impacts of different climatic variables on the richness of tree species. Four climatic predictors, annual mean temperature (TEM), annual mean precipitation (PREC), annual evapotranspiration (AET), and elevation range (TOPO), are used to represent different perspectives of climatic variability. TEM represents temperature tolerance, PREC water availability, AET energy and TOPO habitat heterogeneity. Results show that, without removing spatial autocorrelation, AET is the most influential variable. However, the effect of AET was detected to be an artifact of spatial autocorrelation and after controlling such a misleading effect using simultaneous autoregressive models, the effects of other variables became evident and important in explaining the richness of endemic trees. All the statistical models consistently identified that TOPO and PREC are the equally influential variables for structuring richness patterns of endemic trees in Western Ghats. In conclusion, habitat heterogeneity and water availability are the most important predictors of richness in tropical endemic tree communities in Western Ghats.'

Title: 'Assessment of inherent vulnerability of forests at landscape level: a case study from Western Ghats in India'

Abstract: 'Assessment of vulnerability is an important step in building long-term resilience in the forestry sector. The objective of this paper is to present a methodological approach to assess inherent vulnerability of forests at landscape level. The approach involves use of vulnerability indicators, the pairwise comparison method, and geographic information system (GIS) tools. We apply this approach to assess the inherent vulnerability of forests of the Western Ghats Karnataka (WGK) landscape, which is a part of the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in India. Four vulnerability indicators, namely biological richness, disturbance index, canopy cover, and slope, are selected. We find that forests in 30, 36, 19, and 15\xc2\xa0% grid points in this region show low, medium, high, and very high inherent vulnerability, respectively. The forest showing high and very high inherent vulnerability are mostly dry deciduous forests and plantations located largely on the eastern side of the landscape. We also find that canopy cover is one of the key indicators that determine the inherent vulnerability of forests, and natural forests are inherently less vulnerable than man-made plantations. Spatial assessment of inherent vulnerability of forests at landscape level is particularly useful for developing strategies to build resilience to current stressors and climate change in future.'

Title: 'Evaluating forest fragmentation and its tree community composition in the tropical rain forest of Southern Western Ghats (India) from 1973 to 2004'

Abstract: 'A majority of the research on forest fragmentation is primarily focused on animal groups rather than on tree communities because of the complex structural and functional behavior of the latter. In this study, we show that forest fragmentation provokes surprisingly rapid and profound alterations in tropical tree community. We examine forest fragments in the tropical region using high-resolution satellite imagery taken between 1973 and 2004 in the Southern Western Ghats (India) in relation to landscape patterns and phytosociological datasets. We have distinguished fragmentation in six categories\xe2\x80\x94interior, perforated, edge, transitional, patch, and undetermined\xe2\x80\x94around each forested pixel. Furthermore, we have characterized each of the fragment class in the evergreen and semi-evergreen forest in terms of its species composition and richness, its species similarity and abundance, and its regeneration status. Different landscape metrics have been used to infer patterns of land-use changes. Contiguous patches of >1,000\xc2\xa0ha covered 90% of evergreen forest in 1973 with less porosity and minimal plantation and anthropogenic pressures; whereas in 2004, the area had 67% forest coverage and a high level of porosity, possibly due to Ochlandra spread and increased plantations which resulted in the loss of such contiguous patches. Results highlight the importance of landscape metrics in monitoring land-cover change over time. Our main conclusion was to develop an approach, which combines information regarding land cover, degree of fragmentation, and phytosociological inputs, to conserve and prioritize tropical ecosystems.'

Title: 'Agroforestry in the Western Ghats of peninsular India and the satoyama landscapes of Japan: a comparison of two sustainable land use systems'

Abstract: 'Agroforestry in the Western Ghats (WG) of peninsular India and satoyama in rural Japan are traditional land-use systems with similar evolutionary trajectories. Some of their relevance was lost by the middle of the twentieth century, when modern agricultural technologies and urbanisation engineered shifts in emphasis towards maximising crop production. There has been, however, a resurgence of interest in traditional land-use systems recently, in view of their ability to provide ecosystem services. Both agroforestry and satoyama are thought to be harbingers of biological diversity and have the potential to serve as \xe2\x80\x9ccarbon forests.\xe2\x80\x9d Carbon (C) stock estimates of the sampled homegardens in WG ranged from 16 to 36\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. Satoyama woodlands owing to variations in tree stocking and management conditions indicated widely varying C stocks (2\xe2\x80\x93279\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921). Agroforestry and satoyama also differ in nature, complexity, and objectives. While agroforestry involves key productive and protective functions, and adopts \xe2\x80\x98intensive management\xe2\x80\x99, the satoyama woodlands are extensively managed; understorey production is seldom a consideration. Differences in canopy architecture (multi-tiered structure of agroforestry vs. the more or less unitary canopy of satoayama) and land ownership pattern (privately owned/managed agroforestry holdings vs. community or local government or privately owned and mostly abandoned satoyamas) pose other challenges in the transfer and application of knowledge gained in one system to the other. Nonetheless, lessons learnt from satoyama conservation may be suitable for common pool resource management elsewhere in Asia, and aspects relating to understorey production in agroforestry may be relevant for satoyama under certain scenarios.'

Abstract: '\nCoffee agroforestry is a conservation strategy that has shown promise to support the diversity of bird, bat, and insect communities, but few studies have focused on non-volant mammals in coffee farms. We assessed mammal diversity within coffee agroforestry systems in Kodagu, India and investigated the impacts of the non-native shade tree species, Grevillea robusta, on mammal diversity. Twenty farms, with varying amounts of G. robusta planted within the coffee farm, were sampled throughout three rainfall zones during the 4-month study period. We captured six species of small mammals, with indirect methods yielding an additional five species, totaling 11\xc2\xa0mammal species. Contrary to current ecological thought, we found that increased amounts of G. robusta did not have a negative impact on either abundance or richness of mammals. Small mammal abundances were higher at farms with greater amounts of herbaceous ground cover and larger, mature shade trees, while small mammal species richness was found to increase with an increase in tree species richness as well as greater amounts of herbaceous ground cover. Additionally, small mammal abundance was higher at coffee farms closer to forested areas. Based on these findings, we suggest the maintenance or cultivation of shade tree richness, mature shade trees, and herbaceous ground cover within coffee farms and preservation of forested areas within the landscape to enhance coffee agroforestry habitat for non-volant mammals. We hope that these habitat requirements will be incorporated into conservation strategies for the promotion of biodiversity within coffee agroforestry systems.'

Abstract: 'Within a 30-ha permanent plot of a tropical evergreen forest in the Anamalais, Indian Western Ghats, all the 13\xe2\x80\x89415 trees \xe2\x89\xa530\xe2\x80\x89cm\xe2\x80\x89gbh (belonging to 153 species) were identified and tagged during 1997\xe2\x80\x931998. This communication reports the results of tree population changes based on two annual censuses (1999 and 2000) of the plot after the initial census, and compares the results with other tropical forest sites. One species, Ficus beddomei, disappeared from the plot and there was no new addition of species. Of the 96 species that showed changes in their population density, for 12 species recruitment and mortality matched. Tree recruitment (5 trees\xe2\x80\x89ha\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\x89year\xe2\x88\x921) exceeded mortality (4 trees\xe2\x80\x89ha\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\x89year\xe2\x88\x921) during the two-year period. Four modes of tree deaths were recorded in our site. The per cent mortality of trees differed between tree size classes during each recensus. The plot tree density increased progressively in the two-year period, indicating that shifts in species composition and density in natural forests, without major catastrophic disturbance, occur slowly.'

Abstract: 'Contrary to expectations, some human-modified landscapes are considered to sustain both human activities and biodiversity over the long-term. Agroforestry systems are among these landscapes where crops are planted under native shade trees. In this context, ancient agroforestry systems can provide insight into how farmers managed the landscape over time. Such insight can help to quantify the extent to which tropical forests (especially habitat-specialist trees) are responding to local and landscape-level management. Here, we extracted fossil pollen (indicator of past vegetation changes) and macroscopic charcoal (indicator of biomass burning) from four forest hollows\xe2\x80\x99 sedimentary sequences in an ancient agroforestry system in Western Ghats, India. We used a mixed-modelling approach and a principal components analysis (PCA) to determine past trajectories of forest change and species composition dynamics for the last 900\xc2\xa0years. In addition, we reconstructed the long-term forest canopy dynamics and examined the persistence of habitat-specialist trees over time. Our results show that the four sites diverged to a surprising degree in both taxa composition and dynamics. However, despite these differences, forest has persisted over 900\xc2\xa0years under agricultural activities within agroforestry systems. This long-term analysis highlights the importance of different land-use legacies as a framework to increase the effectiveness of management across tropical agricultural lands.'

Abstract: 'The composition, abundance, population structure and distribution patterns of all woody species (\xe2\x89\xa5 30 cm gbh) were investigated in an undisturbed and two adjacent human-impacted sites of a tropical wet evergreen forest in Kalakad National Park, Western Ghats, south India. Three 1-ha plots were established, one each in (i) an undisturbed site (named site UD), (ii) in a site selectively felled 35 years ago (site SF \xe2\x80\x93 small stems felled leaving the large trees (as shade) for developing it into a cardamom estate, on the failure of which the site was abandoned) and (iii) a frequently disturbed site (site FD \xe2\x80\x93 round woods logged for use in ovens for curing cardamom). These sites are 1 to 3 km apart in the same wet evergreen forest. In the three study plots a total of 2150 stems (mean density 716 ha\xe2\x88\x921) covering 122 species in 89 genera and 41 families were enumerated. Species richness was greatest (85 species ha\xe2\x88\x921) in the undisturbed site UD, intermediate (83) in SF and lowest (80) in FD. Tree density was greatest (855 stems ha\xe2\x88\x921) in site SF, intermediate (720) in UD and lowest (575) in FD. The forest stand was exceptionally voluminous in site UD (basal area 94.64 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921), intermediate (66.9 m2) in SF and least (61.7 m2) in FD, due to tree removal for fuel in the latter sites. Species composition and abundance patterns markedly varied between the three sites. In UD and SF, primary forest species (Cryptocarya bourdillonii , Cullenia exarillata Myristica dactyloides etc.) occurred in greater density. In FD heliophilic secondary forest species (Elaeocarpus venustus, Litsea wightiana, Viburnum punctatum and Vitex altissima) were abundant, while these were absent in UD and SF. The species\xe2\x80\x93area curve did not reach an asymptote in any of the sites on the 1-ha scale. The stand population structure was clearly reverse \xe2\x80\x98J\xe2\x80\x99 shaped in UD and SF, while small stems were 2- to 3-fold fewer in FD. Most trees exhibited clumped distribution of individuals on the 1-ha scale. Variation in the kind and richness of species and their abundance is related to human interference and the need for forest conservation is emphasized.'

Abstract: 'As large nature reserves occupy only a fraction of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s land surface, conservation biologists are critically examining the role of private lands, habitat fragments, and plantations for conservation. This study in a biodiversity hotspot and endemic bird area, the Western Ghats mountains of India, examined the effects of habitat structure, floristics, and adjacent habitats on bird communities in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and tropical rainforest fragments. Habitat and birds were sampled in 13 sites: six fragments (three relatively isolated and three with canopy connectivity with adjoining shade-coffee plantations and forests), six plantations differing in canopy tree species composition (five coffee and one cardamom), and one undisturbed primary rainforest control site in the Anamalai hills. Around 3300 detections of 6000 individual birds belonging to 106 species were obtained. The coffee plantations were poorer than rainforest in rainforest bird species, particularly endemic species, but the rustic cardamom plantation with diverse, native rainforest shade trees, had bird species richness and abundance comparable to primary rainforest. Plantations and fragments that adjoined habitats providing greater tree canopy connectivity supported more rainforest and fewer open-forest bird species and individuals than sites that lacked such connectivity. These effects were mediated by strong positive effects of vegetation structure, particularly woody plant variables, cane, and bamboo, on bird community structure. Bird community composition was however positively correlated only to floristic (tree species) composition of sites. The maintenance or restoration of habitat structure and (shade) tree species composition in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and rainforest fragments can aid in rainforest bird conservation in the regional landscape.'

Abstract: 'Forty-five species of wild edible fruits were identified and traditional local knowledge of their usage was recorded in 40 villages of Kodagu district in Central Western Ghats, India one of the eight top hotspots of biodiversity in the world. We combined biodiversity inventory of trees with village interviews to record traditional ecological knowledge. Wild edible fruits were an opportunistic source of food for rural people. Wild edible fruits were rich in minerals, vitamins, carbohydrates, proteins, fats and fiber. In recent years there has been a decline in numbers of wild fruit trees due to changes in land use from uncultivated private wooded area to cardamom and coffee cultivation. The availability of wild edible fruits that were once very common on private cultivated areas has declined and their distributions are now restricted more to jungles and wildlife sanctuaries. We propose methods for conservation and describe the need for sustainable utilization to provide supplementary sources of nutritional and pharmaceutically useful edible wild fruits.'

Abstract: 'The objective of this study is to present a methodological approach to assess the inherent vulnerability of forests and apply it to a case study. Addressing inherent vulnerability, resulting from current stresses, is a necessary step for building resilience to long-term climate change. The proposed approach includes use of analytical framework that enables selection of vulnerability criteria and indicators systematically, application of pairwise comparison method (PCM) for assigning weights, and synthesis of a composite vulnerability index. This methodological approach has been applied at local scale to Aduvalli Protected Forest in Western Ghats in South India, where a vulnerability index value of 0.248 is estimated. Results of the case study indicate that \xe2\x80\x98preponderance of invasive species\xe2\x80\x99 and forest dependence of community are the major sources of vulnerability at present for Aduvalli Protected Forest. Adoption of this methodology can assist in development of forest management plans to enhance adaptability of Aduvalli PF to current as well as future stresses, including climate change. This methodological approach can be applied across forest-types after appropriate changes to criteria and indicators and their weights, to estimate the inherent vulnerability to enable development of adaptation strategy.'

Abstract: 'Conservation initiatives are designed to address threats to forests and biodiversity, often through partnerships with natural-resource users who are incentivized to change their land-use and livelihood practices to avoid further biodiversity loss. In particular, direct incentives programmes that provide monetary benefits are commended for being effective in achieving conservation across short timescales. In biodiversity-rich areas, outside protected areas, such as coffee agroforestry systems, direct incentives, such as certification schemes, are used to motivate coffee producers to maintain native tree species, natural vegetation, restrict wildlife hunting, and conserve soil and water, in addition to encouraging welfare of workers. However, despite these claims, there is a lack of strong evidence of the on-ground impact of such schemes. To assess the conservation importance of certification, we describe a case study in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot of India, in which coffee growers are provided price incentives to adopt Rainforest Alliance certification standards. We analyse the conservation and social outcomes of this programme by studying peoples\xe2\x80\x99 experiences of participating in certification. Despite high compliance and effective implementation, we find a strong case for the endorsement of \xe2\x80\x98business as usual\xe2\x80\x99 with no changes in farm management as a result of certification. We find that such \xe2\x80\x98business as usual\xe2\x80\x99 participation in certification creates grounds for diminishing credibility and local support for conservation efforts. Working towards locally relevant conservation interventions, rather than implementing global blueprints, may lead to more meaningful biodiversity conservation and increased community support for conservation initiatives in coffee landscapes.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity and environmental conservation is important for today\xe2\x80\x99s critically degraded environment, so strategies must be developed using protected area networks such as biosphere reserves, wildlife sanctuaries and national parks. Kalakad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve is such a valuable repository of floral and faunal biodiversity in the southern Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India, both in terms of species richness and endemism. A survey was carried out from September 2004 to June 2006 to assess the conservation status of medicinal plants which are used by the tribal people inhabiting the periphery of the reserve. More than 350 species of ethnomedicinal plants were recorded in the study with the association of tribal practitioners. Out of them, the ethnomedicinal plants Aglaia lawii, Arenga wightii, Chloroxylon swietenia, Eugenia singampattiana, Kingiodendron pinnatum, Orophea thomsonii, Polyalthia rufescens, Pterocarpus marsupium and Santalum album are \xe2\x80\x98Red Listed\xe2\x80\x99 plants. The majority of the plants of the reserve are rapidly getting threatened, because of the natural calamities and anthropogenic activities inside the forest areas. Thus, the reserve has high conservation value and its biodiversity is vulnerable to different factors so its conservation should receive great attention by involving the local communities and forest representatives.'

Abstract: 'Decades of commercial planting and other anthropogenic processes are posing a threat to the riparian landscapes of the Cauvery river basin, which supports a high floral diversity. Despite this, the habitats in the upstream sections of the River Cauvery are still intact, as they are located in sacred groves. To understand the dynamism of riparian forests exposed to anthropogenic pressures, the upstream stretch of Cauvery extending from Kushalanagara to Talacauvery (\xe2\x88\xbc102 km) was categorized into two landscapes: agro ecosystem and sacred (i.e. preserved). The tree species were sampled using belt transects at 5 km intervals and the regeneration status of endemic species assessed using quadrats. A total of 128 species belonging to 47 families, and representing 1,590 individuals, was observed. Amongst them, 65% of unique species were exclusive to sacred landscapes. A rarefaction plot confirmed higher species richness for the sacred compared to the agro ecosystem landscapes, and diversity indices with more evenness in distribution were evident in sacred landscapes. A significant loss of endemic tree species in the agro ecosystem landscapes was found. Overall, this study demonstrates that an intense biotic pressure in terms of plantations and other anthropogenic activities have altered the species composition of the riparian zone in non-sacred areas. A permanent policy implication is required for the conservation of riparian buffers to avoid further ecosystem degradation and loss of biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation in the biosphere reserves, which are key Protected Areas has negative impacts on biodiversity, climate, carbon fluxes and livelihoods. Comprehensive study of deforestation in biosphere reserves is required to assess the impact of the management effectiveness. This article assesses the changes in forest cover in various zones and protected areas of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the first declared biosphere reserve in India which forms part of Western Ghats-a global biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we have mapped the forests from earliest available topographical maps and multi-temporal satellite data spanning from 1920\xe2\x80\x99s to 2012 period. Mapping of spatial extent of forest cover, vegetation types and land cover was carried out using visual interpretation technique. A grid cell of 1\xc2\xa0km\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x891\xc2\xa0km was generated for time series change analysis to understand the patterns in spatial distribution of forest cover (1920\xe2\x80\x931973\xe2\x80\x931989\xe2\x80\x931999\xe2\x80\x932006\xe2\x80\x932012). The total forest area of biosphere reserve was found to be 5,806.5\xc2\xa0km2 (93.8\xc2\xa0% of total geographical area) in 1920. Overall loss of forest cover was estimated as 1,423.6\xc2\xa0km2 (24.5\xc2\xa0% of the total forest) with reference to 1920. Among the six Protected Areas, annual deforestation rate of >0.5 was found in Wayanad wildlife sanctuary during 1920\xe2\x80\x931973. The deforestation in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve is mainly attributed to conversion of forests to plantations and agriculture along with submergence due to construction of dams during 1920 to 1989. Grid wise analysis indicates that 851 grids have undergone large-scale negative changes of >75\xc2\xa0ha of forest loss during 1920\xe2\x80\x931973 while, only 15 grids have shown >75\xc2\xa0ha loss during 1973\xe2\x80\x931989. Annual net rate of deforestation for the period of 1920 to 1973 was calculated as 0.5 followed by 0.1 for 1973 to 1989. Our analysis shows that there was large-scale deforestation before the declaration of area as biosphere reserve in 1986; however, the deforestation has drastically reduced after the declaration due to high degree of protection, thus indicating the secure future of reserve in the long term under the current forest management practices. The present work will stand as the most up-to-date assessment on the forest cover of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve with immediate applications in monitoring and management of forest biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'The Western Ghats of India is the one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s 10 \xe2\x80\x9cHottest biodiversity hotspots\xe2\x80\x9d that runs along the western part of India through four states including Tamil Nadu. The only biodiversity reserve in the Western Ghats is the Nilgiri biosphere located in the Tamil Nadu state. In the present study, 525 soil samples were collected from all the 14 different divisions of the Western Ghats in Tamil Nadu state, India. A total of 316 new isolates of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that produce parasporal crystalline inclusions were isolated from 525 soil samples. Seven different types of crystalline inclusions were observed in the 316 new isolates of Bt. Cuboidal inclusion was predominantly present in 26.9% of the Bt isolates when compared to other shapes. Further characterization of 70 of the 316 Bt isolates for crystal protein profile through SDS-PAGE revealed six different types of crystal protein profile viz., 135 and 65, 135, 95, 65, 43, and 30\xc2\xa0kDa crystal proteins. Variation in the mass of crystal protein(s) purified from the isolates of Bt revealed molecular diversity of this bacterium prevalent in the Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India.'

Abstract: 'Changes in tree and understory plant diversity and community composition in two sites at different disturbance levels were studied on the Anaikatty hills, Western Ghats. Systematic sampling using small scale permanent quadrates (50 \xc3\x97 20\xc2\xa0m for trees, 5 \xc3\x97 5\xc2\xa0m for shrubs/saplings, 1 \xc3\x97 1\xc2\xa0m for herbs/seedlings) enumerated 3,376 individuals of trees (106 species), 8,599 of individuals shrubs (122 species) and 16,659 individuals of herbs (145 species). Among the two sites, species richness and diversity were highest for low disturbed stand (98 and 3.9, respectively) compared to high disturbed site (45 and 2.71, respectively). Result of cluster analysis showed that two distinct clusters were formed on the basis of disturbance of the area in concordance with our field observation. A total of 37 species were common to both sites, sixty one species exclusively found in low disturbed site and eight species were pertained to highly disturbed site. Mann\xe2\x80\x93Whitney test based on Monte Carlo approximation at 95% confidence levels indicated that both populations were not entirely different. The clear difference was only observed for average basal area of trees, density of seedlings, number of species, density and diversity for shrubs and number of species and diversity for herb. The species composition were different in two stand i.e., Nothopegia racemosa\xe2\x80\x93Albizia amara\xe2\x80\x93Maba neilghrrensis in low disturbed stand and Albizia amara\xe2\x80\x93Pleiospermium alatum\xe2\x80\x93Bauhinia racemosa in high disturbed stand. The major disturbance factors identification using spearman rank correlation indicated that the disturbance in low disturbed habitats were mostly from past logging followed by cutting and illicit felling and grazing, while in high disturbed habitats, it was human presence, past logging and lopping and fuel wood collection.'

Abstract: 'In fast-changing tropical landscapes, effective strategies for conservation must incorporate information on ecosystems and species distribution with that on landscape change. A possible methodology for conservation prioritization is developed and illustrated using a 27.5 km2 tropical landscape in the Western Ghats hill chain of southern India. Vegetation types or ecosystems within the landscape are ranked based on the ecosystem services they might provide: number of endemic species harbored, species richness, contribution to carbon uptake, economic value of produce per ha and contribution to soil renewal. For a vegetation type, the weighted average of these ranks indicates its net conservation value. Weights thus provide a means of ascribing differential importance to an ecosystem service. Information on landscape change is also summarized by a matrix depicting the likelihood of transformations between vegetation types present in the landscape, projected 5 years into the future. For each transformation between two vegetation types, information on ecosystem service and dynamics is then integrated. Implications from the perspective of conservation are assessed as the product of transformation probability and the resultant gain/loss in conservation value. Strongly positive transformations are likely to result in positive impacts on conservation value, and occur without any additional conservation effort. Strongly negative transformations are likely to occur and have a strong negative impact on conservation value. Maximum conservation effort may be directed at halting or reversing these. This study thus describes a method for conservation prioritization, which integrates information on ecosystem function and services with ecosystem dynamics.'

Title: 'Species turnover: the case of stream amphibians of rainforests in the Western Ghats, southern India'

Abstract: "We examined species turnover in stream amphibians in rainforest in two hill ranges (Ashambu and Anamalai Hills) in the Western Ghats in south India. In each hill range, six stream segments (100\xc2\xa0m in length) belonging to three drainage or rivers were surveyed three to four times in three seasons over 1\xc2\xa0year. Species turnover (using 1-Sorenson's index) was estimated between all possible pairs of sites at three spatial scales \xe2\x80\x93 within drainage, between drainage and between hill ranges. Similar matrices were also developed for altitudinal difference and geographic distance between sites. A total of 30 species in four families were recorded from 3681 individuals. The hill ranges differed significantly in the composition of the stream community at both the species and family levels. Within the hill range, species turnover was correlated with altitudinal difference and not with geographic distance. Anamalai Hills had a greater species turnover than Ashambu Hills, both within and between drainage. There was also a high turnover between these two hill ranges, with only two shared species. This turnover explains the fact that only 30\xe2\x80\x9340 species have been reported from different hill ranges, although regional diversity is high with about 130 species. The turnover also predicts that several undetected species should occur in hill ranges and drainage that have not been surveyed. The conservation model for mammals and birds, consisting of a few large protected areas, may not adequately address the conservation requirements of amphibians. Protection of rainforest frogs may require many protected areas in different drainages."

Abstract: 'Remote sensing offers fast and reliable technique to map the variation in plant diversity and distribution at different scales. Using 891 geo-tagged ground sampled point collected for the Western Ghats, India from a national level study on biodiversity characterization. We analyzed the distribution of plant species with respect to the satellite derived vegetation indices. The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer derived vegetation products, i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), leaf area index (LAI), and surface reflectance (SR-645nm and SR-858nm) were fitted to suitable regression curves with respect to plant species richness where NDVI demonstrated the best fit (R2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.07); while fPAR showed (R2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.08) better relation with woody species richness. We observed positive but weak correlation for all the biophysiological proxies with species richness in the forests of Western Ghats. The annual pattern of correlation faired than seasonal (i.e., post-monsoon) between biophysical variables and species richness, while the woody subset of the species richness demonstrated marginally better relation at annual scale. The range of each biophysical proxy varied from medium to high, indicating higher vegetation strength. The species richness trend increased linearly for NDVI and EVI. The positive correlation showed by fPAR and LAI could be due to varied canopy architecture of the Western Ghats forests. Utility of fine resolution spatio-temporal data could render better understanding of species richness pattern using biophysical proxies, and thereby, help in long-term biodiversity monitoring.'

Abstract: 'While the conservation impacts of invasive plant species on tropical biodiversity is widely recognised, little is known of the potential for cultivated crops turning invasive in tropical forest regions. In the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, India, fragmented rainforests often adjoin coffee plantations. This study in the Anamalai hills assessed the effects of distance from edges and forest structure on the occurrence and abundance of shade-tolerant coffee (Arabica Coffea arabica and Robusta C. canephora) in four fragments (32\xe2\x80\x93200\xc2\xa0ha) using replicate line transects laid from the edges into the interiors. The coffee species cultivated in adjoining plantations was more abundant than the other coffee species inside study fragments, showing a clear decline in stem density from edge (0\xc2\xa0m) to interior (250\xc2\xa0m), suggesting the influence of propagule pressure of adjoining plantations, coupled with edge effects and seed dispersal by animals. Significant positive correlations of coffee density with canopy cover indicate the potential threat of coffee invasion even in closed canopy rainforests. Stem density of Coffea arabica (150\xe2\x80\x931,825\xc2\xa0stems/ha) was higher in more disturbed fragments, whereas Coffea canephora had spread in disturbed and undisturbed sites achieving much higher densities (6.3\xe2\x80\x9311,486\xc2\xa0stems/ha). In addition, a negative relationship between C. canephora and native shrub density indicates its potential detrimental effects on native plants.'

Abstract: 'This paper introduces a new statistical method that we recommend should become standard procedure to quantify the goodness-of-fit of calibration and validation for land-use change models. We present a multiple-resolution Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC) that measures the goodness-of-fit between a reference map, which is considered reality, and a simulated map, which is a model\xe2\x80\x99s output. This proposed ROC is based on: (1) multiple-resolutions, (2) soft classification, (3) sampling without replacement, and 4) explicit separation of factors of quantity versus location of land-use change. We illustrate the method with a case study in India\xe2\x80\x99s Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot, where we have maps of cumulative forest disturbance for 1920 and 1990. We use a predictive modeling approach similar to GEOMOD in which we calibrate the model with the map of 1920, then predict the map of 1990, at which point we subject the model to validation. We show that the fit of calibration tends to be much larger than the fit of validation. Thus if a modeler assess a model by goodness-of-fit of calibration only, then the modeler will likely be over confident in the model\xe2\x80\x99s predictive ability.'

Abstract: 'The Red Data Book of Indian Plants (RDB) is a reference manual that lists threatened angiosperms, gymnosperms and pterydophytes. Because it is widely used as an analytical tool and is a major reference for impact assessments on vegetation, it is important that the RDB be as comprehensive and up to date as possible. This study is an attempt to cross-check the listings in the RDB using vegetation inventories and another reference manual, the Atlas of Endemics of the Western Ghats, India []. Field inventories across the Western Ghats gave an estimate of the species relative abundances and the Atlas provided quantitative information on the number of records for the endemic species in herbaria, literature, and during field surveys. The results of this analysis indicate that the RDB and the Atlas agree statistically regarding the conservation status of endemic trees. However, the proportion of threatened species per Atlas record category behaves erratically, indicating that some threatened endemic trees are not listed in the RDB. Our results suggest that the status of threatened plant species should be reexamined on a priority basis using quantitative methodology. An updating of the RDB is urgently needed, particularly for the endemic plants of the Western Ghats. We provide a list of species that are likely to be threatened, yet are not listed.'

Title: 'Abundance and diversity of soil invertebrates in annual crops, agroforestry and forest ecosystems in the Nilgiri biosphere reserve of Western Ghats, India'

Abstract: 'Biologically mediated soil processes rely on soil biota to provide vital ecosystem services in natural and managed ecosystems. However, land use changes continue to impact on assemblages of soil biota and the ecosystem services they provide. The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of land use intensification on the distribution and abundance of soil invertebrate communities in the Nilgiri, a human-dominated biosphere reserve of international importance. Soil invertebrates were sampled in 15 land use practices ranging from simple and intensively managed annual crop fields and monoculture tree plantations through less intensively managed agroforestry and pristine forest ecosystems. The lowest taxonomic richness was found in annual crops and coconut monoculture plantations, while the highest was in moist-deciduous and semi-evergreen forests. With 21 ant species, agroforestry systems had the highest diversity of ants followed by forest ecosystems (12 species). Earthworms and millipedes were significantly more abundant in agroforestry systems, plantations and forest ecosystems than in annual crop fields. Ants, termites, beetles, centipedes, crickets and spiders were more abundant in forest ecosystems than in other ecosystems. It is concluded that annual cropping systems have lower diversity and abundance of soil invertebrates than agroforestry and natural forest ecosystems. These results and the literature from other regions highlight the potential role that agroforestry practices can play in biodiversity conservation in an era of ever-increasing land use intensification and habitat loss.'

Abstract: 'The purpose of this study was to quantify the changes in tree diversity and above-ground biomass associated with six land-use types in Kodagu district of India\xe2\x80\x99s Western Ghats. We collected data on species richness, composition and above-ground biomass (AGB) of trees, shrubs and herbs from 96 sample plots of 0.1\xc2\xa0ha. Totals of 83 species from 26 families were recorded across the land-uses. Tree species richness, diversity and composition were significantly higher in evergreen forest (EGF) than in other land-uses. Similarly, stem density and basal area were greater in EGF compared to other land-uses. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) yielded three distinct groups along the land-use intensities and rainfall gradient on the first and second axes, respectively. The first DCA axis accounted for 45% and second axis for 35% of the total variation in species composition. Together the first two axes accounted for over 2/3 of the variation in species composition across land-use types. Across the land-uses, AGB ranged from 58.6\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in rubber plantation to 327.3\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in evergreen forest. Our results showed that species diversity and AGB were negatively impacted by the land-use changes. We found that coffee agroforests resembled natural forest and mixed species plantation in terms of tree diversity and biomass production, suggesting that traditional coffee farms can help to protect tree species, sustain smallholder production and offer opportunities for conservation of biodiversity and climate change mitigation.'

Abstract: 'Understanding how different audience groups perceive wildlife is crucial for the promotion of biodiversity conservation, especially given the key role of flagship species in conservation campaigns. Although the heterogeneity in preferences reinforces the need for campaigns tailored to specific target audiences, many conservation education and awareness campaigns still claim to target the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral public\xe2\x80\x9d. Audiences can be segmented according to social, economic, and cultural criteria across which species perceptions are known to vary. Different studies have investigated the preferences of different groups towards certain wildlife species, but these are largely confined to a single conservation stakeholder group, such as tourists, local communities, or potential donors in western countries. In this study, we seek to determine from a multi-stakeholder perspective, audience characteristics that influence perceptions towards wildlife at Valparai, a fragmented plateau in the Western Ghats region of the Western Ghats-Sri Lanka Hotspot. We found that stakeholder group membership was the most important characteristic followed by gender. While some characteristics had a wide-scale effect others were restricted to a few species. Our results emphasize the need to design conservation campaigns with specific audiences in mind, instead of the very often referred to \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral public\xe2\x80\x9d.'

Abstract: 'Hill forts of Northern Western Ghats offer an interesting mix of man-made and natural habitats and as a result shelter a great diversity of endemic and threatened plants. Strict protection of certain areas and selective interference for strategic reasons on hill forts are responsible for maintenance of large protected populations of local endemic species. This has also created special patterns of plant distribution. In recent years, many novelties have been described from forts. Though hill forts have gained importance from the historical and archeological point of view, they are seldom considered as biodiversity conservatories. We suggest here that while prioritizing conservation areas in Northern Western Ghats, hill forts should be given a status of local biodiversity hotspots and conservation should be provided to all microhabitats that are natural as well as man-made. This will assure protection of endemic and threatened species of Western Ghats as well as local endemics of Northern Western Ghats.'

Abstract: 'Species diversity of earthworms in tropics is less studied compared to those of the temperate regions. Despite the fact that there have been numerous studies on earthworm diversity in the Western Ghats of India, there still exists scope for more earthworm species which are yet to be described. The present work involves a survey of earthworms in the Nilgiri biosphere reserve (NBR)\xe2\x80\x94a part of a biodiversity hot spot of Western Ghats. Despite being a part of the biodiversity hot spot, studies on earthworm diversity at NBR are very limited. Unless an authentic record of earthworm species is made available, the consequence of human interference, habitat alteration or climate change on the species diversity cannot be assessed. An attempt has been made in this study to conduct a survey of earthworm species available in the selected forest ecosystems of the NBR. The findings of this study have shown that 84.67\xc2\xa0% of the earthworm species identified is native, while the rest are exotic. On the basis of total number of earthworms collected, exotics accounted for 1.55\xc2\xa0%, indicating the predominance of native species in the study area and indicating that this habitat is less disturbed. Among the species identified from Mukurthi, Priodochaeta pellucida is listed as vulnerable and has never been encountered since its discovery about 100\xc2\xa0years ago. Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Weiner indices showed that evergreen forests of Silent Valley have a high species diversity as do shola/grasslands of Mukurthi and moist deciduous forests of Muthanga.'

Abstract: 'The center of diversity of Piper nigrum L. (Black Pepper), one of the highly valued spice crops is reported to be from India. Black pepper is naturally distributed in India in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot and is the only known existing source of its wild germplasm in the world. We used ecological niche models to predict the potential distribution of wild P. nigrum in the present and two future climate change scenarios viz (A1B) and (A2A) for the year 2080. Three topographic and nine uncorrelated bioclim variables were used to develop the niche models. The environmental variables influencing the distribution of wild P. nigrum across different climate change scenarios were identified. We also assessed the direction and magnitude of the niche centroid shift and the change in niche breadth to estimate the impact of projected climate change on the distribution of P. nigrum. The study shows a niche centroid shift in the future climate scenarios. Both the projected future climate scenarios predicted a reduction in the habitat of P. nigrum in Southern Western Ghats, which harbors many wild accessions of P. nigrum. Our results highlight the impact of future climate change on P. nigrum and provide useful information for designing sound germplasm conservation strategies for P. nigrum.'

Abstract: 'We assessed soil fungal diversity in the dry deciduous forest of a Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary of the Western Ghats (210.31 m a.s.l.; N 13\xc2\xb044\xe2\x80\xb2 and E75\xc2\xb037\xe2\x80\xb2). Soil samples were collected by random mixed sampling during winter (November, 2008), summer (March, 2009) and monsoon (August, 2009) seasons, and physico-chemical parameters were recorded. During winter, summer, and monsoon seasons, 49, 45 and 49 of fungal species belongs to 20, 18 and 19 of genera were isolated, respectively. Isolated soil fungi were mainly of the Mitosporic fungi, followed by Zygomycotina, Ascomycotina, Oomycotina and Coelomycetes. Indices of diversity, dominance and fisher alpha during winter, summer and monsoon seasons were 3.756, 3.638 and 3.738 (H\xe2\x80\xb2), 0.9737, 0.9694 and 0.9726 (1-D) and 18.84, 29.83 and 19.46 (\xce\xb1), respectively. Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s (r) correlation coefficient of fungal population with physico-chemical parameters of soils showed significantly positive and negative correlations (p<0.01) during winter, summer and monsoon seasons. Physico-chemical soil parameters played an important role in the occurrence, diversity, distribution, and relative abundance of fungal species in the tropical dry deciduous forest soil.'

I Western Ghats n. sp., a distome, apharyngeate, non-ocellate and spinose cercaria having three pairs of penetration glands, kidney- shaped small caeca and 20 pairs of flame cells including a pair in the furcae was recovered from I. exustus and Cercaria sp. II Western Ghats n. sp., a non-ocellate, pharyngeate, longifurcate furcocercous cercaria with two pairs of irregularly bordered penetration glands, septate caeca and 21 pairs of flame cells including three pairs in the furcae, from T. tuberculata. Sporocysts of Cercaria sp. I Western Ghats n. sp. were sausage-shaped while that of Cercaria sp. II Western Ghats n. sp. were thread-like and both of them developed in the hepatopancreas of their hosts. This paper describes the two new cercariae with their intramolluscan stages and compares them with related species to establish their systematic positions.'

Abstract: 'The effect of fragmentation on different life forms within tropical forest plant communities is poorly understood. We studied the effect of degree of fragmentation and surrounding matrix on trees, lianas, shrubs and epiphytes in tropical forest fragments of Kodagu, Western Ghats, India. These fragments exist as sacred groves amidst a highly modified agricultural landscape, and have been preserved by the religious sentiments of local communities. Plants were sampled at two sites in continuous forests and 11 forest fragments. A total of 122 species of trees, 29 species of lianas, 60 species of shrubs and 66 species of epiphytes were recorded. Trees exhibited a significant species\xe2\x80\x93area relationship (R 2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.74). Richness estimates after controlling for stem density (rarefaction) revealed that observed species\xe2\x80\x93area relationship was not an artefact of passive sampling. Variation in species richness of the other three groups was explained by stem density and structural diversity. Linear distance from the reserve forest did not explain any variation in species richness. All life forms exhibited significant nested pattern. Trees were nested along the area gradient while nestedness in the other three groups showed evidence in support of habitat nestedness. The four life forms thus responded variably to degree of fragmentation. Our study revealed that 74% of the regional diversity for trees was contributed by diversity among plots, highlighting the importance of inter-patch habitat diversity in maintaining the total regional species pool. We conclude that trees alone cannot serve as good indicator for taking appropriate conservation measures to mitigate species loss resulting from habitat fragmentation.'

Abstract: 'The Western Ghats forms an important watershed for the entire peninsular India, being the source of 37 west flowing rivers and three major east flowing rivers and their numerous tributaries. However, deforestation due to large scale land cover changes has affected the water sustenance in the region evident from the quantity and duration of water availability during post monsoon period. Land use Land cover changes accelerated by unplanned anthropogenic activities have been the prime mover of global warming and consequent changes in the climate. This necessitates appropriate resource management with an understanding of drivers. Geo-visualization of landscape transitions considering the influential agents will aid in formulating strategies to mitigate global warming. Uttara Kannada district in the Central Western Ghats has the distinction of having highest forest cover in the country and this region is now experiencing rapid forest cover changes. Factors inducing changes in the land cover are normalized through fuzzyfication, considered for Multi criteria Evaluation using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) under high protection and low protection scenarios. Likely land use transitions by 2022 across zones based on transitions during 2004\xe2\x80\x932007, 2007\xe2\x80\x932010, 2010\xe2\x80\x932013 was done through cellular automata and Markov chain process (MC). The analyses highlight the loss of forest cover by 66.55\xe2\x80\x9356.76% by 2022 in the coastal zone with escalating population density. Similar situation of 65.98\xe2\x80\x9355.62% decline in Sahyadri region is noticed with execution of dams, hydroelectric projects and monoculture plantations. Lower transitions as compared with the second scenario highlights regulatory framework\xe2\x80\x99s role in protection. However, forests in plain region show loss of 27.38\xe2\x80\x9311.09% in both scenarios due to population pressure and market induced land cover changes. This necessitates policy interventions by the federal government to mitigate forest loss towards sustainable development.'

Abstract: 'Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae, Caesalpinioideae) is a dominant self-incompatible ant-plant or myrmecophyte, growing as an understorey tree in high-density patches. It is endemic to the biodiversity hotspot of the southern Western Ghats of India and, besides ants, harbours many endemic invertebrate taxa, such as bees that pollinate it as well as arboreal earthworms, within swollen hollow stem internodes called domatia. Using inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers, three geographically separated populations were found to be multiclonal, characterized by high levels of clonal diversity. Values for the Simpson diversity index ranged between 0.764 and 0.964, and for Fager\xe2\x80\x99s evenness index between 0.00 and 0.036 for neighbourhoods within populations. This myrmecophyte was found to combine sexual recruitment (66.7%) and clonal production (33.3%) as methods of reproduction. Moderate amounts of genetic diversity at the species level were observed, with 52.63% polymorphism, and moderate values of Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s diversity index (0.1895) as well as of Nei\xe2\x80\x99s gene diversity (0.1186). In each population, observed genotypic diversity was significantly lower than expected, indicating significant genetic structure. Neighbour-joining trees demonstrated that Agumbe, which is the most northern population examined and geographically twice as far away from the other two populations, grouped separately and with larger bootstrap support from a larger cluster consisting of the Sampaji and Solaikolli populations, which are closer to each other geographically. Some neighbourhoods within each population showed spatial genetic structure even at small spatial scales of <5 m. A combination of clonality and short-distance pollen movement by small pollinating bees (Braunsapis puangensis) coupled with primary ballistic seed dispersal, and possible secondary seed dispersal by rodents, may contribute to spatial genetic structure at such small scales. The clonality of H. brunonis may be a factor that contributes to its dominance in Western Ghat forests where it supports a rich diversity of invertebrate fauna.'

Abstract: 'Herbaceous vascular epiphytes were screened in a total sample of 13 445 trees (in 153 species) and 348 lianas (in 30 species) \xe2\x89\xa530 cm girth at breast height in a 30 ha plot of tropical evergreen forest at Varagalaiar, Indian Western Ghats. Of these, 4.3% of trees and 3.7% of lianas were infested with epiphytes. Epiphyte diversity totaled 26 species in 19 genera and 10 families. Sixteen species were angiosperms in three families (Orchidaceae 54%; Piperaceae and Araceae 8%) and 10 species (38%) were pteridophytes in seven families. The orchid, Pholidota pallida was most abundant and occurred on 178 (29.6%) stems. Asplenium nidus occurred on the maximum of 62 host species. The species richness estimators employed for species accumulation curves after 100 times randomization of sample order have stabilized the curve at 18th and 19th hectares respectively for Incidence-based Coverage Estimator and Chao2. A total of 588 trees and 13 liana stems lodged epiphytes, 74% of which were evergreen species and 26% deciduous. Epiphyte density was greater (56%) in deciduous species (Bischofia javanica 30% and Vitex altissima 8%). A significant positive relationship was found between trunk size and epiphyte association. Larger epiphyte species occurred mostly on middle and larger stems and smaller epiphyte species occurred on smaller stems. The majority of epiphytes (92%) were of autochorous dispersal type, bearing capsule or dust diaspores, while the remaining species with berries and nutlets are dispersed by small vertebrates.'

Abstract: 'We have used data generated using remote sensing and geographical information systems to categorize habitats, and then determined the relationship between the habitat categorizations and species-distribution patterns. A biologically rich hotspot\xe2\x80\x94Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, located at Southern Western Ghats, India, was chosen for this study. In order to spatially delineate areas of high species richness/diversity and endemic habitat zones, we have identified evergreen habitats in conjunction with landscape metrics, species assemblage, micro-habitats like slope, topography, species endemism, and proportion of core and edge species. A total of 236 species and 2,920 individuals were recorded using systematic stratified plots of 0.1\xc2\xa0ha covering 47 plots. Hierarchical cluster analysis was done using Ward\xe2\x80\x99s method. Plot information was used to identify clusters based on species density. The analysis showed five species assemblages that are quite distinct from each other in terms of dominant species. The distribution of endemic and edge species, land cover heterogeneity, and continuity of patches in these clusters were evaluated to understand the degree of disturbance and intactness at landscape scale. Integration of species assemblages and topography brought out four major elevation-slope complexes. Information on species composition (robust field survey) with spectral (hybrid classification) properties has shown 72% overall accuracy and distinguished four evergreen sub-groups and other land cover classes. The developed approach assumes great importance in the assessment of biodiversity and prioritizing the areas of conservation.'

Title: 'Fine- and local- scale genetic structure of Dysoxylum malabaricum, a late-successional canopy tree species in disturbed forest patches in the Western Ghats, India'

Abstract: ' Dysoxylum malabaricum (white cedar) is an economically important tree species, endemic to the Western Ghats, India, which is the world\xe2\x80\x99s most densely populated biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we used variation at ten nuclear simple sequence repeat loci to investigate genetic diversity and fine scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) in seedlings and adults of D. malabaricum from four forest patches in the northern part of the Western Ghats. When genetic variation was compared between seedlings and adults across locations, significant differences were detected in allelic richness, observed heterozygosity, fixation index (F IS), and relatedness (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). Reduced genetic diversity and increased relatedness at the seedling stage might be due to fragmentation and disturbance. There was no FSGS at the adult stage and FSGS was limited to shorter distance classes at the seedling stage. However, there was clear spatial genetic structure at the landscape level (<50\xc2\xa0km), regardless of age class, due to limited gene flow between forest patches. A comparison of the distributions of size classes in the four locations with published data from a more southern area, showed that large trees (diameter at breast height, DBH, >130\xc2\xa0cm) are present in the southern sacred forests but not in the northern forest reserves. This pattern is likely due to stronger harvesting pressure in the north compared to the south, because in the north there are no cultural taboos regulating the extraction of natural resources. The implications for forest conservation in this biodiversity hotspot are discussed.'

Abstract: 'Tree diversity (\xe2\x89\xa530 cm gbh) in undisturbed and human-impacted tropical evergreen forest sites was investigated in the Kolli hills, Eastern Ghats, India. Four 2-ha contiguous permanent plots were erected, one each in Perumakkai shola (site PS), Vengodai shola (VS), Kuzhivalavu shola (KS) and Mottukkadu shola (MS) at 1000, 1050, 1200 and 1250 m elevation, with increasing human disturbance, to evaluate the difference in tree species composition, stand structure and dynamics. This paper discusses the results of the first survey. A total of 3825 individuals and 78 species from 61 genera and 36 families were enumerated in the 8 ha area. Among the four 2-ha sites, species richness was greatest (58) in the undisturbed site PS and lowest (39) in the highly disturbed site MS. Shannon, Simpson, Hill diversity and evenness indexes revealed a progressive reduction in diversity with increasing disturbance. The asymptote species-area curves imply adequate site sampling. Tree density (1151 to 651 trees ha\xe2\x88\x922) and basal area (106 to 46.6 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x922) decreased from undisturbed to disturbed site, due to selective felling. Single species, Memecylon umbellatum dominated sites MS (39%) and VS (26%), while Nothopegia heyneana, Memecylon umbellatum and Diospyros ovalifolia were dominant in PS, and Meliosma simplicifolia, Myristica dactyloides and Phoebe wightii in KS. Based on species abundance, we classify the study area as Memecylon\xe2\x80\x93Phoebe\xe2\x80\x93Beilschmiedia association with Neolitsea and Myristica as codominants. Tree population structure revealed a step-wise decline in girth frequencies with increasing size class in undisturbed site PS, whereas tree density fell sharp (>50%) in medium girth class in the disturbed site MS. Population of the dominant species varied widely. The diversity values of this inventory are compared with similar studies in India and other tropical forests. Evidently, the reduction in species richness (by 52%), basal area (56%) and tree density (58%) in disturbed sites, with 57.6% of species rarity of this tropical evergreen forest, in secluded patches (\xe2\x80\x98sholas\xe2\x80\x99) of Kolli hills, underlines conservation need to prevent species loss.'

Abstract: 'Freshwater fish comprise one of the most threatened vertebrate groups with close to one-third of the species in danger of extinction (Dudgeon 2012) and several species already extinct (Baillie and Butcher 2012). This vulnerability has been largely attributed among others, to the poor state of knowledge (Dudgeon 2003, 2012; Cooke et al. 2012), and the uneven distribution of conservation attention and investment (Darwall et al. 2011a) on freshwater ecosystems and their resources.'

Abstract: 'There are thousands of protected forest areas existing on earth, yet the deforestation rate continues unabated both inside and outside the protected areas especially in the tropical forests. It identifies the less effectiveness of the current conservation strategies, which is normally oriented around the forest area cover rather than the quality of the protected areas. This calls for realistic and effective management strategies for forests. Based on the drawbacks the present study aims at identifying conservation priority sites within the protected areas (Reserved Forests) of Shervarayan hills, Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India. The remnant forest patches having less effective management/protection is identified and analysed for its qualitative contribution to the ecosystem. Quadrats of 20\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97 20\xc2\xa0m were laid in different vegetation based on the percentage of forest cover and assess the species diversity pertaining the richness, Endemism and Red list categories. Thematic layers (maps) such as vegetation type, floristic species richness, floristic endemism, and red list flora are created and categorized according to their weightage classes and overlaid in GIS domain to demarcate the Conservation Priority Zones (CPZ). The CPZ are classified according to the priority status i.e., high, moderate and low based on the contributing species richness, levels of endemism and concentration of Red listed plants.'

Abstract: 'Endophytic fungi are major contributors to fungal diversity and an important component of plant microbiota. Plants growing in biodiversity hotspots and having ethnobotanical utility are often explored for the presence of endophytic fungi with bioactive potential. Western Ghat mountains of India are one of the ten famous biodiversity hotspots in the world. Hence, in the present study, we investigated the diversity of endophytic fungi associated with tissues of Nothapodytes foetida (a tree), Hypericum mysorense (a shrub) and Hypericum japonicum (a herb) collected from forests of Western Ghats with emphasis on diversity of endophytic fungi harbored in different tissues of three plants and their antimicrobial and free radical scavenging activities. A total of 298 isolates belonging to 31 genera were isolated along with dark septate and sterile fungi. All isolates belonged to Dothidiomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes of the phylum Ascomycota. Most frequent colonizers were Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Gliocladium, Cladosporium, Trichoderma, Colletotrichum, and Pestalotiopsis. Endophytes showed neither any host preference nor any dominance of a single species. Ethyl acetate extracts of 39 endophytic fungi exhibited antimicrobial activity against one or more pathogens, of which the activity of Bionectria ochroleuca NOTL33, Chaetomium globosum HYML55, Alternaria brassicae HYMS01, Aspergillus sp. HYML56 was prominent against most of the pathogens tested. 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2\xe2\x80\xb2-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) free radicals were effectively quenched by the ethyl acetate extracts of 28 isolates and 34 isolates, respectively. This study is the first of its kind in H. mysorense and H. japonicum, and not only describes the endophytic diversity of these plants but also emphasizes the bioactive potential of endophytic isolates for future use in agricultural, pharmaceutical and industrial applications.'

Abstract: 'Tropical dry forests and savannas constitute more than half of all tropical forests and grasslands, but little is known about forest fire regimes within these two extensive types of ecosystems. Forest fire regimes in a predominantly dry forest in India, the Nilgiri landscape, and a predominantly savanna ecosystem in the Sathyamangalam landscape, were examined. Remote sensing data were applied to delineate burned areas, determine fire size characteristics, and to estimate fire-rotation intervals. Belt transects (0.5 ha) were used to estimate forest structure, diversity, and fuel loads. Mean area burned, mean number of fires, and mean fire size per year were substantially higher in the Nilgiri landscape compared to the Sathyamangalam landscape. Mean fire-rotational interval was 7.1 yr in the Nilgiri landscape and 44.1 yr in the Sathyamangalam landscape. Tree (\xe2\x89\xa510 cm diameter at breast height) species diversity, tree density, and basal area were significantly higher in the Nilgiri landscape compared to the Sathyamangalam landscape. Total fuel loads were significantly higher in tropical dry and moist deciduous forests in the Nilgiri landscape, but total fuel loads were higher in the tropical dry thorn forests of the Sathyamangalam landscape. Thus, the two landscapes revealed contrasting fire regimes and forest characteristics, with more and four-fold larger fires in the Nilgiri landscape. The dry forests and savannas could be maintained by a combination of factors, such as fire, grazing pressures, and herbivore populations. Understanding the factors maintaining these two ecosystems will be critical for their conservation.'

Abstract: 'Sacred areas are the oldest form of habitat protection, and many of these areas contribute to biodiversity conservation. While sacred groves have received considerable scholarly attention, little is known about fresh water swamps in the Western Ghats, India and sacred swamps have largely been ignored. This paper provides a first overview testing the conjecture that sacred swamps have physical features that distinguish them from non-sacred swamps. We assessed 110 fresh water swamps in the district of Uttara Kannada, Central Western Ghats, India, through extensive field surveys. Out of them 11 swamps are \xe2\x80\x98sacred\xe2\x80\x99 according to local testimony. Swamps are found in wet evergreen and evergreen forest types, but sacred swamps occur only in the wet evergreen forests. Sacred swamps differ significantly from non-sacred swamps with respect to size and shape, distance to the nearest road, human settlement, and commercial orchard, and population density within a radius of 500\xc2\xa0m. This shows that preferentially swamps close to settlements, orchards and roads have been declared as sacred, probably to regulate the continuing provision of relevant ecosystem services. While we find a variety of deities associated with these sacred swamps, the practices associated with sacred swamp status and management are essentially the same across belief groups. However, the conservation practice is at risk due to migration dynamics.'

Abstract: 'Caecilians are legless amphibians quite characteristic of the Western Ghats. Fourteen out of 16 Indian species occur in the Western Ghats and all are endemic. The present paper deals with the biology of caecilians with reference to external morphology and general breeding behaviour. It consolidates information on 26 morphological parameters which are used in caecilian identification. Metric multidimensional scaling of 16 species of caecilians using pair-wise euclidian distances calculated on the basis of 11 important morphometric parameters clearly depicts morphological distances between different species and more so the genera, thereby validating the classification. A field guide has been developed for the identification of caecilians based on a survey made all over the Western Ghats, observation of holotypes at the Natural History Museum, London and review of the literature. The study also reveals the microhabitat requirements of the caecilians. Further, the localities of caecilian distribution in the Western Ghats are mapped. The taxonomy of Indian caecilians is discussed.'

Abstract: 'Spatially explicit approach is essential to prioritise the ecosystems for biodiversity conservation. In the present study, the conservation status of 20 protected areas of the Western Ghats of Kerala, India, was analysed based on long-term changes in forests (1975\xe2\x80\x931985\xe2\x80\x931995\xe2\x80\x932005\xe2\x80\x932013), landscape level changes in fragmentation and forest fires (2005\xe2\x80\x932015). This study has shown that a significant forest loss occurred in protected areas before declaration. Idukki is one of the major protected areas which showed a drastic reduction (18.83%) in its forest cover. During 1985\xe2\x80\x931995, Periyar tiger reserve had lost 24.19\xc2\xa0km2 core 3 forest area followed by Peppara (18.54\xc2\xa0km2), Parambikulam (17.93\xc2\xa0km2), Chimmony (17.71\xc2\xa0km2), Peechi-Vazhani (12.31\xc2\xa0km2) and Neyyar (11.67\xc2\xa0km2). An area of 71.33\xc2\xa0km2 of the protected area was affected by fires in 2014. Overall protected area-wise decadal analysis indicates Periyar has the highest number of fire incidences followed by Wayanad, Kurinjimala, Silent Valley and Eravikulam. Disturbances in the form of fires and fragmentation still exist and may have significant conservation threat to flora and fauna. Among protected areas, many are having a probability to go under threat or dynamic stage. Chinnar, Thattekkad and Kurinjimala sanctuaries are representing high levels of vulnerability, or they are near to decline stage. Habitat level monitoring of the anthropogenic disturbances can be efficiently useful for the strategic conservation planning. The present study has provided geospatial database on spatial patterns of deforestation, fragmentation and forest fires in protected areas of Kerala. Conservation prioritization approach based on these parameters will be useful for the strategic planning in the state of Kerala.'

Abstract: 'Plants diversity and phenological pattern of the trees were monitored in a montane wet temperate forest (shola) in the Kukkal Forest, Palni hills of the southern Western Ghats, India. Twelve random plots were selected for sampling the vegetation. For phenological studies, twenty-three fleshy fruit trees were identified in the study area and 10 individuals of each species were selected to record the phenological events fortnightly between April 2002 and April 2004. The phenological events were divided into vegetative and reproductive phases. A total of 2279 individuals were inventoried which belong to 83 species, 68 genera and 40 families. About 30% of the species were endemic to the Western Ghats. The most dominant species (\xe2\x89\xa5 1 cm dbh) was Psychotria nilgiriensis var. astephana (Rubiaceae), which accounted for 12% of the total sampled individuals. Lauraceae was the dominant family accounting for 20% of the individuals. Fruiting peak occurred in July 2003 and least in June 2002. During the peak period, fruits of 85 individuals of six species were observed. Syzygium tamilnadensis, Ilex wightiana and Beilschmiedia wightii fruited only once during the two years of study. The number of fruiting species showed no correlation with rainfall (r = 0.26, p = 0.2), while a correlation was found with fruit abundance (r = 0.40, p < 0.05). The results indicate that the montane wet temperate forest is unique in their diversity and a conspicuous display in phenology.'

Abstract: 'Thirty-six medicinal plant species belonging to 25 families were surveyed to study Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal diversity from different localities of North and South Goa of Western Ghats, Goa region, India. A total of 30 medicinal plant species were found to be mycorrhizal and six plant species showed absence of AM fungal colonization. Forty two AM fungal species belonging to five genera viz., Glomus, Acaulospora, Scutellospora, Gigaspora and Ambispora were recovered from the rhizosphere soil. Glomus was found to be the most dominant genera in the study sites, and Glomus fasciculatum the most dominant AM fungal species. Negative significant correlation was observed between percent colonization and spore density. Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s and Shannon Weiner diversity index studies carried out in North and South Goa exhibited less variation in both the sites, indicating a stable and a diverse plant community.'

Abstract: 'This study documents the distribution patterns, endemism and uniqueness (species richness) of fishes in the Tunga and Bhadra rivers of Western Ghats, India. We recorded 77 species represented by 7 orders, 16 families and 44 genera, of which 36 species are endemic to Western Ghats, 12 species endemic to India and 26 species endemic to the Indian Subcontinent. Based on our analysis on the distribution patterns, the Tunga River is richer in diversity and higher in endemism than the Bhadra. We calculated the similarity of the species composition among sites within these two rivers using the Jacquard index. The similarity index between the sampling sites of these rivers revealed that the similarity decreases with increasing distance between the sampling sites. Of the 77 fish species we collected, 8 species (11.1%) are in the Critical category, 10 species (13.8%) are in the High Risk category, 36 species (50%) are in the Moderate category and the remaining 18 species (25%) are at lower risk. The threat status of fishes found in the Tunga and Bhadra rivers strongly suggests the need for effective conservation measures to conserve the fish species richness of these rivers.'

Abstract: 'Given the increasing anthropogenic pressures on forests, the various protected areas\xe2\x80\x94national parks, sanctuaries, and biosphere reserves\xe2\x80\x94serve as the last footholds for conserving biological diversity. However, because protected areas are often targeted for the conservation of selected species, particularly charismatic animals, concerns have been raised about their effectiveness in conserving nontarget taxa and their genetic resources. In this paper, we evaluate whether protected areas can serve as refugia for genetic resources of economically important plants that are threatened due to extraction pressures. We examine the population structure and genetic diversity of an economically important rattan, Calamus thwaitesii, in the core, buffer and peripheral regions of three protected areas in the central Western Ghats, southern India. Our results indicate that in all the three protected areas, the core and buffer regions maintain a better population structure, as well as higher genetic diversity, than the peripheral regions of the protected area. Thus, despite the escalating pressures of extraction, the protected areas are effective in conserving the genetic resources of rattan. These results underscore the importance of protected areas in conservation of nontarget species and emphasize the need to further strengthen the protected-area network to offer refugia for economically important plant species.'

Abstract: 'We have checked the utility of DNA barcoding for species identification of nymphalid butterflies from Western Ghats of India by using 650\xc2\xa0bp sequence of mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I. Distinct DNA barcoding gap (i.e. difference between intraspecies and interspecies nucleotide divergence), exists between species studied here. When our sequences were compared with the sequences of the conspecifics submitted from different geographic regions, nine cases of deep intraspecies nucleotide divergences were observed. In spite of this, NJ (Neighbour Joining) clustering analysis successfully discriminated all species. Observed cases of deep intraspecies nucleotide divergences certainly warrant further study.'

Abstract: 'Habitat fragmentation is postulated to be a major factor influencing infectious disease dynamics in wildlife populations and may also be responsible, at least in part, for the recent spurt in the emergence, or re-emergence, of infectious diseases in humans. The mechanism behind these relationships are poorly understood due to the lack of insights into the interacting local factors and insufficient baseline data in ecological parasitology of wildlife. Here, we studied the gastrointestinal parasites of nonhuman mammalian hosts living in 10 rainforest patches of the Anamalai Tiger Reserve, India. We examined 349 faecal samples of 17 mammalian species and successfully identified 24 gastrointestinal parasite taxa including 1 protozoan, 2 trematode, 3 cestode and 18 nematode taxa. Twenty of these parasites are known parasites of humans. We also found that as much as 73% of all infected samples were infected by multiple parasites. In addition, the smallest and most fragmented forest patches recorded the highest parasite richness; the pattern across fragments, however, seemed to be less straightforward, suggesting potential interplay of local factors.'

Abstract: "This study focuses on the mother-child nexus (or process of enculturation) with respect to knowledge and valuation of wild food plants in a context where accelerated processes of modernization and acculturation are leading to the erosion of knowledge and cultural values associated with wild food plant use, in Wayanad, Western Ghats, India. Wild food plants in this biodiversity hotspot form an important part of local diets and are used as famine foods and medicines. In general, the collection and consumption of these foods are increasingly stigmatized as symbols of poverty and 'tribalness' (equivalent to 'backwardness'). The study, which falls within the discipline of ethnobotany, involves three socio-cultural groups \xe2\x80\x93 the Paniya and Kuruma tribes and non-tribals. Further, it examines the impact in the enculturation process of an unusual educational programme sponsored by the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation that is oriented towards creating awareness among children of cultural identity and local biological resources \xe2\x80\x93 the study compares children having participated in the programme with those who have not, with their mothers. The process of enculturation is assessed by comparing wild food plant knowledge and values between mothers and their children, and by examining events where knowledge transmission occurs, including collection and consumption. For that, quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis tools were used, and methods included semi-structured interviews, photo identification and informal interviews of key informants."

Abstract: 'The community ecology of freshwater fishes in four river systems (Sharavati, Aghanashini, Bedti and Kali) of the central Western Ghats (India) has been studied for the first time. Patterns of fish species distributions were analysed and important stream and environmental parameters determining the species richness and composition of this region were identified. Upstream--downstream trends in species richness and diversity as well as changes in stream characteristics were studied using univariate correlation analyses. Preliminary analyses on changes in species composition and feeding guilds showed the presence of a gradual species turnover along the stream gradient. There were associated changes in the major feeding guild compositions, with a higher proportion of insectivore and algivore/herbivore composition in the upper reaches shifting to a predominance of omnivores and carnivores downstream. Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s product--moment correlation analyses along with stepwise multiple regression analyses identified stream depth and altitude as the important parameters determining species richness. Canonical correspondence analysis was performed to study species associations with environmental parameters. The analysis showed a strong species environmental correlation to the CCA axes, a high significance for the CCA axis 1 as well as for the overall test. The plots of the species and site scores on the CCA axes showed a clear segregation of species based on their relations with environmental and stream properties. This study is an important step in our understanding of the community structure of fish species of these rivers and would be helpful in future efforts on the conservation of aquatic communities and their habitats.'

Title: 'Global Warming Mitigation Through Carbon Sequestrations in the Central Western Ghats'

Abstract: 'Global warming with the escalation in greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint (400\xc2\xa0ppm from 280\xc2\xa0ppm CO2 emissions of the pre-industrial era) and consequent changes in the climate have been affecting the livelihood of people with the erosion of ecosystem productivity. The anthropogenic activities such as power generation (burning of fossil fuels), agriculture (livestock, farming, rice cultivation and burning of crop residues), polluting water bodies, and industry and urban activities (transport, mismanagement of solid, liquid waste, etc.) have risen substantially CO2 concentrations to 72% among GHGs. Emissions and sequestration of carbon need to be in balance to sustain ecosystem functions and maintain the environmental conditions. Forests are the major carbon sinks to mitigate global warming. The current research focusses on the carbon budgeting through quantification of emissions and sinks in the Uttara Kannada district, central Western Ghats, Karnataka. This would help in evolving appropriate mitigation strategies towards sustainable management of forests. The study reveals that total carbon stored in vegetation and soils are 56,911.79\xc2\xa0Gg and 59,693.44\xc2\xa0Gg, respectively. The annual carbon increment in forests is about 975.81\xc2\xa0Gg. Carbon uptake by the natural forest is about 2416.69\xc2\xa0Gg/year and by the forest plantations is 963.28\xc2\xa0Gg/year amounting to the total of 3379.97\xc2\xa0Gg/year. Sector-wise carbon emissions are 87.70\xc2\xa0Gg/year (livestock), 101.57\xc2\xa0Gg/year (paddy cultivation), 77.20\xc2\xa0Gg/year (fuel wood consumption), and 437.87\xc2\xa0Gg/year (vehicular transport), respectively. The analysis highlights that forest ecosystems in Uttara Kannada are playing a significant role in the mitigation of regional as well as global carbon emissions. Hence, the premium should be on conservation of the remaining native forests, which are vital for the water security (perennial streams) and food security (sustenance of biodiversity) and mitigation of global warming through carbon sequestration. Sustainable management ecosystem practices involving local stakeholders will further enhance the ability of forests to sequester atmospheric carbon apart from other ecosystem services, such as hydrological services and improvements in soil and water quality.'

Abstract: 'Even since Linnaeus, naturalists and taxonomists have been systematically describing species new to science. Besides indicating gaps in taxonomic effort, understanding the temporal patterns of species discovery could help in identifying drivers that determine discovery. In this study we report the patterns of discovery of eight taxa \xe2\x80\x94 birds, butterflies, frogs, tiger beetles, grasses, asters, ferns and orchids \xe2\x80\x94 in the Western Ghats, a megadiversity centre in India. Our results indicate that the discovery curves for birds and butterflies have been saturated while those for frogs and grasses continue to increase. Within each taxon, the major drivers of discovery were commonness of the species and their size. The average years taken for discovery across taxa were directly related to the per cent endemicity and species richness of the taxa. We discuss the trajectories of discovery with respect to rarity or endemicity of the species and life history features, and the implications these might have for strategizing the discovery process in India.'

Abstract: ' Decalepis arayalpathra, an endangered, endemic ethnomedicinal plant from southern Western Ghats, India, is targeted for its aromatic and medicinal properties. This study aimed at to identify fungal endophyte populations associated with healthy and diseased roots of this perennial shrub. Healthy and rotted root samples of D. arayalpathra were collected, fungal endophytes assemblages were identified both by culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches, further sequenced and the retrieved sequences were analysed with the reference sequences in GenBank to know their phylogenetic relationships. Analysis of the ITS rDNA region generated 24 different Ascomycota and three Basidiomycota taxa. Trichoderma sp. was most abundant in healthy and diseased root samples, while Penicillium and Aspergillus were confined to healthy roots. Furthermore, Fusarium solani, Fusarium oxysporum and Mucor velutinosus were found to be the most frequent fungi identified from the rotted root samples, thus substantiated to be the cause for D. arayalpathra decline in the wild. Interestingly, the strains assigned to Fusarium sp. were isolated from diseased roots showing typical clearly visible symptoms, such as a severe brown discolouration on the taproot. Molecular profiling of all the pure fungal isolates, viz., Trichoderma, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium and Mucor, revealed high sequence similarities (\xe2\x89\xa5 98\xc2\xa0%) to corresponding reference sequences. Sequencing of Trichoderma pure cultures isolated from healthy and diseased roots revealed sequence similarities to Trichoderma harzianum, T. hamatum, T. koningiopsis, T. asperellum, T. pubescens and Hypocrea sp. This confirms the morphological examinations, as Hypocrea is the teleomorph stage of Trichoderma sp. This study signifies the first work pertaining to the taxonomy of the fungal endophytic community of D. arayalpathra, and the results reported in this work may help to ascertain the cause of root rot disease often perceived in D. arayalpathra. Also, it could be useful to identify the promising endophytic communities against the root rot diseases occurring in D. arayalpathra.'

Abstract: 'Fungal endophytes of tropical trees are expected to be exceptionally species rich as a consequence of high tree diversity in the tropics and the purported host restriction among the endophytes. Based on this premise, endophytes have been regarded as a focal group for estimating fungal numbers because their possible hyperdiverse nature would reflect significantly global fungal diversity. We present our consolidated ten-year work on 75 dicotyledonous tree hosts belonging to 33 families and growing in three different types of tropical forests of the NBR in the Western Ghats, southern India. We conclude that endophyte diversity in these forests is limited due to loose host affiliations among endophytes. Some endophytes have a wide host range and colonize taxonomically disparate hosts suggesting adaptations in them to counter a variety of defense chemicals in their hosts. Furthermore, such polyphagous endophytes dominate the endophyte assemblages of different tree hosts. Individual leaves may be densely colonized but only by a few endophyte species. It appears that the environment (the type of forest in this case) has a larger role in determining the endophyte assemblage of a plant host than the taxonomy of the host plant. Thus, different tropical plant communities have to be studied for their endophyte diversity to test the generalization that endophytes are hyperdiverse in the tropics, estimate their true species richness, and use them as a predictor group for more accurate assessment of global fungal diversity.'

Abstract: 'Two new species of digenetic trematodes of the genus Pleurogenoides infecting the freshwater frogs, Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis and Hoplobatrachus tigerinus inhabiting the Western Ghats, India are described and illustrated. Pleurogenoides euphlycti n. sp. and P. wayanadensis n. sp. are separated from their congeners on the basis of differences in the morphology and morphometry. The prevalence of infection of P. euphlycti n. sp. in E. cyanophlyctis is 8.99% and in H. tigerinus 12.5% and the intensity is 6.5 and 7.0 respectively. Prevelance of P. wayanadensis n. sp. in E. cyanophlyctis is 4.49% and in H. tigerinus 6.25% and the intensity is 11.25 and 6 respectively. Since trematode parasites have complex life cycles, with multiple hosts that follow trophic level transfer, the parasite larvae may serve as reliable indicators of species diversity in an ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'The genus Atalantia Correa is represented in India with four species and two varieties. The infra \xe2\x80\x94 generic classification and the species limits in Atalantia are, however, not well defined, due to the occurrence of intermediate forms. Two species, A. racemosa Wight and A. monophylla (L.) DC., are widely distributed, while the third species, A. wightii Tanaka is endemic in the Western Ghats, a well-known biodiversity hotspot. PCR-based methods have been commonly used for the assessment of genetic diversity in plants. We report for the first time the genetic diversity within and between populations of the above three species using two Single Primer Amplification Reaction (SPAR) methods. AMOVA analysis clearly indicates the lesser diversity among the species than within them. The UPGMA tree included all of the doubtful species in one single sub-cluster within the major cluster of A. racemosa and A. wightii, suggesting that these are probably hybrids derived from these two species. At the population level, all A. monophylla populations grouped together in a cluster that was clearly separated from all other species and populations.'

Abstract: 'The Western Ghats (WG) of India, one of the hottest biodiversity hotspots in the world, has witnessed major land-use and land-cover (LULC) change in recent times. The present research was aimed at studying the patterns of LULC change in WG during 1985\xe2\x80\x931995\xe2\x80\x932005, understanding the major drivers that caused such change, and projecting the future (2025) spatial distribution of forest using coupled logistic regression and Markov model. The International Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP) classification scheme was mainly followed in LULC characterization and change analysis. The single-step Markov model was used to project the forest demand. The spatial allocation of such forest demand was based on the predicted probabilities derived through logistic regression model. The R statistical package was used to set the allocation rules. The projection model was selected based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) and area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The actual and projected areas of forest in 2005 were compared before making projection for 2025. It was observed that forest degradation has reduced from 1985\xe2\x80\x931995 to 1995\xe2\x80\x932005. The study obtained important insights about the drivers and their impacts on LULC simulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt where projection of future state of forest in entire WG is made based on decadal LULC and socio-economic datasets at the Taluka (sub-district) level.'

Abstract: 'In the Western Ghats of India, amphibians are culled at cardamom plantations since they are perceived to consume cardamom. To better understand the relationship between amphibians and cardamom, a study was undertaken at these plantations, which harbor numerous threatened and range-restricted amphibians. We undertook questionnaire surveys with 298 respondents at 148 plantations across southern India. Time-activity budget and diet analysis surveys were undertaken to determine whether amphibians really consumed cardamom. The conception that amphibians eat cardamom was found to be widespread especially among small-sized plantations, leading to negative perceptions and a lack of interest in amphibian conservation. The plantation community perceives a substantial economic loss due to amphibians, even though this is non-existent as revealed by our field surveys. These perceptions would lead to a continued intolerance of amphibian presence in plantations. A suitable outreach initiative re-affirming facts and spreading awareness on the positive role of amphibians would need to be conducted to negate this age-old myth.'

Abstract: 'Rural people in developing countries including India continue to access a number of types of \xe2\x80\x98forests\xe2\x80\x99 to meet specific needs such as fuelwood, fodder, food, non-timber forest produce and timber for both subsistence and income generation. While a plethora of terms exist to describe the types of forests that rural people use\xe2\x80\x94such as farm forests, social forests, community forests and small-scale forests\xe2\x80\x94the expression domestic forest has recently been proposed. Domestic forest is a term aimed at capturing the diversity of forests transformed and managed by rural communities and a way to introduce a new scientific domain that recognises that production and conservation can be reconciled and that local communities can be effective managers. This paper argues in the context of the central Western Ghats of south India that while the domestic forest concept is a useful umbrella term to capture the diversity of forests used by rural people, these domestic forests are often not autonomous local forests but sites of contestation between local actors and the state forest bureaucracy. Hence, a paradigm shift within the forest bureaucracy will only occur if the scientific forestry community questions its own normative views on forest management and sees forest policy as a means to recognise local claims and support existing practices of forest dependent communities.'

Abstract: 'We used standard isolation protocols to explore the endophytic fungal communities in three tissue types of two dominant orchids (Bulbophyllum neilgherrense and Vanda testacea) of the Kaiga forest of the Western Ghats. We surface sterilized and assessed 90 segments of each orchid for the occurrence and diversity of endophytic fungal taxa. The 118 fungal isolates were obtained from root, bulb and leaves of B. neilgherrense, consisting of 17 anamorphic taxa (range, 10\xe2\x80\x9315 taxa) with 1.3 fungal taxa per segment (range, 1.2\xe2\x80\x931.4 taxa). Four taxa (Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Penicillium sp. and morpho sp. 1) belonged to the core group (11.1%\xe2\x80\x9332.2%). The relative abundance of A. flavus and morpho sp. 1 was more than 10%. A total of 130 fungal isolates from roots, stems and leaves of V. testacea yielded 20 anamorphic taxa (range, 11\xe2\x80\x9315 taxa) with 1.4 fungal taxa per segment (range, 1.4\xe2\x80\x931.5 taxa). Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, A. ochraceus, Gliocladium viride, Penicillium sp. and morpho sp. 1 belonged to the core group. Relative abundance exceeded 10% for A. flavus, A. niger, and morpho sp. 1. The Simpson and Shannon diversity indices were higher in leaf than root or bulb/stem of both orchids. Jaccard\xe2\x80\x99s similarity coefficient was higher between root and leaf in both orchids (56.3%-60%) than between other pairs. Our study revealed that the endophytic fungal assemblage and diversity of B. neilgherrense and V. testacea of Kaiga forest of the Western Ghats were relatively similar between orchids and their tissues.'

Abstract: 'Regulation of streamflow by a reservoir creates a flow regime much different from the pre-impoundment period flow regime. Hydro-Electric Projects (HEPs) commissioned in the Western Ghat regions of the Kerala State, India during the last four decades caused considerable changes in the flow regimes of the rivers of the Kerala State in southwest India. In this paper, the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) approach proposed by Richter et al. (1996) is used to analyze flow regime changes in the Periyar and Muvattupuzha Rivers, due to the construction of the Idukki (1976), Idamalayar (1987) and Lower Periyar (1997) HEPs in the high ranges of the Western Ghats. Normal rainfall years (annual rainfall values within mean \xc2\xb1 0.75 standard deviation limits) are only considered in the analysis to focus on hydrologic alterations due to human activities. The mean hydrologic alteration in the Periyar River (deviation from the pre-development hydrologic indicator values) after commissioning of three HEPs is 35%. Inter-basin water transfer after power generation from the Idukki HEP resulted in a higher discharge in the adjacent Muvattupuzha River, leading to considerable changes in the hydro-environment (mean hydrologic alterations varying between 57 to 63%). IHA parameters showing hydrologic alterations above the 67th Percentile were further analyzed. For each of the pre-construction hydrologic parameters \xc2\xb1 1 standard deviation from the mean is set as the upper and lower management target limits. The values of each IHA parameter beyond these targets are considered as non-attainment. Considerable hydrologic alterations are observed, especially for low flows in both basins. Inter-basin transfer induced larger changes in flow parameters compared to intra-basin regulations. The study shows that under a proper water release and diversion scheme, the non-attainment of IHA parameters (values fall beyond the target limits) can be reduced. The findings of the study will be greatly beneficial to regional water management and restoration of an eco-environmental system in the humid tropical region.'

Abstract: 'The present study has generated spatial databases on the vegetation type with plant biodiversity, forest fragmentation and disturbance regimes in Tamilnadu parts of Eastern Ghats (EG), India. These databases have been analysed geospatially with landscape ecology approach. The study also includes ground inventory of plant species based on Remote Sensing (RS) data stratification. The vegetation type map was generated from the visual interpretation of two season IRS LISS III data. The spatial landscape analysis of the remotely sensed interpreted images was carried out using customized software, SPLAM. This is first such study in Tamilnadu Eastern Ghats that provides a comprehensive spatial database on vegetation types, disturbance regime and plant species diversity. The study has shown that the dry deciduous and thorn forests have shown better resistance to disturbance compared to the most disturbed evergreen and semievergreen forests. The study outputs are being utilized by forest department and biodiversity boards for conservation action planning and compliance to Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).'

Abstract: 'Abundance and biomass of pill millipedes (Arthrosphaera) and earthworms in the forests and plantations of nine study sites in the southwestern India (Western Ghats, foothill of the Western Ghats and the west coast) were surveyed. Out of 10 morphospecies of pill millipedes (Arthrosphaera) recovered, four were identified, and the rest did not match with morphological and taxonomic descriptions. A maximum of five species of Arthrosphaera were recovered from the Western Ghat forests. In forests, the biomass of pill millipedes was higher than earthworms but lower in abundance. In plantations, both biomass and abundance of millipedes were higher than those of earthworms. None of the 12 soil edaphic features (moisture, bulk density, water-holding capacity, temperature, pH, conductivity, organic carbon, P, K, Ca, Mg and litter depth) significantly correlated with millipede biomass in the Western Ghat forests, nor were any soil features correlated with earthworm biomass in the west coast plantations. While all, except for soil moisture, were significantly correlated with earthworm biomass in the Western Ghat forests. In the Western Ghat plantations, the biomass of millipedes was significantly correlated with soil moisture, pH, organic carbon and minerals (P, K and Ca). In the west coast plantations, the biomass of millipedes was significantly correlated with moisture, water-holding capacity, organic carbon, Ca, and Mg, while, in the foothill plantations, only with temperature.'

Abstract: 'Shikimic acid (SA) is a key precursor for synthesis of drug against H5N1 virus. The demand for this compound is met from plant resources, especially from the fruits of Chinese star anise (Ilichium vernum L.). Present study expounds understanding on distribution of SA in various plant species collected from Western Ghats using RP-UFLC analysis. The area under curve obtained after RP-UFLC run were used to comprehend on possible natural groupings and correlations. 14 out of 58 samples yielded SA in an excess of 1\xc2\xa0mg/g and Mammea suriga (Buch.-Ham. ex Roxb.) Kosterm (29.34\xc2\xa0mg/g) being the highest among all. Probably, this is the first report of M. suriga to be accounted for SA content. Higher yielding samples grouped together in hierarchical clustering analysis.'

Abstract: 'The changes in species composition, abundance and forest stand structure were analyzed across altitudinal regimes in tropical forests of Eastern Ghats of northern Andhra Pradesh, India. Three 1-ha plots were established with one each in low, medium and high altitudes. A total of 153 species, 2129 stems (709 stems \xc2\xb7 ha\xe2\x88\x921) of \xe2\x89\xa510 cm girth were enumerated. Species richness and diversity pattern varied along altitudinal gradient and increased with the altitude. Species richness varied from 52 to 110 species\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 and stand density from 639 to 836 stems\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 with average basal area of 34.39 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921. Shannon-Wiener index (H\xe2\x80\xb2) ranged from 4.55 to 5.17. Low altitude (i.e., Site 1) is dominated by Xylia xylocarpa (59.22) and Lagerstroemia parviflora (23.90), medium altitude (i.e., Site 2) by Xylia xylocarpa (45.50) Bursera serrata (17.29), and high altitude (i.e., Site 3) has Schleichera oleosa (28.25) Pterocarpus marsupium (26.55) as predominant species. Taxonomically, Rubiaceae (12 species), Fabaceae (12), Euphorbiaceae (11), Rutaceae (7) and Lauraceae (7) were dominant families. Density-wise, Fabaceae, Combretaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Anacardiaceae and Myrtaceae were abundant. Thus, conservation assessment based on altitudinal regimes and the information on species structure and function can provide baseline information for monitoring and sustaining the biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Malaria is a major global public health problem, and the alarming spread of drug resistance and limited number of effective drugs now available underline how important it is to discover new antimalarial compounds. An ethnopharmacological investigation was undertaken on Western Ghats plants traditionally used to treat malaria in India; 50 plants were very carefully selected from a total of 372 plants, and 200 extracts were prepared and tested for in vitro antiplasmodial activity alone and in combination with chloroquine (CQ) against CQ-resistant Plasmodium falciparum (strain MRC-Pf-43). In in vitro antiplasmodial activity, when plant extract alone is used, 29 extracts (or 14.5%) showed significant high in vitro antiplasmodial activity with IC50 values ranging from 3.96 to 4.85\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml, 53 extracts (or 26.5%) showed significant good in vitro antiplasmodial activity with IC50 values ranging from 5.02 to 9.87\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml, and 28 extracts (or 14%) showed significant moderate in vitro antiplasmodial activity with IC50 values ranging from 10.87 to 14\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml, respectively. In combination with CQ, 103 extracts (or 51.5%) showed significant synergistic in vitro antiplasmodial activities with synergistic factor values ranging from 1.03 to 1.92, and these activities were up to a fold higher with CQ, suggesting synergistic interactions of the two drugs. Our investigation has confirmed that above 62.1% of the plant extracts showed moderate to high in vitro antiplasmodial activity when used alone, and in combination with CQ, 55.7% of the extracts showed borderline to good synergistic activity.'

Abstract: ' Decalepis arayalpathra, a critically endangered plant species, has a restricted and fragmented population in Southern Western Ghats, India. This study is a first attempt to evaluate genetic diversity and population structure in the nine wild populations of D. arayalpathra based on molecular pattern realized through the marker assays. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and Nei\xe2\x80\x99s unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA)-based hierarchical clustering of both the marker assays suggest strong genetic clustering between the individuals corresponding to their geographical ranges. Mantel test also corroborates a close genetic proximity between genetic and geographic data (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.389). Population genetic analysis revealed low levels of gene flow [inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.289 and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.847] between the populations, in line with high genetic differentiation (Gst\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.531 with ISSR and 0.440 with RAPD), which was also supported by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), that 54\xc2\xa0% (ISSR) and 64\xc2\xa0% (RAPD) total variation resided within populations. Bayesian model-based STRUCTURE analysis detected three genetic clusters showing the high degree of admixture within population. Based on the findings, such as inbreeding depression and the loss of genetic diversity, suggestions for conservation strategies are provided to preserve the genetic resources of this endangered species.'

Abstract: 'Only a few Impatiens spp. from South India (one of the five centers of diversity for Impatiens species) were included in the published datum of molecular phylogeny of the family Balsaminaceae. The present investigation is a novel attempt to reveal the phylogenetic association of Impatiens species of South India, by placing them in the global phylogeny of Impatiens based on a combined analysis of two chloroplast genes. Thirty species of genus Impatiens were collected from different locations of South India. Total genomic DNA was extracted from fresh plant leaf, and polymerase chain reaction was carried out using atpB\xe2\x80\x93rbcL and trnL-F intergenic spacer-specific forward and reverse primers. Thirteen sequences of Impatiens species from three centers of diversity were obtained from GenBank for reconstructing the evolutionary relationships within the genus Impatiens. Bayesian inference analysis was carried out in MrBayes v.3.2.2. This analysis supported Southeast Asia as the ancestral place of origin of extant Impatiens species. Molecular phylogeny of South Indian Impatiens spp. based on combined chloroplast sequences showed the same association as that of morphological taxonomy. Sections Scapigerae, Tomentosae, Sub-Umbellatae, and Racemosae showed Southeast Asian relationship, while sections Annuae and Microsepalae showed African affinity.'

Abstract: ' Bidens biternata, belonging to the family Asteraceae, is an erect annual herb, up to 1\xc2\xa0cm in height, and a widespread weed of cultivated areas. This plant is common, particularly in the Western Ghats regions of Kerala state in India. It is used as a leafy vegetable by the Paniya and Kattunaayika tribes of Waynadu Districts in Kerala and also to cure hepatitis, cold, cough, dysentery, etc. The multiplication and utilization of this leafy vegetable will help to overcome the nutritional deficiency problem and also to maintain the biodiversity. For effective biochemical analysis, plant extract was taken using different solvents. Various phytochemicals like reducing sugar, glycosides, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, steroids, terpenoids, coumarins, saponins, anthraquinones, phlobatannins and iridoids were estimated. Different nutritional factors like total carbohydrates, total proteins, total reducing sugar, different amino acids, free fatty acids, crude fibre, lipids, total moisture content, vitamins, etc. were tested by standard estimation methods. Anti-nutritional factors like phytic acid, total phenol, tannic acid, etc., were also estimated. Micronutrients and different pigments were quantified. The present studies revealed that this wild leafy plant has numerous nutritional factors with a low level of anti-nutritional factors. Therefore, this nutritive herb with diverse health-promoting compounds can be effectively utilized to overcome the nutritional deficiency problem around the globe.'

Abstract: 'Climate change, alien species, and use of land for intensive farming and development are causing severe threat to the plant genetic diversity worldwide. Hence, conservation of biodiversity is considered fundamental and also provides the livelihoods to millions of people worldwide. Medicinal plants play a key role in the treatment of a number of diseases, and they are only the source of medicine for majority of people in the developing world. The tropical regions of the world supply the bulk of current global demand for \xe2\x80\x9cnatural medicine,\xe2\x80\x9d albeit with increasing threat to populations in the world and its genetic diversity. India is a major center of origin and diversity of crop and medicinal plants. India poses out 20,000 species of higher plants, one third of it being endemic and 500 species are categorized to have medicinal value. The Western Ghats is one of the major repositories of medicinal plants. It harbors around 4,000 species of higher plants of which 450 species are threatened. Currently, the number of species added to the red list category in this region is increasing, and the valuable genetic resources are being lost at a rapid rate. Demand for medicinal plants is increasing, and this leads to unscrupulous collection from the wild and adulteration of supplies. Providing high-quality planting material for sustainable use and thereby saving the genetic diversity of plants in the wild is important. During the last 25\xc2\xa0years of intensive research, Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute has developed in vitro protocol for rapid regeneration and establishment of about 40 medicinally important rare and threatened plants of Western Ghats. In situ conservation alone would not be effective in safeguarding these important species. Thus, utilizing the biotechnoligical approach to complement ex situ conservation program is becoming vital. Propagating biotechnology tools in plant conservation program is a prerequisite to succeed in sustainable use and to complement the existing ex situ measures. In addition to propagation, storage of these valuable genetic resources is equally important. In vitro slow growth of 35 species and cryopreservation using embryo/meristem/seed in 20 different species of rare medicinal plants of this region is accomplished. Plants developed in vitro of ten medicinal plants, which have restricted distribution, were reintroduced in the natural habitat as well.'

Abstract: 'We have quantitatively analyzed the tree species diversity with respect to soil nutrient status in three sites of a sacred forest ecosystem of Niyamgiri hill range, Eastern Ghats, India. Extensive field surveys and sampling were conducted in 3 sites of the hill range: Site 1 Pterocarpus dominated forest (PTF) (19\xc2\xb040\xe2\x80\xb202.2\xe2\x80\xb3 N and 83\xc2\xb021\xe2\x80\xb223.1\xe2\x80\xb3 E), Site 2 Mangifera dominated forest (MAF) (19\xc2\xb040\xe2\x80\xb202.8\xe2\x80\xb3 N and 83\xc2\xb021\xe2\x80\xb240.8\xe2\x80\xb3 E) and Site 3 Mixed forest (MIF) (19\xc2\xb036\xe2\x80\xb247.1\xe2\x80\xb3 N and 83\xc2\xb021\xe2\x80\xb202.7\xe2\x80\xb3 E). A total of 28 families, 42 genera, 46 tree species, and 286 individual trees were recorded on an area of 0.6 ha. Tree density varied between 470 and 490 individuals ha\xe2\x88\x921 and average basal area between 3.16 and 10.04 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921. Shannon Index (H\xe2\x80\xb2) ranged from 2.34 to 4.53, Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s Index ranged from 0.07 to 0.09, and equitability Index ranged from 0.7 to 1.34. The number of individuals was highest in the girth at breast height (GBH) class of 50\xe2\x80\x9370 cm. The soil nutrient status of the three forest types was related to tree species diversity. The soil pH value of the three sites reflected the slightly acidic nature of the area. Species diversity was positively correlated with organic carbon and phosphorus and negatively with nitrogen, EC and pH. The results of the current study may be helpful to further develop a conservation plan for tree species in tropical sacred forest ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'We assessed the distribution and abundance of 4 species of diurnal primates viz. lion-tailed macaque, bonnet macaque, Nilgiri langur and Hanuman langur, in 2 areas\xe2\x80\x94Brahmagiri-Makut and Sirsi-Honnavara\xe2\x80\x94in rain forests of the Western Ghats in the state of Karnataka, India. The Nilgiri langurs in Brahmagiri-Makut and the lion-tailed macaques in Sirsi-Honnavara are the northernmost populations of the 2 species in the Western Ghats. The 2 regions represent changes in ecological zones in the Western Ghats. In Brahmagiri-Makut, Hanuman langurs and bonnet macaques occupy lower elevations whereas Nilgiri langurs live in relatively higher altitudes. Only one group of lion-tailed macaques was in Brahmagiri-Makut. In the forests of Sirsi-Honnavara, 3 species of primates viz. lion-tailed macaque, bonnet macaque and Hanuman langur were in larger numbers throughout the forest. A self-sustainable single population of 32 groups of lion-tailed macaques occurred in Sirsi-Honnavara. Few subspecies of Hanuman langurs exist in the study regions. Due to local hunting practices, the relative abundance of primates in Brahmagiri-Makut is lower than that in Sirsi-Honnavara.'

Abstract: 'Psychotria flavida Talbot. an endemic plant of Western Ghats was explored for endophytic mycoflora. The endophytic fungi isolated from leaf and stem were identified with the aid of morphology and molecular methods. Lasiodiplodia theobromae and Picchia guillermondii were commonly present in both the sites. Overall colonization frequency of leaf samples was found to be higher than stem samples in both the places. Studies on seasonal variation of the occurrence of these fungi indicated a higher frequency during winter as compared to monsoon and summer. Further, endophytic fungi were verified for bioactive diagnosis using in vitro antimicrobial (disc diffusion method) and antioxidant (DPPH free radical scavenging). Among the 15 crude extracts of different endophytes tested, the extracts of Lasiodiplodia theobromae possessed potentially better antibacterial and antioxidant activity. The present study divulges that the endophytic fungi L. theobromae could be a potential source of antimicrobial and antioxidant drugs.'

Abstract: 'In order to understand the vegetative and reproductive phenological behaviour of Syzygium caryophyllatum, the knowledge of the factor influencing leaf flushing, maturation, leaf fall, flowering and fruiting of this tree species is required. The authors used field observations collected over 3\xc2\xa0years (2012\xe2\x80\x932015) at Neeliyarkottam sacred grove, Kannur district, Western Ghats of Kerala, India, to characterize the relationship between phenological pattern and biotic and abiotic (climatic) factors. The relationship between phenological pattern of the selected species and abiotic variables such as precipitation and temperature exhibited significant variation among the species. Flowering begins from second week of March to till May with a peak in April followed by the fruiting. Hand pollination tests indicated that most of the fruits were developed through xenogamous pollination. The breeding test results indicated S. caryophyllatum is self-incompatible and out-crossing is fertile. The foraging activities of some common pollinators on S. caryophyllatum flowers were also studied. The main flower visitors and foragers include honey bees, different varieties of butterflies, wasps, carpenter bees, small flies, bugs and ants. The flowering and fruiting exclusively occur in the dry season and are followed by germination and establishment of seedlings during the subsequent rainy season. The authors conclude that the investigations on the reproductive phenology, floral biology, breeding systems and pollinator visitation are important due to population survival of the species and its evolutionary success.'

Abstract: ' Oryza malampuzhaensis Krish.et Chand. (2n = 4x = 48; Poaceae,Oryza) is endemic to Western Ghats, South India, and shows a highly localized distribution over a small geographical area in this region. This is the most poorly understood taxon in genusOryza and is often misidentified asO. officinalis owing to their close morphology. We assessed the nature and distribution of genetic variation among 11 populations ofO. malampuzhaensis using random amplified polymorphic DNA markers. The analysis revealed low genetic variation inO. malampuzhaensis. Cluster analysis of pairwise genetic distances of populations revealed three distinct clusters and the grouping of populations largely corresponded to their geographical proximity. Restricted gene flow and a geography-dependent differentiation were evident among populations. The altitude-influenced differences in ecological factors among the natural habitats of the populations seem to be the cause of the geography-dependent differentiation. Genetically isolated smaller populations and a narrow genetic base inO. malampuzhaensis point to its vulnerability to genetic drift and genetic depauperation. ThusO. malampuzhaensis appears to be under the threat of extinction and needs to be conserved by use of suitable methods. The present study also identified molecular markers diagnostic forO. malampuzhaensis.'

Abstract: ' Musa acuminata ssp. burmannica, one of the wild progenitors contributing \xe2\x80\x98A genome\xe2\x80\x99 to the present-day dessert bananas, has a long evolutionary history intervened by human activities. In this study, ISSR markers were used to analyze the pattern of genetic variation and differentiation in 32 individuals along with two reference samples (viz., Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides, var. Calcutta 4 and Musa balbisiana) of wild Musa, which corresponded to three populations across the biodiversity-rich hot spot of southern Western Ghats of India. High levels of genetic diversity were revealed both at the species and population levels, using Nei\xe2\x80\x99s diversity indices. The hierarchical analysis of molecular variance showed pronounced genetic differentiation, as 96\xc2\xa0% of the total variance was fixed within population and only 4\xc2\xa0% among populations. Nei\xe2\x80\x99s genetic differentiation coefficient (G ST\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.1823) and low gene flow (Nm\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01.18) further confirmed this. The positive correlation (Mantel test) between geographic distance and genetic distance (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.338 P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001) indicates geographic isolation as one of the key factors in shaping the population genetic structure. Grouping of individuals was largely in conformity with their spatial distribution, which was confirmed by UPGMA cluster analysis and PCA scatter plot clustering all 32 individuals into three major groups along a geographical gradient. The discontinuous distribution and dwindling population due to habitat fragmentation are serious threats to prevailing genetic diversity in this species. Conservation measures based on diversity pattern are suggested for long-term preservation and sustainable utilization of this precious genetic resource.'

Abstract: 'Satellite remote sensing is a proven tool for mapping landuse patterns and estimating vegetation biomass/carbon. Present study aims at estimating the potential of forests of Radhanagari WLS (Western Ghats, India) to sequester the atmospheric carbon-di-oxide, using ground based observations coupled with satellite remote sensing. The study area was stratified for dominant forest types based on the structure and composition of vegetation and elevation variations. Permanent sample plots were laid down in these homogeneous vegetation strata (HVS) to make different observations during time 1 and time 2. Carbon sequestration by plantations was also studied and compared with natural forests. Species and area-specific biomass equations were used for estimating carbon pool and sequestration. Among natural forests \xe2\x80\x98mixed moist deciduous\xe2\x80\x99 forests exhibited highest sequestration rate (8%), whereas, plantation as obvious had a comparatively higher sequestration rate than natural forests (20.27%). Total carbon sequestration by forests of the Radhanagari WLS between 2004 and 2006 is 78742.09 tons. Eligible land for reforestation activity under clean development mechanism (CDM) of Kyoto Protocol was identified using satellite remote sensing using 1989 and 2005 datasets and it was observed that the potential land that can be used for reforestation activity is 10080 ha.'

Abstract: 'Macro and microhabitat analyses were applied to characterise the fish assemblage structure in 10 streams of the Western Ghat mountains of Peninsular India. Macrohabitat features, such as channel gradient, stream depth, stream width, riparian cover, instream cover, habitat types and substrates, were used. Microhabitat requirements of the abundant cyprinids (35 species) were also analysed. Macrohabitat assessment indicated that a high habitat diversity was associated with a high species diversity, and that habitat volume was a major determining factor for species diversity and abundance. In all streams, cyprinids were the dominant group in the assemblage and almost all cyprinids were confined to pools with a varied habitat diversity. Riffle dwelling species included ancient forms such as Glyptothorax madraspatnum, G. trewasae and Homaloptera santhamparaiensis. Suitable microhabitats for dominant cyprinid species were pools and riffle edges. Big-sized barbs and mahseers such as Hypselobarbus dobsoni, H. curmuca, H. dubius, Labeo calbasu, Puntius sarana, Tor khudree and Tor khudree malabaricus were confined to deep pools with a large area. Smaller Puntius species like P. fasciatus, P. melanampyx, P. narayani, P. sophore, P. ticto and P. vittatus lived in shallow backwater pools and pools with low flow. Species like P. arulius tambiraparniei, P. amphibius, P. bimaculatus and P. filamentosus were found towards shallow pools with moderate flow. Surface-dwelling species such as Danio aequipinnatus, Rasbora daniconius, Salmostoma spp. and Barilius spp. preferred deepwater habitats with high flow. Habitat-based multivariate analysis revealed four guilds: surface dwellers, column dwellers, generalized bottom dwellers and specialized bottom dwellers.'

Abstract: 'Saraca asoca (Roxb.) De Wilde is a valuable tree used in traditional medicine against a variety of ailments. Almost all parts of the tree are used for various commercial herbal preparations. Due to overexploitation, the species is rapidly disappearing from Western Ghats where it is native and grew extensively until recently. Conservation of this important medicinal plant is therefore an urgent need. To plan effective conservation strategies, a scientific assessment of the genetic diversity and distribution is needed.'

Abstract: 'The Western Ghats plays a pivotal role in determining the hydrological and hydroclimatic regime of Peninsular India. The mountainous catchments of the Ghats are the primary contributors of flow in the rivers that sustains the life and agricultural productivity in the area. Although many studies have been conducted in the past decades to understand long term trends in the meteorological and hydrological variables of major river basins, not much attention have been made to unfold the relationship existing among rainfall and river hydrology of natural drainages on either side of the Western Ghats which host one of the unique biodiversity hotspots across the world. Therefore, an attempt has been made in this paper to examine the short term (last three decades) changes in the rainfall pattern and its influence on the hydrological characteristics of some of the important rivers draining the southern Western Ghats as a case study. The short term, annual and seasonal trends in the rainfall, and its variability and discharge were analyzed using Mann-Kendall test and Sen\xe2\x80\x99s estimator of slope. The study showed a decreasing trend in rainfall in the southwest monsoon while a reverse trend is noticed in northeast monsoon. Correspondingly, the discharge of the west and east flowing rivers also showed a declining trend in the southwest monsoon season. The runoff coefficient also followed the trends in the discharge. The runoff coefficient of the Periyar river showed a decreasing trend, whereas the Cauvery river exhibited an increasing trend. A high-resolution analysis of rainfall data revealed that the number of moderate rainfall events showed a decreasing trend throughout the southern Western Ghats, whereas the high intensity rainfall events showed an opposite trend. The decline in groundwater level in the areas which recorded an increase in high intensity rainfall events and decrease in moderate rainfall events showed that the groundwater recharge process is significantly affected by changes in the rainfall pattern of the area.'

Abstract: '\nThe current distribution of Cajanus lineatus in the forest area of the Western Ghats including Kumbharli Ghat, Mahabaleshwar, Lonavala, Khandala and Sinhgarh, from where the species was reported earlier, was estimated. The extensive exploration of these areas revealed that Cajanus lineatus is facing severe threat of habitat loss/fragmentation due to anthropogenic activities. Very few fragmented populations with a small number of plants such as one or two individuals were found and most of them had vanished when visited subsequently. The species almost disappeared from most of the native places as urbanization and road constructions have increased importantly. Cajanus lineatus prefers open places, mainly targeted by these activities. Hence, the present situation of the habitat-specific C. lineatus in these areas is alarming and very soon the species will be at the verge of extinction.\n'

Abstract: ' In northern Western Ghats (India), four tropical habitats with different disturbance levels were monitored for diversity and seasonal patterns in butterfly communities. Species richness was highest in late monsoon and early winter. Majority of the butterfly species also showed abundance peaks in these seasons. Fire played a significant role in determining species composition in fire-afflicted areas and affected flight periods of some species but did not affect species richness. Grazing had a major impact on species composition and it favoured only those Lycaenids and Nymphalids whose caterpillars feed on herbs. In case of one of the sites where phenophases of the larval foodplant and population trend of a small Lycaenid was documented, the population showed rapid increase at the time when the plants were in suitable phenophase for growth of the caterpillars. A possible evolutionary interaction between herb-feeding and non-herb-feeding Lycaenids is proposed.'

Abstract: 'Parental care has evolved many times in multiple taxa and, by definition, enhances offspring survivorship. Anurans exhibit a diverse array of parental care behaviors, but studies examining their adaptive significance in an evolutionary context are limited. The critically endangered bush frog, Raorchestes chalazodes (Rhacophoridae), only breeds inside hollow internodes of the endemic bamboo (Ochlandra travancorica) in the southern Western Ghats of India from June through October. From systematic surveys, we established that adult males are sole caregivers exhibiting egg attendance and egg guarding behavior. Predation was the main cause of egg mortality in the absence of an attending male; the majority of predation events were caused by conspecific males. The results highlight the role of regional and microhabitat-specific selection pressures such as strong seasonality, limited resources, and competition for oviposition sites. Oviposition sites are in high demand, but in short supply and by consuming unattended eggs, the conspecific male may benefit from nutritional gains as well as mating opportunities at the oviposition site. Our work lays foundations for further examination of social and reproductive behaviors of anurans not only in the Western Ghats but also in South and Southeast Asia.'

Abstract: 'Cultivation based and culture independent molecular approaches were used to characterize the composition and structure of bacterial community from a natural warm spring in the Western Ghats, a biodiversity \xe2\x80\x98hotspot\xe2\x80\x99. Dilution plating was done on three types of media with varying nutrient levels. Relatively nutritionally poor medium supported growth of highest number of bacteria (4.98\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0103\xc2\xa0ml\xe2\x88\x921) compared to nutritionally rich media. On the basis of different morphological features on the plate, 62 aerobic and heterotrophic bacterial strains were isolated and their 16S rRNA genes were sequenced and analyzed. On the basis of sequence similarity these isolates were found to be distributed in 21 different genera belonging to Proteobacteria (58%) followed by Firmicutes (26%), Actinobacteria (13%) and Bacteroidetes (3%). Amplification of 16S rRNA gene of the community DNA using eubacterial primers, followed by cloning and sequencing revealed that predominant members of the habitat belong to the phylum Cyanobacteria (60%) followed by Proteobacteria (19.5%), Bacteroidetes (6.67%), Actinobacteria (4.4%) and Firmicutes (2.2%) and small ribosomal subunit of a plastid (of Chlorophyta, 2.2%).'

Abstract: 'Sacred groves are patches of forests preserved for their spiritual and religious significance. The practice gained relevance with the spread of agriculture that caused large-scale deforestation affecting biodiversity and watersheds. Sacred groves may lose their prominence nowadays, but are still relevant in Indian rural landscapes inhabited by traditional communities. The recent rise of interest in this tradition encouraged scientific study that despite its pan-Indian distribution, focused on India\xe2\x80\x99s northeast, Western Ghats and east coast either for their global/importance or unique ecosystems. Most studies focused on flora, mainly angiosperms, and the faunal studies concentrated on vertebrates while lower life forms were grossly neglected. Studies on ecosystem functioning are few although observations are available. Most studies attributed watershed protection values to sacred groves but hardly highlighted hydrological process or water yield in comparison with other land use types. The grove studies require diversification from a stereotyped path and must move towards creating credible scientific foundations for conservation. Documentation should continue in unexplored areas but more work is needed on basic ecological functions and ecosystem dynamics to strengthen planning for scientifically sound sacred grove management.'

Abstract: 'Diurnal periodicity of abundance (total, male and female) and behavior (resting, feeding and croaking) of the frogs Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis, E. hexadactylus and Hoplobatrachus tigerinus inhabiting in ponds of the Western Ghats at different altitudes (high, mid and foothill) have been investigated during three seasons (monsoon, post-monsoon and summer). Irrespective of seasons, the air and water temperatures were significantly lower during night than day in all locations (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001) and the humidity was significantly higher in high-altitude (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05) than other locations. Total abundance was significantly high only during night in mid-altitude inhabiting frog E. hexadactylus (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05). The resting behavior was significantly lower during night than day in all frogs, while it was opposite for croaking behavior. The feeding behavior was significantly higher during day than night in E. cyanophlyctis (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05). Total abundance was significantly correlated with abundance of females. Three hourly observations up to 24\xc2\xa0h revealed consistently high total as well as female abundance during monsoon than other seasons. The resting and feeding behaviors of frogs gradually decreased from day towards night, while croaking behavior gradually increased from 5\xc2\xa0pm onwards and reached a peak at 8\xc2\xa0pm and decreased further. Studies on the influence of environmental variables on the behavior of frogs in their native/natural habitats and in mesocosms will be rewarding to follow up their rehabilitation and conservation.'

Abstract: ' Mating behaviour of four species of pill-millipedes under genus Arthrosphaera Pocock (Arthrosphaera dalyi Pocock and Arthrosphaera disticta Pocock, Arthrosphaera fumosa Pocock and Arthrosphaera magna Attems) endemic to the Western Ghats of Southern India was analyzed in mesocosms. Stridulation is a classical communication signal in males as well as females for mate selection. Conglobation (or volvation) is a mechanism of defence to protect from disturbance or avoid predation. If male touches female or vice versa they conglobate. To avoid disparity among individuals of the same species, volvating pill-millipedes evolved stridulation behaviour for communication. The male broadcasts appropriate signal to female through stridulation to advertise its interest in mating. The females test the male\xe2\x80\x99s fitness by conglobation and suitable male uncoils the partner through stridulation signals. Male with its pygidium successfully uncoils the female and attains suitable orientation for courtship. Male pairs with female ventro\xe2\x80\x93ventro contact in opposite direction to deposit sperm into the vulva of female. The duration of mating varies from species to species and usually a lapse from 3 to 30\xc2\xa0min. Vibration generated by stridulation is species-specific and its perception mechanism in pill-millipedes is yet to be clearly understood. Present study emphasized the structure of stridulatory organs, mechanism of stridulation and pattern of mating behaviour in four species of pill-millipedes.'

Abstract: ' Coscinium fenestratum is a critically endangered medicinal plant, well-known for its bioactive isoquinoline alkaloid berberine. The species has been over harvested from its natural habitats to meet the huge requirement of raw drug market and industrial consumption. This has lead to a rapid decline in the population size and has also led to local population extinction at few locations in the Western Ghats, India. In this study, inter-simple sequence repeat markers were used to investigate the genetic variation and population structure of seven extant populations of C. fenestratum from the central Western Ghats, India. Eight primer combination produced a total of 57 unambiguous bands, of which (47.1\xc2\xa0%) were polymorphic. The species exhibited a moderate to low level of intra population genetic diversity (H s\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.347\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.008; H t\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.378\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.006 (POPGENE) and H s\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.262\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.0028; H t\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.204\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.020 (HICKORY)). The populations were low to moderately differentiated from one another (G ST\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.221) and geographical distance was not significantly correlated with genetic distance, suggesting that these long-lived, geographically distant remnant populations were once connected through gene flow. There was a significant amount of genetic variation among populations (19.85\xc2\xa0%). The Bayesian software STRUCTURE and HICKORY were used to further reveal the genetic structure of C. fenestratum. The results revealed weak population structure (K\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa02) with one single widespread gene pool, and indicated that gene flow and inbreeding are likely to be the major driving force in shaping current population genetic structure of C. fenestratum. Thus, an understanding of the genetic diversity and population structure of C. fenestratum can provide insight into the conservation and management of this species.'

Title: 'Molecular phylogeny of Ceropegia (Asclepiadoideae, Apocynaceae) from Indian Western Ghats'

Abstract: ' Ceropegia includes more than 200 species distributed in the Old World ranging from the Canary Islands to Australia. In India, there are about 50 species described on a morphological basis as belonging to Ceropegia, and most of them are endemic to the Western Ghats. To investigate evolutionary relationships among Indian Ceropegia taxa and their allies, a phylogenetic analysis was conducted to include 31 Indian taxa of Ceropegia and Brachystelma and their congeners from other geographical regions using nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and three noncoding chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequences, including intergenic spacers trnT-L and trnL-F, and trnL intron. The Western Ghats Ceropegia species were found to be most closely related to Indian Brachystelma, with the two genera being placed sister to each other in the ITS phylogeny or with the Brachystelma clade nested within one of the two subclades of Indian Ceropegia in the cpDNA phylogeny. In contrast, Ceropegia species from other regions and African Brachystelma all formed separate clades basal to the Indian Ceropegia\xe2\x80\x93Brachystelma clade. Thus, it can be concluded that the classical morphology-based delineation of the two genera needs revision to reflect their phylogenetic relationships, which are more in accordance with their geographical origin than with morphology.'

Title: 'Factors Affecting Recruitment of a Critically-Endangered Dipterocarp Species, Vateria indica in the Western Ghats, India'

Abstract: ' Vateria indica is a critically-endangered and economically-important tree endemic to the Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot in India. Due to extreme local endemism and anthropogenic destructive harvesting of resin, the species is categorized as critically endangered. The present study investigated the biotic limiting factors of recruitment of V. inidica in its natural populations, and studied the pattern of anthropogenic harvest of nuts of V. indica in the recent past. Seed predation and seedling herbivory particularly by insects were assessed. The sustainability of the nut harvest was assessed by conducting pre- and post-harvest censuses of nuts on forest floors. Over 90\xc2\xa0% of the fruits of V. indica were infested by the insects, but, only about 10\xc2\xa0% of the infested fruits were seed-predated. Seedling herbivores included a leaf miner, ants of two species, and larvae of a lymantrid moth. Seedling mortality due to herbivores was moderate (45.5\xc2\xa0%). Pre- and post-harvest censuses showed that only 3.81\xc2\xa0% of the fruits that were naturally-fallen on the forest floor were spared after the harvest had taken place. Sringeri has exported 820 metric tons of nuts in the study year, which was an all-time high estimate. The study concludes that the anthropogenic nut collection can hamper the population structure of V. indica locally. Since V. indica has an alternate-year major flowering cycle, the seed loss as seen in the present study is critical. Raising plantations of V. indica as an afforestation program can contribute to the conservation of the species and the development of local communities.'

Abstract: 'There are no comprehensive reports available on impact of shaded and un-shaded coffee agrosystems on soil biology and microbiological processes. The present study compared the changes in soil biological and microbiological attributes along with coffee quality under different levels of shade and elevation for coffee in India. Significantly (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) higher bulk density was observed in low elevation with open patch/no shade (LEOP) as compared to high elevation with thick shade (HETS). Low elevation with thick shade (LETS) recorded significantly higher water holding capacity (55.47\xc2\xa0%) as compared to high elevation with open patch (HEOP) (44.3\xc2\xa0%). Significantly higher organic carbon was observed in samples from shaded area (1.52\xc2\xa0%) as compared to no shade (0.9\xc2\xa0%). As compared to low elevation, higher available nitrogen (376\xc2\xa0kg/ha), available phosphorus and exchangeable potassium content was found to be significantly higher in samples of high elevation. Significantly (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01) higher soil respiration rate and urease activity was observed in the treatment LEOP, whereas higher dehydrogenase and fluorescein diacetate activity were indicated in HETS and HEOP treatments respectively. High elevation with thick or no shade treatments indicated significantly higher soil micro and macro-fauna population as compared to low elevation with thick or no shade. Significantly higher microbial population was recorded in HETS followed by LETS, whereas Shannon diversity index (H\xe2\x80\xb2), Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s dominance index (D), and Shannon evenness (SE) were found to be similar for HETS, HEOP, and LETS treatments. Better cup characteristics were observed with coffee grown at HETS in comparison with low elevation grown coffee.'

Abstract: ' The Narippara area, which is nestled in the Banasuramala of Wayanad district, witnessed initiation of landslide, which was manifested in the form of curvilinear cracks running for a length of 170\xc2\xa0m. In the event of continuous rainfall, these cracks may get reactivated, leading to a major landslide. This could affect the life and livelihood of a large number of families living downslope and could cause extensive damage to property. Extensive mining for building stones in this area has been a cause for much concern amongst the local population. This study aims at understanding the impact of quarrying on slope stability through geotechnical, geophysical and environmental impact assessment (EIA). Geotechnical analysis shows that the area is stable under dry condition but parts of the area are critical under wet and saturated conditions. Moreover, resistivity studies revealed that the cracks that had developed extend up to the bedrock and the suspected mechanism of failure will be translational in nature. EIA reveal that due to quarrying and mining operations, the possibility of land disturbances cannot be ruled out during the monsoon season. In the present study, an attempt is also made to suggest management strategies for mitigating further effects of landslides in this area.'

Abstract: 'Endophytic actinomycetes were isolated from Combretum latifolium Blume (Combretaceae),Western Ghats of Southern India and identified by its characteristic culture morphology and molecular analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences. In this survey of endophytic actinomycetes, a total of 117 isolates representing 9 different genera of endophytic actinomycetes were obtained using four different isolation media and several of them seemed to be novel taxa. Streptomyces genera (35%) was the most frequently isolated strains, followed by Nocordiopsis (17%) and Micromonospora (13%). ISP-4 medium recovered more isolates (47%) when compared to rest of the media used. Preliminary antibacterial activity of the isolates was carried out by confrontation test. Ethyl acetate fraction of selected isolates in disc diffusion assay exhibited broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against test human pathogens. All Streptomyces spp. strains displayed significant antimicrobial activity against test pathogens. Strain CLA-66 and CLA-68 which are Nocordipsis spp. inhibited both bacterial and fungal pathogens where as other isolates inhibited atleast three test human pathogens in disc diffusion assay. Antimicrobial screening of endophytic actinomycetes from this host may represent a unique potential niche for antimicrobial compounds of industrial and pharmaceutical applications. This work is the first comprehensive report on incidence of potential endophytic actinomycetes inhabiting C. latifolium Blume.'

Abstract: ' A survey of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) status of plants growing in the Western Ghats region of Southern India was undertaken. Root and soil samples of plants growing in the four vegetation types forest, grassland, scrub, and cultivated land or plantation were examined. Of the 329 species (representing 61 families) examined, 174 were mycorrhizal. AM association was recorded in 81 species for the first time, including species from several families assumed to be non-mycorrhizal, e.g. Amaranthaceae, Capparaceae, Commelinaceae, Cyperaceae and Portulacaceae. AM fungal spores of 35 species belonging to Acaulospora, Gigaspora, Glomus, Sclerocystis and Scutellospora were recorded. AM fungal species richness was found to be highest in scrub and lowest in agricultural and plantation soils. Mean colonization levels were dependent on plant life-form, life-cycle pattern and vegetation type.'

Abstract: 'Teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) is one of the most durable timbers in the world that is used for all conceivable purposes. Its widespread use has constrained the distribution of species to small and isolated populations. The genetic structure within and between nine natural teak growing forests of the Western Ghats of India belonging to the states of Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu was investigated using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to provide reasoned scientific management practices and conservation measures. The use of ten selective primer combinations on 180 samples (9 populations X 20 trees) resulted in a total of 665 bands of which 99.4\xc2\xa0% were polymorphic. Gene diversity index (H) varied from 0.1387 (Barchi) to 0.2449 (Wayanad). The mean gene diversity (HS) was 0.1995 and the total gene diversity (HT) was 0.264. The Southern Western Ghats populations showed higher within population gene diversity. The relative magnitude of genetic differentiation among populations (GST) was 0.244. Positive correlation between genetic and geographical distances was observed. PCoA, UPGMA and STRUCTURE analyses revealed the tendency of the individual trees within a population to align together indicating specific identity of each population. In the UPGMA dendrogram, Nilambur population joined separately with a large cluster in which the other Kerala populations and Tamil Nadu population formed sub clusters indicating a separate identity for Nilambur population among Southern Western Ghats populations.'

Abstract: 'The Western Ghats form a major mountain belt, next to the Himalayas, in controlling the flux of water and carbon to the northern Indian Ocean. This study attempts to understand the water and carbon cycles in two humid tropical river basins with its streams originating at higher altitudes of the Western Ghats, India. Water and suspended particulate matter (SPM) were collected on a monthly scale during summer monsoon season (June-September) from Swarna and Nethravati rivers draining into the Arabian Sea. For the source apportionment, samples have been measured for stable isotopes of oxygen (\xce\xb418O) and hydrogen (\xce\xb42H) in water and stable isotopes of carbon (\xce\xb413CPOC) in particulate organic matter (POM) at spatial scale from tributaries and main channel of rivers, and runoff water from agricultural land (dominant paddy field) and forest in the downstream region. The association between \xce\xb418O and deuterium-excess in river water and rain water shows that water in these tropical basins depicts rainout effect of marine source moisture during the onset of summer monsoon. As the monsoon intensifies, the fresher rain water replenishes older water stored previously in sub surface soil layer leading to its flushing into the river during summer monsoon season. Stable carbon isotope ratio and elemental ratio of POM (\xce\xb413CPOC = -27.1 \xc2\xb1 0.4 \xe2\x80\xb0 and C/N = 8.1 \xc2\xb1 1.7) in two humid tropical river water during summer monsoon season is an admixture of suspended particulates from runoff water of forest (\xce\xb413CPOC = - 27.82 \xc2\xb1 0.4 \xe2\x80\xb0) and agricultural land (\xce\xb413CPOC = -26.29 \xc2\xb1 0.4 \xe2\x80\xb0). It is found that \xce\xb413CPOC shows minimal variability with SPM content and C/N ratio within the same organic carbon pool. The study emphasizes the need to consider the agricultural runoff contribution to the rivers while establishing the global elemental budget and observing the global climate change.'

Abstract: ' Decalepis arayalpathra popularly used as an effective remedy for peptic ulcer, gastric antisecretory and cancer-like afflictions with an immunomodulatory property. This study was conducted to unravel the chemical composition of the tuberous root and bioactivities of the compounds in the fractions of antioxidant activity by using large-scale multi-targeted approach, which is still unexplored. Methanolic extract (EM) and its sequential fraction (EC: chloroform extract, EEA: ethyl acetate extract, EB: butanol extract, EA: aqueous extract) were used for qualitative and quantitative \nevaluation of phytocompounds present in the tuberous root of the plant. The characterization of 2H4MB and chlorogenic acid by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was also performed with the help of standard compound. The results revealed the extract to be rich in phenolics, tannins, flavonoids, carbohydrate, saponin and alkaloids. EM proved to be a compatible solvent for the extraction and corresponds to maximum numbers of phytocompounds followed by its fraction (EB, EA, EEA and EC). EM, EB and EEA were further subjected for gas chromatography\xe2\x80\x93mass spectrometry (GC\xe2\x80\x93MS) analysis, which revealed the presence of more than 20 different bioactive compounds. The methanolic extract and its successive fractions were also screened for the antioxidant activity using different prototype. 2H4MB and chlorogenic acid quantified by HPLC in methanol extract was 11.22 and 9.67\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml respectively. The reported compound might be responsible for the potent antioxidant property of the plant. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the analysis of the chemical composition and the bioactive potential of the compounds obtained by extract of D. arayalpathra. '

Abstract: 'Carbon stock distribution in the protected areas (PAs) of India is rarely studied, although they constitute 21.34% of the geographical area under forest cover. A quantitative assessment of ecosystem service is used here to evaluate the PAs of India in terms of storage and spatial distribution of carbon stocks. The area selected for the study was Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR), in the Southern Western Ghats, a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site. Carbon storage on a land parcel largely depends on the amount of five carbon pools: aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, dead wood, litter, and soil organic matter. The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model uses land cover types and data on the stocks in the five carbon pools to estimate the amount of carbon stored in a landscape. The InVEST model is multiservice and has a modular design that provides an effective tool for exploring the likely outcomes of alternative management and climate scenarios and for evaluating trade-offs among sectors and services. The results showed that the average carbon (C) stock in the study area was 76\xc2\xa0t/ha, and a sum of 15.43 million tons were stored in PTR. The multiservice, modular design of the ecosystem service analysis provides decision-makers an effective tool for evaluating and managing natural resources.'

Abstract: 'The main objective of this study is to integrate satellite derived forest burnt areas over a multi-decadal scale to understand fire frequencies in Silent Valley National Park, Kerala, India. There are nine vegetation types distinguished i.e. wet evergreen forest, shola, semi evergreen forest, moist deciduous forest, dry deciduous forest, savannah, reed brakes, scrub and grasslands using Resoursesat-2 LISS III data. The spatial extent of burnt area found to be highly varying and has been estimated as 7.95\xc2\xa0km2 in 1973, 17.19\xc2\xa0km2 in 1985, 5.51\xc2\xa0km2 in 1989, 9.55\xc2\xa0km2 in 1990, 4.55\xc2\xa0km2 in 1994, 6.89\xc2\xa0km2 in 1996 and 5.80\xc2\xa0km2 in 1999. Analysis of burnt area coverage for recent decade based on 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 reveals fire affected area as 8.10, 4.20, 12.21, 5.52, 3.19, 0.62, 1.81, 2.03, 3.00 and 1.36\xc2\xa0km2 area respectively. Spatial analysis indicates, an area of 47.51\xc2\xa0km2 (19.5\xc2\xa0% of total vegetation cover) affected by varying frequencies of fires from 1973 to 2014. High frequencies of fires have been observed in dry deciduous forests and grasslands. Buffer zone of national park has undergone frequent fires which may degrade climax forest vegetation and affects the regeneration and adaptability of indigenous species. Spatial tracking reveals 58.1\xc2\xa0% grid cells were affected by forest fires. Overall, there is a declining trend of forest fires indicates management effectiveness in Silent Valley National Park.'

Abstract: 'Understanding the chemical basis of rhizobacterial-plant interaction provides immense opportunities for the enhancement of agricultural productivity. In the current study, use of eighteen different rhizosphere samples from Western Ghats has resulted in the isolation of 92 rhizobacteria. All the isolates were screened for plant probiotic potential and found to have varying distribution of plant growth promoting characteristics. IAA production was quantitatively analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) for eight selected isolates with multiple plant beneficial traits. This has resulted in the identification of maximum IAA production (1724.23\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g/mL) by Providencia stuartii. In vivo confirmation of plant growth enhancement effect of selected isolates was carried out using the seedlings of Vigna radiata and Phaseolus vulgaris. The isolates were further analysed for their effect on quantitative enhancement of saponin contents in the medicinal plant Bacopa monnieri. Statistical analysis of the results of the study showed excellent growth promoting and secondary metabolite enhancement effects of selected organisms. The study highlights immense applications of selected isolates in organic farming practices.'

Abstract: 'Spatial and temporal trends of invasion by Ochlandra travancorica, a native reed bamboo species were studied. The study was carried out in Agasthyamalai Biosphere reserve, Western Ghats, India. Multi-temporal satellite images from 1973 to 2012 were utilized to map the areas of occurrence of the species. The largest areal extent of the species was calculated to be 111.65\xc2\xa0km2 in the recent time, at which the invasion process reached its saturation phase. The species was found to be a generalist, with no preferred inclination towards any particular topographic or climatic zone. Evergreen forests were established to be its closest associate with largest area followed by semi evergreen and moist deciduous forests within buffer distances of 100, 200 and 500\xc2\xa0m. A threatening 20.8\xc2\xa0% of evergreen forests were revealed to have been converted to pure reed bamboos. Overlay analysis showed the oldest and the newest surviving patches of pure reed bamboos in the landscape of Agasthyamalai. The study realizes the significance of remote sensing and GIS in mapping and monitoring of invasive species. We suggest periodical monitoring of reed bamboo areas to check its growth, spread and establishment in order to ensure conservation of Western Ghats.'

Abstract: 'The aim of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in soils of the southern region of the Western Ghats, a \xe2\x80\x98biodiversity hotspot\xe2\x80\x99, and thereby futher our understanding of the microbial communities in this ecological niche. The diversity and phylogeny of bacterial populations in soil samples collected from various locations of the Tamil Nadu and Kerala regions of Western Ghats were compared using both cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent methods. A total of 171 bacterial strains were isolated based on their morphological characteristics and their diversity indices calculated. The distinctive amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) pattern of each isolate was determined, and representative isolates were then subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. On the basis of their sequence similarity, the isolates were distributed among three different genera belonging to Firmicutes (83.3\xc2\xa0%), Proteobacteria (8.3\xc2\xa0%) and high G+C Gram-positive bacteria (8.3\xc2\xa0%). The highest and the lowest values for the diversity indices were obtained for metagenomic DNA extracted from isolates BWGA and BVP, respectively; these were used for 16S rRNA gene library construction and analysis. Based on their phylogenetic analysis, the predominant members of the habitat were found to belong to the phylum Firmicutes (84.62\xc2\xa0%). Firmicutes was the dominant bacterial phylum detected by both approaches, but the culture-independent approach detected a considerably higher number of uncultivable bacteria. In conclusion, in our study of the bacterial diversity of this Western Ghats region, we fund that the genus Bacillus was predominant among the samples assessed by both cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent methods.'

Abstract: 'Assessing the distribution, abundance and demographic ratios of endangered and elusive co-occurring carnivore species at a landscape level is important for their continued survival. Despite potential to determine distribution and dietary analyses, use of faecal samples has been relatively limited in the context of multiple sympatric species living at large landscapes. We developed and optimized a range of novel non-invasive molecular techniques for species, gender and individual identification of tiger (Panthera tigris) and leopard (Panthera pardus). We collected a large number of faecal samples as part of a pilot occupancy survey in the Malenad-Mysore Tiger Landscape, Western Ghats, India. We could genetically ascertain species and gender for 88 and 57\xc2\xa0% of the field-collected samples respectively. Additionally, we also determined a panel of nine and eight polymorphic loci for tiger and leopard individual identification, resulting in 18 tigers and 39 leopards from varied quality field-collected samples. Our pilot study suggest such molecular approaches will help in future efforts to gather landscape level distribution, demographic and other ecological information on tigers and leopards across their distribution.'

Abstract: 'Phenological studies help to analyze resource abundance and feeding ecology of some herbivorous primate species. The rainforest between the rivers Aghnashini and Sharavathy in Karnataka, India, is one of the richest primate habitats in the country. Plant resource availability was studied in this forest using belt transect and plot methods. More than 800 trees of 71 species were considered for phenology sampling, and the tree species used by primates for consumption of leaves, flowers and fruits were selected for availability monitoring. Flush leaves were available throughout the year. The availability of mature leaves and flowers was highest in pre-summer (December\xe2\x80\x93February). Unripe and ripe fruits were mostly available in summer (March\xe2\x80\x93May). The availability of these resources showed significant seasonal variation. The availability and abundance of plant food resources throughout the year, presence of keystone species and broad food niches probably account for the presence of a high density of primates including 32, 47 and 151 groups of lion-tailed macaques, bonnet macaques and Hanuman langurs respectively in about 200\xc2\xa0km2 of this forest making this region a model for primate conservation.'

Abstract: 'Four accessions of the lesser-known legume, Cassia obtusifolia L. (Sickle pod), collected from four different agroclimatic regions of Western Ghats, were evaluated for agrobotanical traits and chemical composition. Amongthe four accessions, the Keriparai accession had the highest values for plant height (cm), number of flowers per cluster, number of pods per cluster, pod length (cm), seeds per pod, seed weight (g) per pod and seed recovery percentage. Crude protein ranged from 18.56\xe2\x80\x9322.93%, crude lipid was between 5.35\xe2\x80\x937.40%, crude fiber ranged from 6.83\xe2\x80\x939.45%, ash content ranged from 5.14\xe2\x80\x935.83% and carbohydrate varied from 57.00\xe2\x80\x9360.69%. Globulins constituted the bulk of the seed protein as in most legumes. Mineral profiles, viz., sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, iron, copper, zinc and manganese ranged from 42.92\xe2\x80\x9384.83, 758.05\xe2\x80\x931555.79, 559.92\xe2\x80\x93791.72, 456.36\xe2\x80\x93709.47, 629.13\xe2\x80\x93947.79, 8.42\xe2\x80\x9312.35, 0.93\xe2\x80\x932.06, 10.60\xe2\x80\x9330.04 and 2.12\xe2\x80\x934.12 Mg/100 g seeds flour, respectively. Seed proteins of all accessions exhibited relatively high levels of non-essential and essential amino acids, with the exception of threonine. The in vitro protein digestibility of the legume ranged from 74.66 to 81.44%. Antinutritional substances such as total free phenolics ranged from 0.34\xe2\x80\x930.66%; tannins were between 0.47\xe2\x80\x930.60%, L-DOPA content ranged from 0.98\xe2\x80\x931.34%; trypsin inhibitor activity varied from 11.4\xe2\x80\x9313.5 TIU/mg protein and chymotrypsin inhibitor activity ranged from 10.8\xe2\x80\x9312.3 CIU/mg protein. Phytohemagglutinating activity also was assayed. Inconclusion, the accessions of C. obtusifolia, collected from Western Ghats, South India, could serve as a low-cost source of some important nutrients for humans. The antinutritional factors might have little nutritional significance, if the seeds are processed properly.'

Abstract: 'This article presents the tendency of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the dependence of vegetation on the rainfall and number of rainy and non-rainy days over Western Ghats. The study makes use of MODIS Terra NDVI data with 8-day intervals and 250-m resolution from 2000 to 2010 during the southwest monsoon (June to September) season. The results show an increasing tendency of the NDVI over different test sites in Western Ghats. The relation of the NDVI with the Antecedent Precipitation Index obtained from rainfall showed good agreement, and the relation of rainfall and the NDVI was mainly dependent on the available soil moisture levels and elevations of the test sites. Correlations were significant and positive with the number of rainy days and negative with the number of non-rainy days with a nearly 2-month lag.'

Abstract: 'Endophytic fungi associated with leaf and stem samples of Humboldtia brunonis Wall, a dominant myrmecophyte, commonly known as \xe2\x80\x98hasige mara\xe2\x80\x99, endemic to the South Western Ghats of India were enumerated from two sites viz. Charmadi and Mangalore University arboretum and tested for antimicrobial activity. Aspergillus sp., Curvularia clavata, Curvularia pallescens, Debaromyces hansenii, Guignardia sp., Hypoxylon anthochroum, Meyerozyma caribbica, Paecilomyces lilacinus were found in leaf samples of H. brunonis. Alternaria alternata, Cunninghamella echinulata, Fusarium fusarioides, Fusarium oxysporum, Phanerochaete sp. were found in stem samples. Lasiodiplodia theobromae was commonly present in both the samples. The zone of inhibition by the endophytic fungi Curvularia pallescens isolated from H. brunonis for Candida albicans was up to 24\xc2\xa0mm diameter, which is comparable to the inhibition by the antifungal standard Nystatin (24\xc2\xa0mm). In seven endophytic fungi possessed free radical scavenging activity at 10\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml, the highest being in C. pallescens extracts. In the present study, C. pallescens exhibited better antimicrobial and antioxidant activity compared to the other extracts. The presence of mycotoxin curvularin was reported in the partially purified fraction of C. pallescens.'

Abstract: 'We assessed the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and dark septate endophyte (DSE) fungal associations in 57 ferns and 3 lycophytes (belonging to 15 families in 39 genera) of different life forms (epiphytic, saxicolous and terricolous) occurring in Palni Hills of Western Ghats. Fungal symbiosis was absent in all the three lycophytes examined. Fifty-five of the 57 ferns (91.66\xc2\xa0%) examined had AM and 37 (64.91\xc2\xa0%) had DSE fungal association. This is the first report on AM and DSE fungal association for 22 and 30 species, respectively. In addition, AM morphology was evaluated for the first time in 34 species. Sixty-five percentage of the mycorrhizal ferns had intermediate-type AM and 19.30\xc2\xa0% had typical Paris-type AM morphology. Both Paris- and intermediate-type AM morphologies were observed in 10.53\xc2\xa0% of ferns. The root length colonized by AM and DSE fungal structures significantly varied among species, and a significant negative relation existed between the root length colonized by AM and DSE fungi.'

Abstract: 'Studies on the effects of tropical rainforest fragmentation and disturbance have often focussed on plants and vertebrates such as birds and mammals and seldom on invertebrates, despite the latter being among the most biologically diverse groups in these ecosystems. Spiders are one such group of invertebrate predators that are known to be sensitive indicators of environmental change in tropical ecosystems. The present study assesses the spider community structure and responses to rainforest fragmentation and degradation and conversion to shade-coffee plantations in the Anamalai hills, southern Western Ghats, India. Ten rainforest fragments ranging in size from 11\xc2\xa0ha to 2,600\xc2\xa0ha under varying levels of degradation within the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary and private lands of the Valparai plateau, and two shade-coffee plantation sites were sampled for spiders using visual searches along time-constrained belt transects between January and May 2005. Within a total sampled area of 5.76\xc2\xa0ha, 4,565 individual spiders (4,300 detections) belonging to 156 morphospecies within 21 families and 8 functional groups were recorded. The estimated total number of understorey spider species in the study area was 192 (\xc2\xb15.15\xc2\xa0SD) species, representing around 13% of the total number of spider species so far described from India. Overall spider density, species richness, and species density showed no trend in relation to fragment area across all sites. Specific comparisons among undisturbed sites indicated however that high altitude sites had fewer species than mid-altitude sites and fragments had fewer species than relatively larger continuous forest sites. In contrast to the lack of trend in overall species richness and abundance, species composition changed substantially in relation to habitat alteration and altitude. Cluster analysis of Bray-Curtis similarities among sites in spider species composition revealed four distinct clusters: high altitude undisturbed sites, mid-altitude disturbed sites with an undisturbed mid altitude site, mid-altitude highly disturbed sites with a disturbed site, and shade-coffee plantation sites. Spider species, such as Psechrus torvus and Tylorida culta, that contributed significantly to the dissimilarity between undisturbed and disturbed rainforest sites, and rainforest and shade-coffee sites were identified that serve as useful indicators of habitat alteration.'

Abstract: 'Agroforestry plays an important role in food security, sustainable development and biodiversity conservation. For understanding the role of agroforestry on biodiversity, a study was undertaken to access butterfly diversity in coffee, cashew and guava plantations in Eastern Ghats of southern Odisha during February\xe2\x80\x93April 2016. A total of 1075 individuals of butterflies belonging to 60 species and 46 genera under five families were recorded during the study. Species richness (S) as well as Shannon diversity (H) were found to be higher in coffee (S\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8945, H\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x893.051) plantation, followed by cashew (S\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8931, H\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892.807) and guava (S\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8920, H\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892.519). However, though butterfly abundance was found to be maximum in coffee (43%), it was higher in guava (33%) followed by cashew (24%). Also, a significant difference was observed between butterfly abundance among three plantations. This shows coffee plantation was the best habitat for butterflies among the three agroforestry habitats studied. The reason for this was habitat heterogeneity in coffee plantation supporting maximum exclusive butterfly species and was least-human influenced with close canopy forest. Over all, family Nymphalidae was found to be the most abundant, and Lycaenidae was the least abundant. The findings of the present study are promising and may set new directions for management of agroforestry plantations in the region to support a rich biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Floral composition and structural parameters of the herbaceous vegetation of four recovering tropical dry deciduous forest stands protected for 2, 4, 6 and 10-year periods, on the Eastern Ghats of India, situated at Kandhamal district of Orissa, India were investigated. More than 1\xc2\xa0ha of recovering forest stands of each of the four stages was selected and fifteen sample quadrats of 1\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa01\xc2\xa0m were randomly placed at each stand for vegetation analysis. Floristic analysis revealed highest number of species (69) in 2-year recovering stand, which declined with increase in age. A total of 87 species, 71 genera and 32 families were recorded in the forest stands. Total number of herbaceous species encountered in the stands was 44, 28, 30 and 24 in 2, 4, 6 and 10-year stands, respectively. Total individuals of all herb species were 114, 70, 88 and 68\xc2\xa0plant\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 in 2, 4, 6 and 10-year stands, respectively. Herbaceous stand basal areas were 7.84, 3.66, 4.77 and 5.23\xc2\xa0cm2\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 in 2, 4, 6, and 10-year stands, respectively. Importance value index (IVI) revealed that Heteropogon contortus was predominant in 2 and 4-year stands, Andrographis paniculatus in 6-year stand and Elephantopus scaber in 10-year stand. Diversity-dominance curve revealed lognormal distribution in all the four stands. Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s dominance index (C) was highest in 2-year stand which decreased in other stands, while Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s diversity index (H1) was almost the same in all the stands. Biomass of herbaceous vegetation was 83.2\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 in 2\xc2\xa0year, 62.2\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 in 4\xc2\xa0year, 58.0\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 in 6\xc2\xa0year and 64.0\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 in 10-year stand.'

Abstract: '\nCanopy gaps play a significant role in maintaining structure and composition of tropical forests. This study was carried out in tropical evergreen forests of central Western Ghats in India to understand the influence of canopy gap size and the relationship of gap regime attributes to diversity measures and regeneration. The average gap size in the study area was found to be 396\xc2\xa0m2 and around half of gaps were 4\xe2\x80\x938\xc2\xa0years old. Gaps created by natural single tree fall were smaller in size but significantly higher in number. Diversity and regeneration of woody species were compared with canopy gaps and intact vegetation. Species richness and diversity was higher in gaps than in intact vegetation. Macaranga peltata, a shade intolerant species dominated gaps while intact vegetation was dominated by shade tolerant Kingiodendron pinnatum. Gap size significantly influenced species diversity and regeneration. Gap area and age were significantly and negatively correlated with diversity measures but positively correlated with regeneration. Among all the attributes of gaps, regeneration was significantly positively correlated with light intensity. Gaps maintained species diversity and favored regeneration of woody species. In addition to gap size and age, other gap ecological attributes also affected species diversity and regeneration.'

Abstract: 'In this study, the effects of changes in historical and projected land use land cover (LULC) on monthly streamflow and sediment yield for the Netravati river basin in the Western Ghats of India are explored using land use maps from six time periods (1972, 1979, 1991, 2000, 2012, and 2030) and the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). The LULC for 2030 is projected using the land change modeller with the assumption of normal growth. The sensitivity analysis, model calibration, and validation indicated that the SWAT model could reasonably simulate streamflow and sediment yield in the river basin. The results showed that the spatial extent of the LULC classes of urban (1.80\xe2\x80\x939.96%), agriculture (31.38\xe2\x80\x9355.75%), and water bodies (1.48\xe2\x80\x932.66%) increased, whereas that of forest (53.04\xe2\x80\x9327.03%), grassland (11.17\xe2\x80\x934.41%), and bare land (1.09\xe2\x80\x930.16%) decreased from 1972 to 2030. The streamflow increased steadily (7.88%) with changes in LULC, whereas the average annual sediment yield decreased (0.028%) between 1972 and 1991 and increased later (0.029%) until 2012. However, it may increase by 0.43% from 2012 to 2030. The results indicate that LULC changes in urbanization and agricultural intensification have contributed to the increase in runoff, amounting to 428.65 and 58.67\xc2\xa0mm, respectively, and sediment yield, amounting to 348 and 43\xc2\xa0ton/km2, respectively, in the catchment area from 1972 to 2030. The proposed methodology can be applied to other river basins for which temporal digital LULC maps are available for better water resource management plans.'

Abstract: 'Landscape ecology, inter alia, addresses the question as to how altered landscape patterns affect the distribution, persistence, and abundance of a species. Landscape ecology plays an important role in integrating the different scales of biodiversity from habitat patch to biome level. Satellite remote sensing technology with multi-sensor capabilities offers multi-scale information on landscape composition and configuration. Advances in geospatial analytical tools and spatial statistics have improved the capability to quantify spatial heterogeneity. Globally, landscape level characterization of biodiversity has become an important discipline of science. Considering the vast extent, heterogeneity, and ecological and economic importance of forest landscapes, significant efforts have been made in India during the past decade to strengthen landscape level biodiversity characterization. The generic frame work of studies comprises preparation of national databases providing information on composition and configuration of different landscapes using multi-scale remote sensing techniques, understanding the landscape patterns using geospatial models to elicit disturbance and diversity patterns and application of this information for bioprospecting and conservation purposes. Studies on hierarchical linkage of multi-scale information to study the processes of change, landscape function, dynamics of habitat fragmentation, invasion, development of network of conservation areas based on the understanding of multi-species responses to landscape mosaics, macro-ecological studies to understand environment and species richness, habitat and species transitions and losses, landscape level solutions to adaptation and mitigation strategies to climate change are a few of the future challenges. The paper presents the current experiences and, analyses in conjunction with international scenario and identifies future challenges of Indian landscape level biodiversity studies.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests, which play critical roles in global biogeochemical cycles, radiation budgets and biodiversity, have undergone rapid changes in land cover in the last few decades. This study examines the complex process of land cover change in the biodiversity hotspot of Western Ghats, India, specifically investigating the effects of conservation measures within the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary. Current vegetation patterns were mapped using an IRS P6 LISS III image and this was used together with Landsat MSS data from 1973 to map land cover transitions. Two major and divergent trends were observed. A dominant degradational trend can be attributed to agricultural expansion and infrastructure development while a successional trend, resulting from protection of the area, showed the resilience of the system after prolonged disturbances. The sanctuary appears susceptible to continuing disturbances under the current management regime but at lower rates than in surrounding unprotected areas. The study demonstrates that remotely sensed land cover assessments can have important contributions to monitoring land management strategies, understanding processes underpinning land use changes and helping to inform future conservation strategies.'

Abstract: 'Understanding the patterns of biodiversity is central to species conservation planning. Here we illustrate chiropteran diversity and distribution pattern of the hill ranges of the Eastern Ghats of Odisha state, India using roost survey and mist net survey techniques. The present study recorded 23 bat species including two newly recorded species for the study site i.e., Hipposideros galeritus and Megaderma spasma. The bat capture rate was the highest in the moist deciduous forest describing higher bat populations compared with the places of human habitation. Utilities of 21 climate, three physiographic and two disturbance variables and species distribution modelling could reveal that the north-eastern part was more suitable for bat distributions than the southern part of the region. The climate, physiographic and disturbance variables were crucial in their distributions, where elevation and potential evapotranspiration were highly significant. Unlike other species, Taphozous melanopogon showed negative correlation with these variables. The mean diurnal temperature and precipitation seasonality have positive influence on bat distributions, indicating their resilience to seasonal precipitation changes and day time temperature fluctuations. The negative effect of temperature seasonality on the distribution of Pteropus giganteus could attribute to its vulnerability to climate change effects. The study provides inputs for monitoring the future spatio-temporal changes, suggesting long term conservation measures. It could generate basic information on the impacts of climate change on bat distribution in the future climate change scenario.'

Abstract: 'In tropical evergreen forest in the Kolli Hills of the Indian Eastern Ghats, four 2 ha (100 m \xc3\x97 200 m) replicate plots (two plots each in undisturbed and human-impacted sites), were inventoried for species diversity of lianas \xe2\x89\xa55 cm girth at breast height (g.b.h.) and their relationships with \xe2\x89\xa530 cm g.b.h. host trees. Liana diversity included 26 species from 18 families and 24 genera. The population density and basal area of lianas in the study plots were 48 individuals ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 0.23 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively, while those of the trees were 478 stems ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 43.6 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. As the lianas and their hosts had often been cut in the disturbed sites, their diversity was less there than in the undisturbed sites. Five (19%) liana species were common to all four sites. Three lianas, Hiptage benghalensis (Malpighiaceae), Elaeagnus indica (Elaeagnaceae) and Gnetum ula (Gnetaceae) were dominant. The twining mechanism (54% of liana species and 71% of individuals) and zoochorous diaspores (73% of species and 77% of individuals) predominated. A total of 336 trees from 39 species, 34 genera and 22 families hosted 345 lianas. The ratio of liana : host for species was 1 : 1.5 and for individuals was 1 : 1. Liana preferences for certain host trees, host girth classes and trellis heights were evident.'

Abstract: 'Director of environmental studies at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Human Ecology, Environmental and Population Studies at the University of Rajasthan. This paper describes the biodiversity in the north-western Indian State of Rajasthan, its relationship with the environment and the existing human and livestock populations. As the biodiversity is depleting in this area due to zoogenic and anthropogenic reasons, certain pragmatic conservation strategies are advocated. The north-western part of India is occupied by a desert ecosystem, the Thar Desert. Animal husbandry is the major livelihood in the region, followed by agriculture. The vegetation, which is predominantly xerophytic and quite sparse, occurs in great variety. Six hundred and eighty-two plant species and 390 animal species have been identified from the Thar Desert. Many plant and animal species have become endangered due to zoogenic and anthropogenic activities. Plants such as Calligonum polygonoides, Tecomella undulata and Prosopis cineraria urgently require conservation.'

Title: 'Assessing the utility of direct and indirect methods for estimating tropical tree age in the Western Ghats, India'

Abstract: 'The knowledge of tree age is important for understanding tree growth and forest dynamics. It may be estimated by \xe2\x80\x98direct\xe2\x80\x99 methods involving growth ring counts, or by \xe2\x80\x98indirect\xe2\x80\x99 methods involving field measurements of growth rates. Direct methods are considered more accurate, but it is not clear if they are appropriate for all species, notably from the humid tropics. In this paper we assess the occurrence of annual growth rings and their utility for age estimation in three tropical tree species, Acrocarpus fraxinifolius, Dalbergia latifolia (Fabaceae) and Syzygium cumini (Myrtaceae), growing in traditional shade coffee plantations of the southern Western Ghats, India. These species previously were described as having \xe2\x80\x9cindistinct or absent\xe2\x80\x9d growth rings. We used anatomical studies, field measurements and computational methods to characterise growth rings and assess similarities between directly and indirectly estimated tree ages. Our study revealed that annual growth rings were characterised by different sets of anatomical features per species and were most distinct in the fast-growing deciduous A. fraxinifolius. Growth rates measured in the field showed annual periodicity in all three species, and reflected annual rainfall-drought cycles in D. latifolia and S. cumini. Direct age estimates were most similar to indirect estimates in D. latifolia, and least so in S. cumini. The results of direct age estimation by counting rings are consistent with them being annual in nature in tropical species with distinct and reliable annual growth ring formation. However, for species with poorly defined growth rings, indirect age estimation methods might be more useful.'

Abstract: 'This paper examines the status and characteristics of agrobiodiversity present in Kerala State, India, which is a part of the Western Ghats\xe2\x80\x94Sri Lanka biodiversity hotspot. They show much heterogeneity. The State grows 142 crop plants belonging to 104 genera and 43 families. Almost the entire agrobiodiversity conservation work is being carried out by the central government, even though the states are also mandated to do this work. This appears to have an adverse effect on agrobiodiversity conservation. Until now, most attention was being paid to only the most important food and commercial crops, and very limited to their wild relatives and the less important crop plants.'

Abstract: 'This article compares a range of initiatives aimed at involving people in the management of forest resources in Nepal and India. In Nepal, we focus on three categories of state-initiated programs: community forestry, the parks\xe2\x80\x99 buffer zone program, and leasehold forestry. In the southern Indian state of Karnataka, we study the state-initiated Joint Forest Planning and Management program along with older institutions of leaf manure forests (Soppina betta) and historical sacred forests (Kans). We conclude that state-initiated approaches to involving communities have been limited, at best, promote standardized and relatively inflexible management practices, and lead to partial improvement in biodiversity and people\xe2\x80\x99s livelihoods. When management is initiated and owned by the community, as in the case of sacred groves in India, and when other conditions are appropriate, communities can have the opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for putting effective and adaptive conservation practices in place.'

Abstract: 'At present the biodiversity in Eastern Ghats is threatened by loss of habitats, exploitation and unscientific management of natural resources, forest fire, biological invasion and other anthropogenic pressures. In this context, we have assessed the forest cover changes, fragmentation and disturbance in the R.V. Nagar Range of Eastern Ghats region, Andhra Pradesh using satellite remote sensing and GIS techniques. Satellite data of IRS-1A LISS II of 1988 and IRS-P6 LISS III of 2006 were assessed for forest cover changes in 1 sq.km grid and generated as Sensitivity Index map. Further the road and settlement buffer of 1000\xc2\xa0m was generated to represent Threat Index map. From 1988 to 2006, the forest cover had a total cover loss of 35.2 sq.km and increase in scrub cover by 7.2%. Over all change analysis from 1988 to 2006 with reference to forest cover indicates, negative changes (loss of forest area) accounted for 48.1 sq.km area and positive changes (gain of forest) for an area of 12.1 sq.km of area. The results of the change detection using multi-date satellite imagery suggest degradation in forest cover over two decades, which necessitates the conservation measures in this range with high priority.'

Abstract: 'Live fencing, an age old and traditional agroforestry practice, remains relatively less understood and least documented at least in India. Exploratory surveys conducted in the northern part of the Eastern ghat region of India covering five districts of three states (Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Chhatisgarh), indicated that traditional farmers have vast knowledge about their live fencing practices and the species used. Two groups of species were observed on the fence. The first group of thirty three species were used primarily for protection and denoted as fence species. Together, they also provide 22 other products and services. The second group of species maintained on the fences for production purposes include five fruit trees, fifteen other trees and two climbers. The fencing practices were classified into two groups (single species and multiple species live fence systems) depending on the species used and into three groups (live fencing around field crops, around backyards or homesteads and around orchards/plantations) depending on the landscapes being protected. Only 20% of fences were dominated by single species; the rest were under multiple species.Ninety percent of house backyards were fenced, whereas only one percent of crop fields and seventy percent orchards were fenced. Some promising fence species of this region are Acacia caesia, A concinna, A. nilotica, Agave sisalana, Annona squamosa, Borassus flabellifer, Carissa carandus, Lawsonia inermis and Murraya koenigii'

Abstract: 'The present study describes the exploitation of microbial biodiversity from Western Ghats of Kerala for screening of bioactives having \xce\xb2-lactamase inhibitory activities. A total of 700 pure cultures were isolated and were screened for antibacterial activity against a \xce\xb2-lactam resistant Bacillus cereus strain (PL 10) isolated from the same niche. Bioactive extracts made from 45 isolates showed inhibitory activities against PL 10, of which two strains showed inhibition of extended spectrum \xce\xb2-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella ESBL1101 and three strains inhibited methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain MRSA831. All these five strains showed wide spectrum antimicrobial activity against various fungi and bacteria. These five cultures were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing and biochemical tests and the preliminary characterizations of their bioactive extracts were carried out. This study suggests the potential of bioactives from two inhibitor\xe2\x80\x93producer strains, NII 167 and NII 1054, for being developed as inhibitors against wide spectrum \xce\xb2-lactam resistant strains.'

Abstract: 'The primary deciduous forests in the Eastern Ghats (EG) of Tamil Nadu (TN) India have undergone many changes owing to various need-based forest managements, such as timber extraction for industry, railway sleepers, charcoal, and forest clearance for hydroelectric projects and agriculture, during preindependence and postindependence periods (i.e., from 1800 to 1980). The enactment of a forest conservation act during the 1980s changed the perception of forest managers from utilization to conservation. This study was taken up to assess the forests dynamics in the EG of TN spatially between 1990 and 2003 and nonspatially between 1900 and the 1980s. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Indian Remote Sensing satellite (IRS) 1D Linear Imaging and Self Scanning (LISS III) data were used to assess forests during 1990 and 2003, respectively. Field floristic survey and secondary data (such as published literature, floras, books, and forest working plans) were used to assess the forest dynamics in terms of forest type and species composition among the preindependence period, the postindependence period, and the present (i.e., before and after 1980). The satellite data analysis revealed a considerable amount of changes in all forest types during the 13\xc2\xa0years. The comparison of species composition and forest types between the past and present revealed that need-based forest management along with anthropogenic activity have altered the primary deciduous forest in to secondary and postextraction secondary forests such as southern thorn and southern thorn scrub forests in the middle [400\xe2\x80\x93900\xc2\xa0m above mean sea level (MSL)] and lower slopes (<400\xc2\xa0m MSL). However, the evergreen forests present at the upper slope (>900\xc2\xa0m MSL) and plateau seemed not to be much affected by the forest management. The changes estimated by the satellite data processing in the major forest types such as evergreen, deciduous, southern thorn, and southern thorn scrub are really alarming because these changes have occurred after the implementation of a forest conservation act. The dependence of local people on forests for various purposes in this region is also considerably high, which might be a key factor for the changes in the forests. The results of this study not only provide an outlook on the present status of the forests and the change trends but also provide the basis for further studies on forests in the EG of TN.'

Abstract: 'In order to ensure that threatened species are included in the conservation of our biological diversity, it is necessary to prioritise species and thus by landscape or implement measure for prioritised area. This requires geographical data specifying the places where threatened plants grow and the qualitative descriptions of environmental variables with which they are associated. The fundamental niche can be viewed as the set of environmental conditions and resources that allow a given species to survive and reproduce in the absence of biotic interactions. To survive and avoid competition for the same resources, a species usually occupies only a part of its fundamental niche in a particular community or ecosystem \xe2\x80\x94 that is its realized niche. Currently available floras, which provide valuable information about the species distribution pattern, do not indicate specific locations or the qualitative descriptions of environmental variables with which they are associated. In the present study realized niches of the threatened plant species of Peppara Wildlife Sanctuary were gathered using Global Positioning System (GPS) and distribution and abundance of each species were measured by stratified random sampling techniques. The realized niches of each threatened species were gathered by GPS and inductive habitat suitability assessment modelling has been done in Geographic Information System (GIS) along with environmental, edaphic, topographic and phytosociological data for their fundamental niche. The study resulted in documenting 151 tree species belonging to 51 families with eight threatened species. The distribution of each threatened species, their realized niches and its status, ecological amplitude among forest types and their geographical positions in the landscape were documented and mapped. This will lead to the exact locality information of the concerned taxa, their population status, edaphic and climatic characters of their habitat, their niche width, potential localities to be searched, knowledge of their habitat requirements; particularly the factors limiting their distributions, the factors leading to local and biological extinction and critical habitats.'

Abstract: 'Globally, as on today, only about two million species have been identified, while the actual number of species is estimated to be between 10 and 30 million. This enormous treasured biodiversity is an essential provider of ecosystem goods and services to the mankind. Aquatic germplasm resources of India comprise whole lot of organisms, both animals and plants origin, it is mainly the finfish and shellfish species which have actual and potential value for both capture fisheries and aquaculture. These aquatic resources possess enormous potential to contribute towards the economic well-being of the nation, besides contributing to genetic improvement of farmed aquatic species. However, in spite of the important role that the biodiversity plays in our lives, all species that together comprise biodiversity have been facing huge risks, especially due to a number of anthropogenic factors. In the present paper an attempt has been made to review the approaches, modern genetic tools and modus operandi which are relevant to the management of the resources and to outline the future opportunities in research efforts for sustainable fish production to address the food concerns of the country.'

Abstract: 'Environmental implications of Biological spectrum vis-\xc3\xa0-vis tree species diversity in two protected forests of Gandhamardan hill ranges of Eastern Ghats, India, are of great ecological significance in the perspective of climatic change. Biological spectrum includes phanerophytes (38.4\xc2\xa0%), nanophanerophytes (11.4\xc2\xa0%), chamaephytes (5.5\xc2\xa0%), hemicryptophytes (2.4\xc2\xa0%), geophytes (4.1\xc2\xa0%), hydrophytes (0.7\xc2\xa0%), therophytes (27.3\xc2\xa0%), and lianas (10\xc2\xa0%). The comparison with Raunkiaer\xe2\x80\x99s normal spectrum depicts \xe2\x80\x9cPhanero-Therophytic Phytoclimate\xe2\x80\x9d. The present study enlisted of a total of 10,775 trees belonging to 90 tree species within a 17.6\xc2\xa0ha sampled area (441 plots). The Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Weiner index (H\xe2\x80\xb2) is 3.92 (Site-I) and 3.31 (Site-II) with Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s value 1.0. This value indicates that the tropical moist deciduous forests are also species diverse systems. Mean stand density was 671\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in Site-I and 565\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in Site-II. Ascertaining the phytoclimate of Gandhamardan hill ranges vis-\xc3\xa0-vis tree species diversity and comparing the area on a geographical scale would be helpful for conservation and management of the study area.'

Abstract: 'Vegetation structure and species composition of tropical ecosystems were studied through nine transects at Veerapuli and Kalamalai reserve forests in the Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India. Species diversity, dominance, species richness and evenness indices of plant communities and also population structure of woody plants were enumerated. A total of 244 species (183 genera and 76 families) were recorded. Species richness (number of species) were 82,142 and 96 species per 0.3 ha respectively for the study areas of low-elevation forest (LEF), mid-elevation forest (MEF) and high elevation forest (HEF). Species diversity indices were greater in MEF compared to the other two forests except juveniles. In contrast, greater dominance value indices were recorded in LEF than other forests. Density and basal area of the MEF were twice greater than the LEF, while HEF showed greater tree density and low basal area when compared to LEF. The stem density and species richness (number of species) decreased with increased size classes of trees observed in the present study indicated good regeneration status. Population structure of juveniles and seedlings also reflects good regeneration status. Terminalia paniculata (IVI of 99.9) and Hopea parviflora (IVI of 103.8) were dominant tree species respectively in LEF and MEF whereas in HEF Agrostistachys meeboldii (63.65), Cullenia excelsa (63.67) and Drypetes oblongifolia (39.67) share the dominance. Past damage (anthropogenic perturbation) may be one of the reasons for single species dominance in LEF and MEF. Occurrence of alien species such as Eupatorium odoratum and Ageratum conyzoides also indicated the past disturbance in LEF. The variations in plant diversity and population structure are largely due to anthropogenic perturbation and other abiotic factors.'

Abstract: 'Desertification is a global land degradation problem faced both in the developed and developing countries alike. Kolli hill is one of the hills of the Eastern Ghats of India, currently undergoing conspicuous land degradation to such an extent, that it has already begun to witness an altered forest stand. Hence, the main goal of this study is to identify areas under actual and potential desertification risk by means of a modelling approach in which four indicator thematic layers (soil, climate, vegetation and anthropic pressure buffers) were overlaid in GIS environment. The cartographic data were transformed to structured numerical data (weighted layers) such that each of the layers was assigned knowledge based weightage values in relation to their influence and contribution to the process of desertification to get the final desertification risk state of the forest region. Climate models suited for the Indian condition were utilized to determine the areas under potential risk of desertification and three Representative Concentration Pathways were employed to study the pattern of desertification by the middle and the end of this century. The results of the study show the present scenario with an area of 200\xc2\xa0km2 falling in the medium risk state and an area of 7\xc2\xa0km2 falling in the high-risk state. On average, about 215 and 214\xc2\xa0km2 of the forest area fall under the medium risk category, while an area of 9.5 and 8.94\xc2\xa0km2 belong to the high risk state for the years 2050 and 2070 respectively. The areas experiencing these risk states belong to the foothills and mid slopes of the forest region and fall within the semiarid\xe2\x80\x93dry sub-humid aridity zonation.'

Abstract: 'Corridors (variably called landscape linkages, connectors, and gateways) are expanses of a landscape that facilitate the flow or movement of individuals, genes, and ecological processes. Protected areas with their buffer zones and the corridors that connect them are cornerstones of modern conservation actions to maintain the biodiversity we have and restore what we have lost. Policy and governance to guide the establishment and management of protected areas and supporting buffer zones is well established in the Central Indian Highlands. A policy and governance structure to create the context and enabling conditions for corridor maintenance, creation, and recovery is emerging but is constrained by the reigning land-management paradigm that separates conservation from development rather than mainstreaming species and habitat conservation into the rural development agenda. Well-nourished, healthy human populations and healthy ecosystems are inextricably linked. The worsening ecological conditions in the Central Indian Highlands can trigger the emergence of a common agenda for an inclusive, caring, and environment-friendly mode of development. The alternative is the business-as-usual scenario: a continuation of worsening ecological conditions. Entry points through the biodiversity, agriculture production, resource extraction, and economic/social sectors to enable integrated sustainable landscape management are identified. These include deepening what it means to successfully conserve a species combined with explicit threat analysis for at-risk tigers and the landscapes that supports them; landscape scenario modeling to advance communication by synthesizing diverse forms of research and articulating and evaluating alternative socio-economic futures; and the use of the smart green infrastructure process as an approach to development rather than only as a way to mitigate environmental damage. Models are presented to scale up from isolated conservation interventions to collective impact that unites supportive government partners with individuals, NGOs, and economic interests to achieve viable long-term relationships in human and natural systems to value, maintain, and recover landscape connectivity.'

Abstract: 'An ecosystem approach is the only way to conserve habitats and the enormous number of species. The related area-based Aichi biodiversity target of the convention on biological diversity aims to conserve at least 17% of terrestrial environment by 2020. This is the first regional study to recognize a network of key habitats to achieve conservation goals. It is essential to have a spatial framework by creating the indicator using existing remote sensing-based data. In this work, conservation principles were integrated at the ecosystem level covering irreplaceability and vulnerability along with representativeness. Forest persistence, ecosystem rarity, forest intactness, landscape-level ecosystem, biomass carbon stocks, and biological richness were among the biological criteria used to analyze ecosystem irreplaceability. The proxies used for ecosystem vulnerability are high fragmentation, fire hotspots and proximity to disturbance factors. A unique value is assigned to each individual pixel in the prioritization map. Overall representation of habitat coverage in protected area network of South Asian countries indicates under-representation of several forest types with less than 17% coverage. The overlay of the priority areas proposes that there is a possibility of conserving many species with the notification of protected areas. This study demonstrates the conservation priorities by identifying key habitats based on multiple conservation principles.'

Abstract: "This paper aims to throw light on the mass extinction that is overtaking Earth's species. Using an analytic methodology developed for an earlier partial assessment, it focuses on a series of \xe2\x80\x98hot-spot\xe2\x80\x99 areas, these being areas that (a) feature exceptional concentrations of species with high levels of endemism, and (b) face exceptional threats of destruction. The paper identifies another eight such areas, four of them in tropical forests and four in Mediterranean-type zones. The analysis reveals that the four tropical-forest areas contain at least 2,835 endemic plant species in 18,700 km2, or 1.1 percent of Earth's plant species in 0.013 percent of Earth's land surface; and that the four Mediterranean-type areas contain 12,720 endemic plan: species in 435,700 km2, or 5.1 percent of Earth's plant species in 0.3 percent of the Earth's land surface. Taken together, these eight hot-spot areas contain 15,555 endemic plant species in 454,400 km2, or 6.2 percent of Earth's plant species in 0.3 percent of Earth's land surface. This is to be compared with the earlier hot-spots analysis of 10 tropical-forest areas, with 34,400 endemic plant species in 292,000 km2, or 13.8 percent of Earth's plant species in 0.2 percent of Earth's land surface."

Abstract: ' Symplocos laurina Wall., an important medicinal tree species, is one of the pioneering plants for establishment of shola forest ecosystem. We analyzed 208 accessions of S. laurina from 13 populations belonging to three ecoregions in India namely, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats and Northeast India, to comment on the genetic diversity and population structure of the species. Of the 100 inter simple sequence repeat primers screened, eight were selected based on their clear and reproducible polymorphic patterns. These eight ISSR primers produced on an average 1,014 bands from 208 accessions, of which 6.58\xc2\xa0% were rare bands, 55.96\xc2\xa0% were shared bands and 37.46\xc2\xa0% were similar bands. The primers, UBC835 and UBC880, amplified the highest number of polymorphic loci (16), while the primer UBC852 amplified the least number of amplicons (9). The values for total genetic diversity (H T) and the average heterozygosity (H S) were 0.3407 and 0.2263, respectively; while the coefficient of genetic differentiation (G ST) was 0.3358. Within-population variance was higher (68\xc2\xa0%) than among-population variance (17\xc2\xa0%), indicating high intra-population genetic diversity. These populations were grouped according to their geographical location in cluster analysis. Mantel test also showed significant positive correlation between genetic and geographical distances. The present study revealed the importance of the Palghat gap in South India in shaping the distribution of genetic diversity in S. laurina.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests are the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest terrestrial storehouses of carbon and are recognized as rich, diverse and highly productive ecosystems. The present study was conducted to characterize the land use, diversity and biomass of tropical forest in Western Ghat of Maharashtra State in India through satellite remote sensing and GIS. The study has been designed and implemented to promote analysis on Western Ghat biodiversity resources including trees, shrubs and herbs based on inventorying, monitoring and mapping. Field measured biomass is integrated with spectral responses of various bands and indices of the Landsat TM satellite image for estimation of above-ground biomass in a 36,046\xc2\xa0km2 area of relic forest in the Central Western Ghat. The above-ground biomass from field-based inventory varied from 30.2 to 151.1\xc2\xa0ton/ha in moist deciduous forest, 9.2\xe2\x80\x9399.1\xc2\xa0ton/ha in dry deciduous forest, 42.1\xe2\x80\x93158.6\xc2\xa0ton/ha in semi-evergreen forest, and 160.9\xe2\x80\x93271\xc2\xa0ton/ha in evergreen forest. The total above-ground biomass of the study area was estimated to be 95.2\xc2\xa0M tons. A regression equation between field above-ground biomass and a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was used for spectral modeling to estimate and prepare the above-ground biomass map in the region. A total 120 plant species in 81 genera and 31 families were identified in the study area. This study emphasizes the importance of relic forests for their biodiversity, carbon sequestration and total biomass.'

Abstract: 'Sacred groves are forest patches conserved by the local people intertwined with their socio-cultural and religious practice. These groves harbour rich biodiversity and play a significant role in the conservation of biodiversity. Population structure and regeneration status of woody species were studied during 2001\xe2\x80\x932002 in the four sacred groves of Manipur, a state in north east India. A total of 96 woody species was recorded from the four groves, the highest being Konthoujam Lairembi sacred grove (55 species) and lowest in Heingang Marjing sacred grove having 42 species. The density\xe2\x80\x93diameter distribution of woody species in the four groves showed highest stand density and species richness in the lowest girth class (30\xe2\x80\x9360\xc2\xa0cm) and decreased in the succeeding girth classes. Overall population structure of the groves based on the number of tree seedlings, saplings and adults, displayed a greater proportion of seedlings followed by saplings and adults while for the selected tree species it varied seasonally and recruitment of species increased during rainy season attaining peak during June. Regeneration status of the four sacred groves based on strength of different age groups in their population showed good regeneration. High occurrence of \xe2\x80\x98additional species\xe2\x80\x99 to the groves may be due to the invasion through dispersal from other areas. Possibly, the prevailing favourable microenvironmental conditions contributed to their establishment and growth in the groves. Absence of seedlings and saplings of some of the species in the groves may be due to their poor seed germination and establishment of seedlings in the forest.'

Abstract: 'This study focuses on the assessment of the status of world\xe2\x80\x99s remaining closed forests (WRCF), population distribution, and protected areas in global biodiversity hotspots using remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS). Conservation International (CI) has identified 25 eco-regions, called biodiversity hotspots that are especially rich in endemic species and are particularly threatened by human activities. This study uses globally consistent and comprehensive geo-spatial data sets generated using rerriote sensing and other sources, and the application of GIS layering methods. The consistent data set has made it possible to identify and quantify relationships between the WRCF, human population, and protected areas in biodiversity hotspots. It is expected that such information will provide a scientific basis for biodiversity hotspots management and assist in policy formulations at the national and international levels.'

Abstract: 'Molecular techniques are gaining importance in biodiversity conservation in India. They are especially beneficial in the case of rare species with cryptic habits that make them difficult study subjects when using conventional field techniques. Molecular tools can be used to decipher distributions and population connectedness in fragmented habitats and identify populations of immediate conservation concern. We discuss these with case studies on some cat species in India.'

Abstract: 'This study sought to reconstruct the history of Lantana invasion and spread in India by considering two questions; (a) from where, by who, and when were Lantana species introduced into India? and (b) given its long history in the country, is it still spreading or more or less stable? We critically evaluated the archival and historical information on plant imports by the European powers into India during the period before and after British colonization. We then reconstructed the path of spread by analyzing the spatio-temporal patterns of occurrence and distribution of Lantana in India at both the national and local scale using a GIS platform. The spread of Lantana across the globe started as early as the 1690s. The European colonial powers moved the plants from Latin America to Europe and to their colonial countries in the early 1800s. Lantana species were introduced in India from 1807 onwards and thereafter the colonial powers moved this plant across the country. Following its introduction into India, the spread of Lantana across the country, either through subsequent multiple introductions from Europe to different British cantonments, or through moving the plants between cantonments within India, were reasonably rapid spanning only a few decades. In the absence of a rigorous control program, the spread of Lantana has gone on unabated and thereby impacting both wildlife and biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation is recognized as one of the most significant components in LULCC and global changes scenario. It is imperative to assess its trend and the rate at which it is occurring. The changes will have long-lasting impact on regional climate and in turn on biodiversity. Present study was taken up in Kanakapura and surrounding areas located on the fringes of Western Ghats biodiversity hot-spots. Temporal satellite data from Landsat was classified into forest cover maps. Drivers of forest cover changes such as roads and settlements were used in order to create predicted map of the region using GEOMOD tool in Idrisi Andes. The predicted map was then validated using actual land cover map of same year prepared from Landsat data. The validated map was found to be 84.26 % accurate. The validation was also tested using ROC approach which was found to be 0.614. The model was then further extended to predict forest cover losses for year 2015. The results highlight ongoing deforestation in the areas adjoining Western Ghats. It also presents an application of the tool and the validation methods which can be used in predictive modeling related studies.'

Abstract: 'An extracellular lipase-producing bacterium was isolated from a fecal sample of lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus), an endangered Old World monkey that is endemic to the Western Ghats of South India. Morphological, biochemical and molecular analyses identified the bacterium as Serratia marcescens. Production of lipase was investigated in shake-flask culture. Optimum tributyrin concentration of 1.5\xc2\xa0% was found to be the most suitable triglyceride to increase lipase production (13.3\xc2\xa0U ml\xe2\x88\x921). The next best lipid source observed was olive oil (11.94\xc2\xa0U ml\xe2\x88\x921), followed by castor oil, coconut oil and palm oil. Analyzing the effect of different carbon sources on lipase production revealed that 2\xc2\xa0% glucose yielded higher lipase production than the other tested carbon sources. Investigations on suitable nitrogen source for lipase production revealed that 2\xc2\xa0% meat extract yielded higher lipase production. The most suitable trace element for maximum lipase production was zinc sulfate, followed by magnesium sulfate and copper sulfate. Partial characterization of the crude lipase revealed that pH\xc2\xa07.0 and a temperature of 40\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C gave optimal lipase activity. Enzymatic activity of the crude sample was retained over a wide temperature range (20\xe2\x80\x9375\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C), and 70\xc2\xa0% of enzyme activity was retained at 60\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C. Testing the effect of various organic solvents on lipase activity revealed that hexadecane increased lipase activity by 85\xc2\xa0% over the control.'

Abstract: 'For any conservation strategy to be effective, it must be preceded by knowledge of how diversity is configured within the area of interest. Here, data from 40 savanna-grassland sites were used to examine how plant biodiversity and species composition varied across spatial scales at the Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (KMTR), south India. Grasslands surveyed contained 278 plant species, and were characterized by high spatial variability in species association patterns. Fourteen distinct community assemblages were identified, organized primarily along an elevation gradient in the reserve. Overall, grasslands at KMTR were characterized by the dominance of a few, widespread species. The bulk of species richness, however, resulted from subordinate species with fairly restricted distributions. At low elevations, grasslands had high species richness and species composition differed greatly between sites. Mid-elevation grasslands contained about half the number of species present at low elevations, but sites were more similar in species composition. Richness of high-elevation grasslands was a third of that found at low elevations, but different sites harbored unique sets of species. Herbivore use of grasslands varied between communities and showed patterns that coincided with elevation. Herbivore use of low-elevation communities was high albeit variable, of mid-elevation sites was consistently low, and increased at higher elevations. Tall grass communities were the least utilized by herbivores at all elevations. Most species surveyed were rare and restricted in their distribution suggesting that conservation efforts must, perforce, encompass the entire reserve. However, differences in the structuring of diversity across elevations, and in herbivore use of grasslands, suggest that conservation efforts can be partitioned differentially across locations, specifically targeting low and high elevation grasslands in the reserve.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation studies have attracted considerable attention over the past two decades. Analyses of local deforestation examine the significance of numerous explanatory variables for the extraction of forest products. This study distinguishes among the explanatory variables as household-specific and site-specific, and argues for in-depth analysis of household-specific variables. It examines the role of household size, income, and education on firewood extraction and beedi-making in the Western Ghats of India, a hotspot of biodiversity. The study documents the incidence of these livelihoods, investigates the interaction among the three variables, and uses logistic regression models to determine the exact probability for the livelihoods. Two novel features of the study include analysis of wood and non-wood extraction through a single dataset and determination of model by the data. The results show high dependency of households on forest-based livelihoods, situations when the probability of livelihoods changes substantially, and non-parallel trends for household dependency. The study suggests the role of household-specific variables as the agents of motivation and persistence for forest-based livelihoods and presents a hypothesis about the critical size of household in forest dependency. The study recommends four measures\xe2\x80\x94harvest of ecosystem services, rise in income, migration and mobility, and environmental education\xe2\x80\x94to promote sustainable livelihoods.'

Abstract: 'Culturally protected forest patches or sacred groves have been the integral part of many traditional societies. This age old tradition is a classic instance of community driven nature conservation sheltering native biodiversity and supporting various ecosystem functions particularly hydrology. The current work in Central Western Ghats of Karnataka, India, highlights that even small sacred groves amidst humanised landscapes serve as tiny islands of biodiversity, especially of rare and endemic species. Temporal analysis of landuse dynamics reveals the changing pattern of the studied landscape. There is fast reduction of forest cover (15.14\xe2\x80\x9311.02\xc2\xa0%) in last 20\xc2\xa0years to meet up the demand of agricultural land and plantation programs. A thorough survey and assessment of woody endemic species distribution in the 25\xc2\xa0km2 study area documented presence of 19 endemic species. The distribution of these species is highly skewed towards the culturally protected patches in comparison to other land use elements. It is found that, among the 19 woody endemic species, those with greater ecological amplitude are widely distributed in the studied landscape in groves as well as other land use forms whereas, natural population of the sensitive endemics are very much restricted in the sacred grove fragments. The recent degradation in the sacred grove system is perhaps, due to weakening of traditional belief systems and associated laxity in grove protection leading to biotic disturbances. Revitalisation of traditional practices related to conservation of sacred groves can go a long way in strengthening natural ecological systems of fragile humid tropical landscape.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation is a primary driver of biotic extinctions in the tropics. The impacts of deforestation in tropical biodiversity hotspots are of particular concern because these regions contain high concentrations of globally endemic species. However, the effects of large-scale deforestation on native biotas within the biodiversity hotspot of Himalaya remain poorly documented. Here we report on an alarming trend of deforestation in the Indian Himalaya and project the likely consequential extinctions of endemic taxa (species and subspecies) by 2100 across a broad range of taxonomic groups, including gymnosperms, angiosperms, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. With the current level of deforestation, by 2100 only about 10% of the land area of the Indian Himalaya will be covered by dense forest (>40% canopy cover)\xe2\x80\x94a scenario in which almost a quarter of the endemic species could be wiped out, including 366 endemic vascular plant taxa and 35 endemic vertebrate taxa. We also show that inaccurate reporting of forest cover data by governmental institutions can result in underestimations of the biological impacts of deforestation, as well as potential miscalculations in land-use decisions (e.g., the construction of hydroelectric dams). Large-scale conservation efforts, including forest protection and reforestation, are urgently needed to avoid the impending deforestation-driven biodiversity losses in the Himalaya.'

Abstract: 'Impact of anthropogenic disturbance on species diversity and vegetation structure of a lowland tropical rainforest was studied in the foothills of Eastern Himalaya, India. Tree species richness, density, basal area and the diversity indices were found significantly (P<0.05) decreased with the increasing level of disturbances whereas, shrub density, basal area and herb density significantly increased with increasing disturbance level. In case of shrubs, Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s dominance index significantly (P<0.007) increased along the disturbance gradient, whereas Pielou\xe2\x80\x99s evenness index significantly (P<0.005) decreased with an increasing level of disturbance. Shannon-Weiner diversity index for herbs significantly (P<0.016) increased with increasing disturbance whereas, Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s dominance index was significantly (P<0.013) declined along the disturbance gradient. Results revealed that 10\xe2\x80\x9350 cm dbh classes constituted the highest stem density, and highest basal area was recorded in the >100 cm dbh class in all three sites. Density of the matured trees decreased with increasing DBH whereas, tree basal area tended to increase with increasing DBH in all three sites. Tree species richness was highest in the lower DBH classes. 62.07% of the total tree species regenerated in the largely undisturbed site followed by 50% in the mildly disturbed and 26.32% in the highly disturbed site. The overall regeneration condition was found to be good in the largely undisturbed site. Mildly disturbed site exhibited fair regeneration and so was in the highly disturbed site. Discernable variations in species composition, diversity, regeneration and tree population structure revealed the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on rainforest vegetation dynamics. Higher degree of disturbance was furtherly found not only affecting species diversity but also promoting the growth of invasive weed species. Dominance of Hydnocarpus kurzii and Crypteronia paniculata in the highly disturbed site also indicated that these less-valued timber species may benefit from the vegetation mosaic produced by the disturbance; so differences in abundance of these species may be useful for bio-indication. Furthermore, present study suggests the need of adequate biodiversity conservation measures and adaptation of sustainable forest management approaches in disturbed areas of lowland tropical rainforest in the foothills of eastern Himalaya, India.'

Abstract: 'The genus Isoetes L. in India is represented by 14species, of which eight species are recognized as being local endemics [confinedto one particular phyto-geographical division (PGD)] while the remaining sixoccur in more than one PGD and are described as endemic to a wider range. Thelocal endemic species are Isoetes dixitei,Isoetes panchganiensis and Isoetessahyadriensis in Western Ghats region; Isoetespantii, Isoetes bilaspurensis, Isoetesreticulata and Isoetes tuberculata inChotanagpur Malwa Vindhya Plateau and Isoetes debii innortheastern India. The wider endemic species are Isoetespanchananii, Isoetes sampathkumaranii,Isoetes rajasthanensis, Isoetesmahadevensis, Isoetes indica andIsoetes coromandelina. Our studies on the patterns ofendemism suggest that the radiation of quillworts advanced from dry lowlandareas to the rainy uplands and mountains. Isoetescoromandelina is the first Indian quillwort to colonize in lowlandsof the coastal zone (Coromandel), from where it spread to different parts of thesub-continent and gave rise to new species. Thus this species is a key Indianspecies which has played an important role in the radiation of quillwort in thecountry and appeared as the connecting link among the quillwort flora of variousPGDs. The centres of diversity for almost all the presently known Indianquillworts species are recognized.'

Abstract: 'Data on the conservation status of 167 species of flowering plants presented here are from two representative sectors in south India: (a) the lowlands, characterized by dry deciduous vegetation representative of the Deccan plateau, as also a cluster of eight low altitude hill ranges [to 1200 (1500) m] of the southernmost reaches of the Eastern Ghats of India, and coastlands including mangroves; and (b) the hills, the high altitude hill ranges (to 2475 m) of the Palni hills, an eastward spur of the Western Ghats of India, characterized by evergreen vegetation but largely decimated around the hill station of Kodaikanal with the invasion of alien species since the l840s with the arrival of overseas colonial personnel and the raising of commercial monoculture plantations. Data for the 167 species are entered in 7 + 1 columns for the two regions separately. However, the IUCN red list categories are not used in their entirety for two reasons: (i) the areas are relatively small; (ii) the stress comes more from extrinsic causes like habitat destruction and over-exploitation rather than intrinsic (genetic) causes. However, it is stressed that what is happening over restricted areas over short time intervals is a miniature of what is happening over larger areas over longer periods, and hence these data are vitally important in planning for conservation and eco-restoration. The quality and quantity of new information are decisive; the findings are discussed under nine heads, as the first synthesis of results obtained from over two decades of field work.'

Abstract: 'Gray slender lorises (Loris lydekkerianus) are 1 of 2 nocturnal primate genera occurring in India. Although the distribution and abundance of the species is known for some parts of southern India, the relative distribution of the 2 subspecies, Loris lydekkerianus lydekkerianus and L. l. malabaricus, and their comparative densities and extent of overlap between their distributions remains largely unknown. We investigated the distribution pattern and relative density of slender lorises in the Western Ghats mountain range in the state of Kerala in southern India. We surveyed 36 forest ranges in 17 forest divisions of northern and central Kerala from February to November 2009 for the presence of lorises. We sighted slender lorises in 22 forest ranges in a variety of vegetation types, and the relative abundance of the species ranged from 0.02 to 1.44 lorises/km. Our results confirm that both loris subspecies are present in Kerala: Mysore slender lorises have a narrow patchy distribution on the eastern edges of the Western Ghats mountain range, and Malabar slender lorises have a fairly contiguous distribution on the western slopes of the Western Ghats. We recommend more detailed surveys in southern Kerala to identify the distribution patterns of the subspecies in these areas.'

Abstract: 'The present study carried out with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of DNA extracted from rhizosphere soils of Rauwolfia spp. collected from Western Ghat (WG) regions of Karnataka indicated that Pseudomonas sp. was prevalently found followed by Methylobacterium sp., Bacillus sp. and uncultured bacteria. A total of 200 rhizobacteria were isolated from 58 rhizosphere soil samples comprising of 15 different bacterial genera. The Shannon Weaver diversity index (H\xe2\x80\xb2) and Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s diversity index (D) were found to be 2.57 and 0.91 for cultivable bacteria, respectively. The total species richness of cultivable rhizobacteria was high in Coorg district comprising 15 bacterial genera while in Mysore district, four bacterial genera were recorded. Rarefaction curve analysis also indicated the presence of higher species richness in samples of Shimoga and Coorg. All the rhizobacteria were screened for their multiple plant growth promotion and disease suppression traits. The results revealed that 70\xc2\xa0% of the isolates colonized tomato roots, 42\xc2\xa0% produced indole acetic acid, 55\xc2\xa0% solubilized phosphorus, while 43, 22, 27, 19, 40, 15 and 44\xc2\xa0% produced siderophore, salicylic acid, hydrogen cyanide, chitinase, phytase, cellulase and protease, respectively. Rhizobacterial isolates showing antagonistic activity against Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus flavus were 53 and 33\xc2\xa0%, respectively. Plant growth promotion studies revealed that most of the isolates increased percent germination with significantly higher vigour index as compared to untreated control. Most predominant rhizobacteria found in the rhizospheres of Rauwolfia spp. of WG regions are potential PGPR which can serve as biofertilizers and biopesticides.'

Abstract: 'This review is intended to contribute to the understanding of the interlinkage between wildfire in India\xe2\x80\x99s tropical dry forest (TDF) and selected ecosystem services (ES), namely forest provisioning and water regulating services, as well as biodiversity. TDF covers approximately 146,000\xc2\xa0km2 (4.4\xc2\xa0%) of India, whereas according to the MODIS fire product\xc2\xa0about 2200\xc2\xa0km2 (1.4\xc2\xa0%) burns per year. As studies on wildfire effects upon ESs and biodiversity in Indian TDFs are rare we partly transferred findings from other (dry) forest areas to the environmental situation in India. In India (intentionally lit) wildfires have a very important connection to local livelihoods and the availability of non-wood forest products. Very important adverse long-term effects are the deterioration of forest ecosystems and soil degradation. The potential for TDF to regulate hydrological cycles is expected to be greater in the absence of fire than with it. A general judgment on the effect of fire on biodiversity is difficult as it depends on the community and species involved but a loss of biodiversity under regular burnings is apparent. Consequently, forest managers need sound knowledge regarding the interplay of wildfires and ecosystem behavior in general and more specific knowledge regarding the effects on taxa being considered for conservation efforts. Generally, much more research is needed to understand the trade-offs between the short-term benefits gained from forest provisioning services and long-term adverse effects.'

Abstract: 'Species diversity, population structure, abundance and dispersion patterns of all woody plants \xe2\x89\xa510cm gbh were inventoried in two 1-ha plots of tropical dry evergreen (sacred grove or temple) forests at Kuzhanthaikuppam (KK) and Thirumanikkuzhi (TM) on the Coromandel coast of south India. Site KK is a stunted forest (average tree height ca 6 m) and TM a tall forest (average tree height ca 10 m). A total of 54 species (in 47 genera and 31 families) were recorded. Species richness and stand density were 42 and 38 species and 1367 and 974 individuals ha\xe2\x88\x921 respectively for the sites KK and TM. About 50% of the total species were common to both the sites. Site TM is twofold more voluminous (basal area 29.48 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921) than KK (basal area 15.44 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921). Nearly one third of the individuals are multi-stemmed in the low-statured site KK whereas one fourth of the tree density is multi-stemmed in TM. Species abundance pattern varied between the two sites. The abundance of three species in KK and two species in TM is pronounced. Memecylon umbellatum, the most abundant species contributing to one third of total stand density in KK, is least represented in TM. Species richness, density and diversity indices decreased with increasing girth threshold. Most species exhibited clumped dispersion of individuals both at 0.25 and 1-ha scales. Population structure for girth frequency is an expanding one for both the sites, except for basal area distribution in KK. Variations in plant diversity and abundance are related to site attributes and human impacts. In the light of habitat uniqueness, species richness and sacred grove status, the need for conservation is emphasized.'

Abstract: 'We make an assessment of the impact of projected climate change on forest ecosystems in India. This assessment is based on climate projections of the Regional Climate Model of the Hadley Centre (HadRM3) and the dynamic global vegetation model IBIS for A2 and B2 scenarios. According to the model projections, 39% of forest grids are likely to undergo vegetation type change under the A2 scenario and 34% under the B2 scenario by the end of this century. However, in many forest dominant states such as Chattisgarh, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh up to 73%, 67% and 62% of forested grids are projected to undergo change. Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is projected to increase by 68.8% and 51.2% under the A2 and B2 scenarios, respectively, and soil organic carbon (SOC) by 37.5% for A2 and 30.2% for B2 scenario. Based on the dynamic global vegetation modeling, we present a forest vulnerability index for India which is based on the observed datasets of forest density, forest biodiversity as well as model predicted vegetation type shift estimates for forested grids. The vulnerability index suggests that upper Himalayas, northern and central parts of Western Ghats and parts of central India are most vulnerable to projected impacts of climate change, while Northeastern forests are more resilient. Thus our study points to the need for developing and implementing adaptation strategies to reduce vulnerability of forests to projected climate change.'

Abstract: 'Ten-day advanced very high resolution radiometer images from 1990 to 2000 were used to examine spatial patterns in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and their relationships with climatic variables for four contrasting forest types in India. The NDVI signal has been extracted from homogeneous vegetation patches and has been found to be distinct for deciduous and evergreen forest types, although the mixed-deciduous signal was close to the deciduous ones. To examine the decadal response of the satellite-measured vegetation phenology to climate variability, seven different NDVI metrics were calculated using the 11-year NDVI data. Results suggested strong spatial variability in forest NDVI metrics. Among the forest types studied, wet evergreen forests of north-east India had highest mean NDVI (0.692) followed by evergreen forests of the Western Ghats (0.529), mixed deciduous forests (0.519) and finally dry deciduous forests (0.421). The sum of NDVI (SNDVI) and the time-integrated NDVI followed a similar pattern, although the values for mixed deciduous forests were closer to those for evergreen forests of the Western Ghats. Dry deciduous forests had higher values of inter-annual range (RNDVI) and low mean NDVI, also coinciding with a high SD and thus a high coefficient of variation (CV) in NDVI (CVNDVI). SNDVI has been found to be high for wet evergreen forests of north-east India, followed by evergreen forests of the Western Ghats, mixed deciduous forests and dry deciduous forests. Further, the maximum NDVI values of wet evergreen forests of north-east India (0.624) coincided with relatively high annual total precipitation (2,238.9\xc2\xa0mm). The time lags had a strong influence in the correlation coefficients between annual total rainfall and NDVI. The correlation coefficients were found to be comparatively high (R2=0.635) for dry deciduous forests than for evergreen forests and mixed deciduous forests, when the precipitation data with a lag of 30 days was correlated against NDVI. Using multiple regression approach models were developed for individual forest types using 16 different climatic indices. A high proportion of the temporal variance (>90%) has been accounted for by three of the precipitation parameters (maximum precipitation, precipitation of the wettest quarter and driest quarter) and two of the temperature parameters (annual mean temperature and temperature of the coldest quarter) for mixed deciduous forests. Similarly, in the case of deciduous forests, four precipitation parameters and three temperature parameters explained nearly 83.6% of the variance. These results suggest differences in the relationship between NDVI and climatic variables based upon the time of growing season, time interval and climatic indices over which they were summed. These results have implications for forest cover mapping and monitoring in tropical regions of India.'

Abstract: 'The goal of biodiversity hotspots is to identify regions around the world where conservation priorities should be focused. We undertake a geographic information system and remote sensing analysis to identify the rarest and least protected forests in biodiversity hotspots. World Wildlife Fund ecoregions with terrestrial forest were subset from 34 biodiversity hotspots and forest cover calculated from GlobCover data at a 300\xc2\xa0m pixel resolution. There were 276 ecoregions in 32 biodiversity hotspots classified as containing terrestrial forests. When the first quartile of forest ecoregions was subset based on smallest extent of forest cover in protected areas, there were 69 rare forests identified within 20 biodiversity hotspots. Most rare forest ecoregions (45) occurred on islands or island archipelagos and 47 rare forest ecoregions contained less than 10\xc2\xa0% forest cover in protected areas. San F\xc3\xa9lix-San Ambrosio Islands Temperate Forests, Tubuai Tropical Moist Forests, Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago Tropical Moist Forests, and Yap Tropical Dry Forests were identified as the least protected and possibly most vulnerable forests within biodiversity hotspots. These ecoregions cover less than 500\xc2\xa0km2, forest cover is less than 50\xc2\xa0km2, and there are no protected areas. There is a need to update classifications and boundaries of protected areas, insure that islands are included in global land cover datasets, and identify levels of endemism and endangerment within forest ecoregions. This should improve our ability to compare, prioritize, and monitor forests in biodiversity hotspots.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity loss is a problem of global concern affecting ecosystem functioning and services provided to humans. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is built on a conceptual framework that links biodiversity with the services ecosystems provide to society and human welfare. Numerous empirical studies have measured ecosystem goods and services in terms of economic values; however, less evidence is available of the indirect effect of biodiversity on these values. Based on this, we first compile market and non-market forest valuation studies and, secondly, explore the potential of an econometric modelling exercise by conducting a worldwide meta-analysis. This exercise aims to highlight the role of biodiversity indicators on valuation. In this way, we can study the underlying transmission mechanisms that explain to what extent biodiversity is related to human welfare. Furthermore, we also propose to evaluate the magnitudes of the respective distributional impacts, including the different ecosystem goods and services under consideration. Our results show that biodiversity indicators may have an underlying effect on forest ecosystem values, which also depend on the type of ecosystem services. Lastly, the results are discussed and analysed with respect to their policy implications concerning biodiversity conservation.'

Abstract: 'India, a mega-diverse country, possesses a wide range of climate and vegetation types along with a varied topography. The present study has classified forest types of India based on multi-season IRS Resourcesat-2 Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) data. The study has characterized 29 land use/land cover classes including 14 forest types and seven scrub types. Hybrid classification approach has been used for the classification of forest types. The classification of vegetation has been carried out based on the ecological rule bases followed by Champion and Seth\xe2\x80\x99s (1968) scheme of forest types in India. The present classification scheme has been compared with the available global and national level land cover products. The natural vegetation cover was estimated to be 29.36\xc2\xa0% of total geographical area of India. The predominant forest types of India are tropical dry deciduous and tropical moist deciduous. Of the total forest cover, tropical dry deciduous forests occupy an area of 2,17,713\xc2\xa0km2 (34.80\xc2\xa0%) followed by 2,07,649\xc2\xa0km2 (33.19\xc2\xa0%) under tropical moist deciduous forests, 48,295\xc2\xa0km2 (7.72\xc2\xa0%) under tropical semi-evergreen forests and 47,192\xc2\xa0km2 (7.54\xc2\xa0%) under tropical wet evergreen forests. The study has brought out a comprehensive vegetation cover and forest type maps based on inputs critical in defining the various categories of vegetation and forest types. This spatially explicit database will be highly useful for the studies related to changes in various forest types, carbon stocks, climate-vegetation modeling and biogeochemical cycles.'

Abstract: 'Tree species diversity and population structure at different community types were described and analyzed for primary and secondary lowland moist deciduous forests in Tripura. Overall 10,957 individual trees belonging to 46 family, 103 genera and 144 species were counted at \xe2\x89\xa530 cm DBH (diameter at breast height) using 28 permanent belt transects with a size of 1 ha (10 m \xc3\x97 1000 m). Four different tree communities were identified. The primary forests was dominated by Shorea robusta (mean density 464.77 trees\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, 105 species) and Schima wallichii (336.25 trees\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, 82 species), while the secondary forests was dominated by Tectona grandis (333.88 trees\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, 105 species) and Hevea brasiliensis (299.67 trees\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, 82 species). Overall mean basal area in this study was 18.01m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921; the maximum value was recorded in primary Shorea forest (26.21 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921). Mean density and diversity indices were differed significantly within four different communities. No significant differences were observed in number of species, genera, family and tree basal cover area. Significant relationships were found between the species richness and different tree population groups across the communities. Results revealed that species diversity and density were increased in those forests due to past disturbances which resulted in slow accumulation of native oligarchic small tree species. Seventeen species were recorded with <2 individuals of which Saraca asoka (Roxb.) de Wilde and Entada phaseoloides (L.) Merr. etc. extensively used in local ethno-medicinal formulations. The present S. robusta Gaertn dominated forest was recorded richer (105 species) than other reported studies. Moraceae was found more speciose family instead of Papilionaceae and Euphorbiaceae than other Indian moist deciduous forests. Seasonal phenological gap in such moist deciduous forests influenced the population of Trachypithecus pileatus and capped langur. The analysis of FIV suggested a slow trend of shifting the population of Lamiaceae group by Moraceae species in secondary T. grandis L. dominated community.'

Abstract: 'Panna National Park is situated in the north-central part of Madhya Pradesh, India. Landscape parameters like fragmentation, porosity, patchiness and jaxtaposition have been analysed for disturbance gradient characterization. Disturbance on biodiversity due to human activities has been studied both qualitatively and quantitatively. The species richness is highest in northern mixed dry deciduous forest followed by dry deciduous open scrub and southern tropical dry deciduous teak forest. Species richness of the open thorny dry deciduous forest with grasses is found to be the lowest. Disturbance analysis indicates that 22.02% of the southern slightly moist teak forests are highly disturbed whereas Anogeissus forest and Riverine forest have 17.04% and 12.41% of the area under high disturbance, respectively. A total of 88 field sample plots were laid to enumerate trees, shrubs, herbs, climbers, etc. Biological richness parameters such as Shannon-Wiener biodiversity index, biodiversity value, ecosystem uniqueness were derived from field data. High biological richness is found in northern mixed dry deciduous forest and mixed dry deciduous forest with bamboo. More than 99% of such areas are falling under medium to high biological richness. Nearly 55% of the gentle and flat to gentle, slope categories were found to have low biological richness.'

Abstract: 'Spatial distribution, abundance and assemblage of termites depend mainly on the local conditions and habitats in which they thrive. Striking differences are observed in the species richness, number of clades and functional diversity of termite assemblage between different habitats. This study aim was to examine effect of human interference in the diversity of wood destroying termite in forest areas as well as managed and unmanaged plantations in South India. Termites attacking trees and wooden logs were collected from forest areas, managed plantations and unmanaged plantations. The termites collected were identified and compared for species abundance, richness and species diversity. Results show that the species composition and species diversity of the wood destroying termites vary according to the conditions. The species diversity measures revealed that there is a significance variation among the forest fauna and plantations. The forest areas have the highest species composition compared to plantations. Species richness is high forest areas. Even though the abundance of termites are more in unmanaged plantations, there is no significant difference related to species diversity among the managed and unmanaged plantations.'

Abstract: 'Species richness and density of understory plants were investigated in eight 1\xc2\xa0ha plots, distributed one each in undisturbed and disturbed tropical evergreen, semi-evergreen, deciduous and littoral forests of Little Andaman island, India, which falls under one of the eight hottest hotspots of Biodiversity in the world viz. the Indo-Burma. One hundred 1\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 quadrats were established in each 1\xc2\xa0ha plot, in which all the understory plants (that include herbs, undershrubs, shrubs and herbaceous climbers) were enumerated. The total density of understory plants was 6,812 individuals (851\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) and species richness was 108 species, representing 104 genera and 50 families. Across the four forest types and eight study plots, the species richness ranged from 10 to 39\xc2\xa0species\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. All the disturbed sites harbored greater number of species than their undisturbed counterparts. Herbs dominated by species (63%) and density (4,259 individuals). The grass Eragrostis tenella (1,860 individuals; IVI 40), the invasive climber Mikania cordata (803; IVI 20) and the shrub Anaxagorea luzonensis (481; IVI 17.5) were the most abundant species. Poaceae, Asteraceae, Acanthaceae, Orchidaceae and Euphorbiaceae constituted the species-rich families represented by 6 species each. The species-area curves attained an asymptote at 0.8\xc2\xa0ha level except in sites DD and DL, indicating 1\xc2\xa0ha plot is not sufficient to capture all the understory species in disturbed forests. The alien weeds formed about one-fourth of the species richness (31 species; 28%) and density (1,926 individuals; 28.3%) in the study sites, indicating the extent of weed invasion and the attention required for effective conservation of the native biodiversity of the fragile island forest ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'A study was carried out examining the effects of conservation policy on the ecosystem and livelihoods of local people on the Rajiv Gandhi National Park, located in one of the global biodiversity hotspots, the Western Ghats, India. Results show that less than 5% of the people are in favor of the policies while a staggering 94% of the people are strongly against the policies. The remaining 1% of the total respondents are found neutral with regard to conservation policies. Several reasons viz., ban on agriculture, restriction on livestock rearing and grazing, ban on non-timber forest collection, exclusion of local and indigenous communities in conservation programs and tourism activities are found to be responsible for negative attitude towards the national park. Apart from limiting the local livelihood options, the anticipated ecological consequences are not encouraging as exotic species are dominating the vegetation dynamics of the area\xe2\x80\x94replacing many native plant species. The fact is that the inextricable link between nature and society needs an integrated science-policy research approach for biodiversity conservation in the hotspots, particularly in the developing countries where human and ecosystem interactions are much more complex and closely interwoven with each other.'

Abstract: 'Natural vegetation on the south-eastern coast of Peninsular India has now been reduced to patches, some of which are preserved as sacred groves. The plant biodiversity and population structure of woody plants (>20 cm girth at breast height; gbh) in two such groves, Oorani and Olagapuram, occurring on the north-west of Pondicherry have been analyzed. A total of 169 angiosperms have been enumerated from both sites. The Oorani grove (3.2 ha) had 74 flowering plant species distributed in 71 genera and 41 families; 30 of them are woody species, 8 are lianas and 4 are parasites. The Olagapuram grove (2.8 ha) was more species-rich with 136 species in 121 genera of 58 families; woody species were fewer (21) while 9 lianas and 3 parasites occurred. The vegetation structure indicates that the Oorani grove is a relic of tropical dry evergreen forest, whereas Olagapuram is reduced to a thorny woodland. The latter is heavily degraded as it has lost the status of a sacred grove because of its conversion to Eucalyptus plantations. The Oorani grove has an Amman temple in the centre. The attendant cultural rites and religious rituals have perpetuated the status of a sacred grove which has ensured the protection of the grove.'

Abstract: 'The biodiversity hotspot concept was defined by Myers in 1988 to determine priority areas for conservation. They have high endemism levels and have lost more than 70% of their original vegetated area. To date, there is little information on arthropod diversity in these zones. This work focuses on the biodiversity of the Phytoseiidae (Acari), one of the best known among the order Mesostigmata, in these threatened areas. These mites are usually predators and they are worldwide spread. Geographic distribution of phytoseiids in 27 biodiversity hostspots was assessed from data of the last world catalogue published in 2004. One thousand two hundred and thirty species are reported from at least one hotspot (62% of the total species number) and 604 species (30% of the total species number) are endemic to the 27 hotspots considered. The number of reports/publication in hotspot areas (2.6) is higher than in non-hotspot zones (1.5). Hotspots areas could be thus considered as a great reservoir of the Phytoseiidae diversity, just as they are for vertebrates and plants. Correlations between plant, vertebrate, mite diversity and endemism, as well as congruence rates between endemism levels of these three organisms suggest that the biodiversity patterns of plants and vertebrates mirror well those of the Phytoseiidae (both for endemicity and species richness). More intense conservation efforts in biodiversity hotspots would thus be assumed to affect plant and vertebrate biodiversity, as already known, but also arthropod biodiversity, as it was assumed. These results further support thus the importance of these zones in biodiversity conservation, even for organisms like mites, very small and poorly studied in this regards. More data on arthropods are, however, required to confirm these preliminary observations.'

Abstract: 'India is known for its rich heritage of biodiversity. In biological diversity parlance, India is one of the 17 mega-diverse countries in the world. With only 2.4\xc2\xa0% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s area, India accounts for 7\xe2\x80\x938\xc2\xa0% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s recorded plant and animal species. India\xe2\x80\x99s ten biogeographic zones possess an exemplary diversity of ecological habitats like alpine forests, grasslands, wetlands, coastal and marine ecosystems, and desert ecosystems. The large mosaic of distinct agro-ecosystems has contributed to diverse cropping pattern and systems across the country. Amongst the existing biota, 91,307 species of animals of which 2,557 Protista, 12,470 general invertebrates, 69,903 arthropods, 4,994 vertebrates, and 45,500 species of plants as well as 5,650 microbial species have been documented in its 10 bio-geographic regions. India has four out of thirty-four global biodiversity hotspots, which is an indicator of high degree of endemism (of species) in India. About 5,150 plant species and 1,837 animal species are endemic to India. India\xe2\x80\x99s biodiversity includes wild relatives of agricultural crops and domesticated animals. India has 16 major types and 251 subtypes of forests. Indigenous medicine systems utilize nearly 6,500 native plants for both human and animal healthcare. India\xe2\x80\x99s diverse preponderance of native tribal and ethnic groups has contributed significantly in the conservation and diversification of biodiversity. Its cultural and ethnic diversity includes over 550 tribal communities of 227 ethnic groups spread over 5,000 forested villages. India proudly upholds the tradition of nature conservation. In 252 B.C., the Emperor Asoka established protected areas (PAs) for mammals, birds, fish and forests through a proclamation. Jim Corbett National Park covering an area of 325\xc2\xa0sq\xc2\xa0km came into being as the India\xe2\x80\x99s first and world\xe2\x80\x99s third National Park in 1936. India has currently 4.79\xc2\xa0% of total geographic area under an elaborate network of PAs, which includes 99 National Parks, 513 wildlife sanctuaries, 43 conservation reserves, 4 community reserves and 3 biodiversity heritage sites. India has a National Wildlife Action Plan, which envisages 10\xc2\xa0% of the geographical area of the country under PA coverage. In India, the accelerated loss of biodiversity components over the last few decades has been of great concern. Environmental changes, overexploitation and habitat loss are among the major causes of species loss that, according to certain estimates, is of the order of a species per day. The richness of India\xe2\x80\x99s biological resources and related indigenous knowledge is an asset that needs to be cherished, conserved and judiciously utilized. One of the major challenges before the country lies in adopting a system which helps in utilizing this biodiversity for benefit of humankind without compromising on risking the loss. The intrinsic value of biological diversity and of the ecological, genetic, social, economic, scientific, educational, cultural, recreational and aesthetic values and its components are to be taken care properly for the better management of biological resources and biodiversity for the welfare of human beings for better, and healthier as well as peaceful living on earth. The conservation of biological diversity is a serious and common concern of human beings for better living. The general lack of information and knowledge regarding biological diversity and of the urgent need to develop scientific, technical and institutional capacities to provide the basic understanding is important to plan and implement appropriate measures. It should be recognized that the women in rural play a vital role in the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and affirming the need for the full participation of women at all levels of policy making and implementation for biological diversity conservation. Biodiversity is an important component for economic and social development and poverty eradication and overriding priorities of most of the developing countries in the world. The conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity is critical importance of meeting of food, fodder, fiber, health, water and other needs of growing world population for which purpose, access to and sharing of both genetic resources and technologies are essential. It should be determined to conserve and sustainable use of biological diversity for the benefit of present and future generations.'

Abstract: 'An analysis of human population trends from 2000 to 2010 shows that of the roughly one billion additional people on the planet today, a disproportionate number live in the biodiversity hotspots and tropical wilderness areas (TWAs). Although the annual population growth rate in the hotspots declined from 1.6 to 1.3\xc2\xa0%, the total population increased by 187 million people. While less densely populated, the TWAs grew at roughly twice the rate of the hotspots. Overall, slower growth rates are indicative of longer-term global trends in decreasing fertility, aging populations, and increased urbanization. The hotspots, however, are largely inhabited by people who have yet to enter their reproductive years or are in the early stages therein. The young age structure means that populations in these priority conservation areas will grow even as fertility rates fall further, and biodiversity will be forced to share dwindling natural habitat with ever more people.'

Abstract: 'Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and microsatellite markers were applied to evaluate the genetic variation in endemic and endangered yellow catfish, Horabagrus brachysoma sampled from three geographic locations of Western Ghat, South India river systems. In RAPD, of 32 10-mer RAPD primers screened initially, 10 were chosen and used in a comparative analysis of H. brachysoma collected from Meenachil, Chalakkudy and Nethravathi River systems. Of the 124 total RAPD fragments amplified, 49 (39.51%) were found to be shared by individuals of all 3 populations. The remaining 75 fragments were found to be polymorphic (60.48%). In microsatellites, six polymorphic microsatellite loci were identified by using primers developed for Pangasius hypophthalmus, Clarias macrocephalus and Clarias gariepinus. The identified loci were confirmed as microsatellite by sequencing after making a clone. The nucleotide sequences of 6 loci were published in NCBI genbank. The number of alleles across the six loci ranged from 4 to 7 and heterozygosities ranged from 0.07 to 0.93. The mean number of alleles and effective number of alleles per locus were 5.00 and 3.314, respectively. The average heterozygosity across all investigated samples was 0.72, indicating a significant deficiency of heterozygotes in this species. RAPD and microsatellite methods reported a high degree of gene diversity and genetic distances depicted by UPGMA dendrograms among the populations of H. brachysoma.'

Abstract: 'The neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography emphasizes the importance of dispersal and speciation to macro-ecological diversity patterns. While the influence of dispersal has been studied quite extensively, the effect of speciation has not received much attention, even though it was already claimed at an early stage of neutral theory development that the mode of speciation would leave a signature on metacommunity structure. Here, we derive analytical expressions for the distribution of abundances according to the neutral model with recruitment (i.e., dispersal and establishment) limitation and random fission speciation which seems to be a more realistic description of (allopatric) speciation than the point mutation mode of speciation mostly used in neutral models. We find that the two modes of speciation behave qualitatively differently except when recruitment is strongly limited. Fitting the model to six large tropical tree data sets, we show that it performs worse than the original neutral model with point mutation speciation but yields more realistic predictions for speciation rates, species longevities, and rare species. Interestingly, we find that the metacommunity abundance distribution under random fission is identical to the broken-stick abundance distribution and thus provides a dynamical explanation for this grand old lady of abundance distributions.'

Title: 'Landscape Level Biodiversity Databases in India: Status and the Scope'

Abstract: 'Conservation of biodiversity requires management higher than the species level of organization, particularly at the landscape scale. It is, however, difficult to manage each threatened species individually. Alternatively, management can focus on the ecosystems that contain these species, and on the landscapes containing the ecosystems. The relatively new discipline of landscape ecology provides insight into both landscape diversity and the species diversity, and suggests a theoretical and practical basis for conservation planning. The information on the biodiversity characteristics such as species richness and their spatial distribution, economic, and the ethno-botanical importance is of great significance to any nation. The Department of Biotechnology and Department of Space, Government of India funded a nationwide project between 1998 and 2010 to characterize and map the flowering plants richness in the natural (forests, grasslands, scrub, etc.) and man-made (forest plantations) vegetation formations at landscape level. The spatial database on vegetation types generated using wet and dry season satellite imagery and ancillary data such as topographic maps and the species richness through field inventory were used to generate the spatially-explicit species distribution maps and statistics. A customized software package, SPLAM (Spatial Landscape Modeling) was developed for landscape analysis and spatial data integration. This, first of its kind unique study spanning over 12\xc2\xa0years, has resulted in a large baseline spatial database on vegetation types, porosity, patchiness, interspersion, juxtaposition, fragmentation, disturbance regimes, ecosystem uniqueness, terrain complexity and the species richness. The field inventory involved 16,581 geo-referenced 0.04\xc2\xa0ha plots across India and 7,761 plant species. The geospatially-tagged species database, created in the project, provides information on the endemic, rare, endangered, threatened, and medicinally/economically important species. The database, disseminated to large number of organizations including State Forest Departments, has found extensive applications in policy planning, operational management, biodiversity conservation, bio-prospecting, and the climate change studies.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity is the very basis of human survival and economic well-being, and encompasses all life forms, ecosystems and ecological processes. The current estimates of the total number of species on earth vary from 5 to more than 100\xc2\xa0million, with a more conservative figure of 13.6\xc2\xa0million species. Of these, only 1.78\xc2\xa0million species have yet been described and awarded scientific names. Thus, our knowledge of diversity is remarkably incomplete. Biodiversity at any point in time is the balance between the rates of speciation and extinction. Biodiversity is not uniformly distributed on the earth and shows prominent latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. At least five major mass extinctions have occurred in the past at geologic-time boundaries. Studies indicate that we have entered into the sixth phase of mass extinctions. In all ecosystem types, terrestrial, freshwater and marine, species populations are declining. The current rates of species extinction are 100\xe2\x80\x931000 times higher than the background rate of 10\xe2\x88\x927\xc2\xa0species/species year inferred from fossil record. It is now in the order of 1,000 species per decade per million species. Today we seem to be losing two to five species per hour from tropical forests alone. This amounts to a loss of 16\xc2\xa0m populations/year or 1,800 populations/h. Major drivers for changes of biodiversity in future, in decreasing rank of their impact are land use change, climate change, N deposition, biotic exchange and atmospheric loading of CO2. Accuracy of estimates of the total number of resident species and current rates of extinction remains undetermined, and the impact of species deletions on ecosystem function and stability is still a subject of debate among ecologists. There are two basic, often complementary strategies for biodiversity conservation. The in situ strategy emphasizes the protection of ecosystems for the conservation of overall diversity of genes, populations, species, communities and the ecological processes which are crucial for ecosystem services. Establishment of networks of protected areas are effective in this regard as these have the possibility to conserve primary forests and red-listed ecosystems. The concept of biodiversity banking could induce public participation. Establishment of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, an independent, international science panel (like IPCC) would help coordinate and highlight research on pressing topics, conduct periodic assessments on regional as well as global scales and provide predictions.'

Abstract: 'This study attempts to review the various biodiversity related parameters envisaged in the current national forest inventory (NFI) of India in comparison to those used worldwide as indicators of forest biodiversity. The study reveals that a good amount of biodiversity related parameters are available, covering the structural attribute of biodiversity, tree species composition, and other important functional attributes like deadwood and litter. In spite of this timber-based approach, a number of variables are available to talk on biodiversity aspects of Indian forests. However, the comparison with the parameters found in literature shows that the scope of further improvement does exist in current NFI\xe2\x80\x99s ability to contribute towards a documentation and management of biodiversity. Our gap analysis indicates that enhancing the capacity of the current NFI to generate overall biodiversity information urgently required for safeguarding and conserving the natural wealth of India is strongly needed.'

Abstract: 'In the context of over-consumption of natural resources in the name of development and rapid industrialization by a small section of the human population that is rapidly growing, the world is currently faced with a variety of environmental uncertainties. \xe2\x80\x98Global change\xe2\x80\x99 covering a whole variety of ecological issues, and \xe2\x80\x98globalization\xe2\x80\x99 in an economic sense, are two major phenomena that are responsible for these uncertainties. There is increasing evidence to suggest that the developing countries more than the developed, particularly the marginalized traditional (those living close to nature and natural resources) societies would be the worst sufferers. In order to cope with this problem in a situation where the traditional societies have to cope with rapidly depleting biodiversity on which they are dependant for their livelihood, there is an urgent need to explore additional pathways for sustainable management of natural resources and societal development. Such pathways should be based on a landscape management strategy, that takes into consideration the rich traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) that these societies have. This is critical because TEK is the connecting link between conservation and sustainable development. This paper explores the possibilities in this direction through a balanced approach to development, that links the \xe2\x80\x98traditional\xe2\x80\x99 with the \xe2\x80\x98modern\xe2\x80\x99, in a location-specific way.'

Abstract: 'Traditional shade coffee plantations of Kodagu district, in the Western Ghats of southern India, harbor a high density and diversity of trees. Local farmers appreciate native biodiversity, but plantation economics and public policies drive them to gradually replace the original diversified cover with exotic shade trees such as Grevillea robusta, which grows fast and can be easily traded as timber. In order to identify and recommend native timber trees with fast growth rates, we compared the growth performance of four common native species against that of G. robusta, by fitting steel dendrometer bands on 332 shade trees. Results showed that in general G. robusta had the fastest growth rates, but large trees of the native Acrocarpus fraxinifolius had faster growth in the wet western side of the district. Computer projections of long term performance showed that most species were influenced by bioclimatic zone. Species-specific local environmental effects also occurred, including competition from coffee bushes for A. fraxinifolius, influence of aspect for G. robusta, and management block effects for Lagerstroemia microcarpa. Our results show that native species  potentially could produce timber at rates equivalent to those of exotic species. However, as in many tropical countries, data on growth rates of native trees within mixed-cover plantations are scarce and this study underlines the urgent need to screen for fast-growing species. Such information provides a strong basis for recommending appropriate changes in public policies that would improve tree tenure security and encourage farmers to grow more native species.'

Abstract: 'Extensive surveys were conducted to explore the diversity of fishes, distribution patterns, abundance, threat, and habitat status in the upper, middle, and lower stretch of river Gomti, a tributary of river Ganga. Altogether 56 fish species belonging to 20 families and 42 genera were collected from various sampling sites. Of the 56 species, five belong to the \xe2\x80\x98endangered\xe2\x80\x99 (EN) category and 11 belong to the vulnerable (VU) category. Six major categories of habitat were identified and pattern of fish assemblage and dominant genera in each habitat studied. Considerable differences were observed in the fish species richness and relative abundance (RA) of the species in the different sampling sites of river Gomti. Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Wiener biodiversity index has been calculated for the fishes indicating considerable variation (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) across the river. Apart from Indian Major Carps (Labeo rohita, Catla catla, Cirrhinus mrigala), Chitala chitala, Notopterus notopterus, Ompok pabda, O. bimaculatus, Labeo bata, L. calbasu, Cirrhinus reba, Channa marulius, Bagarius bagarius, and Clupisoma garua were the important species. All the species have been reported for the first time in this river. Indiscriminate catch, poisoning, using of fine mesh sized nets, dumping of sewage, siltation, water abstraction, changing land use pattern, decreased water discharge, and exotic species threaten the fish diversity. Urgent need exists for taking up research on the priority fish species and their habitat. Restoration measures have been proposed based on ecosystem scale approach for fish biodiversity conservation.'

Abstract: 'Assessment of tree species diversity, structure and regeneration status of four sacred groves of Kushalnagar, southern Karnataka was carried out. The random quadrat method was employed in each grove for enumeration of tree diversity and regeneration status. A total of 98 tree species belonging to 38 families were found from the sampled areas. These groves possess higher diversity and basal area. Some 67\xc2\xa0% of species have shown regeneration, while 17\xc2\xa0% of species had no regeneration. Another 15\xc2\xa0% of species were reappearing or immigrating. It is observed that increased disturbance was directly proportional to number of reappearing or immigrating species and inversely proportional to the diversity in all the sacred groves. Significant impact on diversity, species richness and regeneration status of the flora due to manifold anthropogenic activities have been recorded.'

Abstract: 'Global conservation efforts have traditionally focused on biodiversity hotspots and other priority landscapes. However, large areas outside priority sites have high conservation value and are referred to as neglected landscapes. The Eastern Ghats of India is an unexplored forest landscape of high conservation value with several endemic and threatened species reported, and is also home to many indigenous forest-dwelling communities. However, it remains a neglected area for conservation and only 3.53% of this landscape is protected. Here, we examine the effectiveness of protected areas in neglected landscapes in preventing forest degradation, and how community perceptions can be used to understand satellite-based landscape change analyses at village level. This study was conducted in Papikonda National park (PNP) and its unprotected buffers in India\xe2\x80\x99s Eastern Ghats. Forest degradation was higher in the buffer (32%) than inside PNP (12%) between 1991 and 2014. Communities attributed shifting cultivation, plantations and over-extraction of forest resources as being the major drivers of forest degradation. Community observations of change were not significantly correlated with spatial measures of change. Forest degradation was higher outside the PA at a landscape level and inside the PA at the village level, therefore the PA was effective in reducing degradation at the landscape level but not at the village level inside the PA. We further discuss the role of community observations in interpreting forest degradation in neglected forest landscapes.'

Abstract: 'Freshwater ecosystems and associated habitats harbor incredible biodiversity. They offer various ecosystem services and sustain human livelihoods. However, due to increasing developmental pressure and rising water demand, these systems are under huge threat. As a result, many aquatic species are feared to become extinct in near future. Quantifying the patterns of aquatic species diversity and composition of river systems is urgently required. With this interest, we studied four river systems in the Western Ghats region, documenting the pattern of fish diversity and identifying the factors that influence fish species richness. Maintaining undisturbed streams and river basins, especially headwater regions is crucial for sustaining freshwater biodiversity in the tropical river ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'The montane closed evergreen forests found at altitudes above 1,800 m in the Western Ghats of India possess a distinct vegetation type and are called shola forests. Despite the fact that these forests are located in relatively inaccessible areas, they are still under anthropogenic pressure leading to continued habitat degradation and loss of biomass and biodiversity. A case study was conducted in Mananvan shola, the largest shola forest in Kerala of Western Ghats, to recognize the impact of disturbance on vegetation structure, composition and regeneration pattern, to identify the socio-economic reasons for disturbance and to evolve strategies for its management. In the disturbed part of the forest, dominance of light demanding species in tree, shrub and herb communities has been recorded. Here even the dominance of exotic species in tree seedling, shrub and herb communities is prominent. Skewed girth class distribution of tree community with poor representation by the individuals of girth class 30.1 to 90.0 cm, is also an indication of the collection of small wood and poles from the forest. The RISQ (Ramakrishnan Index of Stand Quality) in the disturbed area of the forest is above 2.0 as against near to 1.0 in relatively undisturbed forest stands suggesting that the disturbance is intensive and thus natural recovery process would be slow. Socioeconomic analysis in villages located near the shola forest revealed the fact that the people depended heavily on this forest for their livelihood. Thus, the crux and the success of future management and conservation strategy depend on how one can reduce the dependency of people on the shola vegetation. Enrichment planting in disturbed parts of shola, enhancement of firewood by raising energy plantations, as well as development of lemongrass and firewood based agroforestry systems and reduction of grazing pressure by developing silvopastoral systems are the major strategies for the conservation of these shola forests.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity conservation requires prioritization of areas for in situ conservation. In that perspective, the present study documents the global diversity of a component of the soil macrofauna, the land planarians, and concerns an exploratory analysis of their possible role as indicators of biodiversity. Diversity is described by three quantitative methods: (1) hotspots of species richness, selecting areas richest in species, (2) hotspots of range-size rarity, identifying areas richest in narrowly endemic species, and (3) complementarity, prioritizing areas according to their greatest combined species richness. The biodiversity measures of species richness and range-size rarity show a great correspondence in the identification of hotspots of diversity; both measures identify the following seven areas as the most biodiverse for land planarians: Sao Paulo, Florianopolis, western Java, Tasmania, Sri Lanka, North Island/New Zealand, and Sydney. It is discussed to what extent the results for the land planarians correspond with those obtained in other studies that assessed biodiversity hotspots for taxa on a global scale. It is noteworthy that land planarians identify a few global hotspots of diversity that generally do not feature, or only have low rankings, in other studies: New Zealand, southeastern Australia, and Tasmania.'

Abstract: 'The present study deals with the discharge characteristics, major ion chemistry as well as particulate and dissolved sediment transport of the Bharathapuzha river flowing across the Western Ghats through the Palghat gap - a prominent break in the Western Ghats that acts as a climate corridor in the region. While the western part of the basin in Kerala exhibits a wetter/humid climate, the eastern part in Tamil Nadu experiences a semi-arid climate. This peculiar climatic condition together with human interventions has a decisive role on the discharge characteristics as well as catchment erosion of the river basin. The dissolved and particulate contents of the river waters were found to be directly related to the geo-environmental settings of the river catchments. An intercomparison of elemental loading in the river waters in different seasons reveals notable decrease in monsoon compared to nonmonsoon seasons, which is attributed mainly to dilution of the solute contents by monsoon precipitation. The bivariate plots of Na/(Na+Ca) vs Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and Cl/(Cl+HCO3) vs TDS spread generally in the rock dominance sector of Gibb\xe2\x80\x99s model indicating the role of chemical weathering in contributing to the major ion chemistry of the Bharathapuzha river. The intensity of weathering varied significantly among the different sub-basins of the Bharathapuzha river basin. The higher particulate load by dissolved load ratio of the Thuthapuzha and Gayathripuzha tributaries draining the humid areas compared to the Chitturpuzha tributary draining the semi-arid zones of the basin indicates the predominance of physical weathering in the former two sub-basins than the latter.'

Abstract: 'The present study assesses anthropogenic disturbances and their impacts on the vegetation in Western Himalaya, India on the basis of various disturbance parameters such as density, Total Basal Cover (TBC) of cut stumps, lopping percentage and grazing intensities. On the basis of canopy cover and frequency of disturbances (%), the studied forests were divided into highly disturbed (HD), moderately disturbed (MD) and least disturbed (LD) categories. The HD forests had the lowest canopy cover, lowest density and lowest TBC and the LD had the highest canopy cover, highest density and highest TBC. The MD forests occupied the intermediate position with respect to these parameters. Species richness was least in HD forests, highest in one of the MD forests while LD forest occupied an intermediate position. The percentage of regenerating species was lowest (54%) in HD and highest (72%) in MD. The density of seedlings and saplings was higher in one of the MD forests as compared to HD and LD. We concluded that the moderate disturbances do not affect the vegetation adversely; however the increased degree of disturbance causes loss in plant diversity; affects regeneration and changes community characteristics. Construction of hydroelectric projects at various places in the study area was found to be one of the most important sources of anthropogenic disturbances in addition to the routine anthropogenic disturbances like grazing, fuelwood collection and fodder extraction. If all proposed dams in the Indian Himalaya are constructed combined with weak national environmental impact assessment and implementation, it will result in a significant loss of species. Therefore, various agents of disturbances should be evaluated in cumulative manner and any developmental activities such as hydropower projects, which trigger various natural and anthropogenic disturbances, should be combined with proper cumulative environmental impact assessment and effective implementation to minimise the anticipated loss of vegetation.'

Abstract: 'Species composition, diversity and tree population structure were studied in three stands of the tropical wet evergreen forest in and around Namdapha National Park, Arunachal Pradesh, India. Three study stands exposed to different intensities of disturbances were identified, viz., undisturbed (2.4\xc2\xa0ha) in the core zone of the park, moderately disturbed (2.1\xc2\xa0ha) in the periphery of the park and highly disturbed (2.7\xc2\xa0ha) outside the park area. In total 200 plant species belonging to 73 families were recorded in three stands. Tree density and basal area showed a declining trend with the increase in disturbance intensity. The densities of tree saplings and seedlings were lower in the disturbed stands than in the undisturbed stand. Species like Altingia excelsa, Olea dioica, Terminalia chebula, Mesua ferrea and Shorea assamica in the undisturbed stand and Albizia procera alone in the moderately disturbed stand contributed more than 50% of the total tree density in respective stands. The undisturbed stand contained young tree population. In the highly disturbed stand, the tree density was scarce, but had uncut trees of higher girth class (>210\xc2\xa0cm GBH). Low shrub density was recorded in both disturbed stands due to frequent human disturbances; the broken canopy and direct sunlight enhanced the abundance of herbs in these stands. With a species rarity (species having <2 individuals) of ca. 50%, the tropical wet evergreenforests of the Namdapha National Park and its adjacent areas warrant more protection from human intervention and also eco-development to meet the livelihood requirements of the local inhabitants in the peripheral areas of the Namdapha National Park in order to reduce the anthropogenic pressure on the natural resources of the park.'

Abstract: 'Quantitative assessment of tree species diversity from sample plots in seven forest ranges of Nayagarh Forest Division in Odisha state in the Eastern Ghats of India was made during the period April, 2011 to November, 2013. A total of 120 transects (1000\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0m) were laid in Nayagarh, Odogaon, Pancharida, Khandapada, Dasapalla, Mahipur, and Gania forest ranges and tree stems of at least 30\xc2\xa0cm GBH were measured. The regeneration potential of trees was assessed from 5\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0m sample plots located within the main transect. A total of 177 tree species belonging to 120 genera and 44 families were recorded from the study area. Shorea robusta, Buchanania lanzan, Lannea coromandelica, Terminalia alata and Cleistanthus collinus were the predominant tree species. The stand density varied in the range of 355.33\xe2\x80\x93740.53\xc2\xa0stems\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 while basal area ranged from 7.77 to 31.62\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. The tree density and species richness decreased with increasing girth class. The highest number of species and maximum density was recorded in the girth class of 30\xe2\x80\x9360\xc2\xa0cm. The Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Weiner and Simpson Indices with respect to trees with \xe2\x89\xa530\xc2\xa0cm GBH varied in the range of 2.07\xe2\x80\x933.79\xc2\xa0cm and 0.03\xe2\x80\x930.37\xc2\xa0cm respectively and the values of diversity indices are within the reported range for tropical forests of Indian sub-continent. The families, Dipterocarpaceae, Anacardiaceae, Combretaceae and Euphorbiaceae contributed to maximum species richness, stand density, and basal area. Regeneration of many tree species was observed to be poor. The present study provides baseline data for further ecological studies, forest management, and formulation of site-specific strategies for conservation of biological diversity in moist deciduous forests of Eastern India.'

Abstract: 'Landscape ecology as a discipline in science is rather young. However its principles appear promising in outlining conservation strategies including a wide range of organisms, particularly birds. Birds due to their mobility use a variety of environmental resources, especially habitats. However, currently these habitats are only available in patches over most of the tropical world. Further whatever is left is under constant human pressure. This paper, therefore, addresses this problem and suggests means of dealing with it using the landscape approach as outlined by landscape ecology.'

Abstract: 'This special issue is dedicated to the in vitro tools and methods used to conserve the genetic diversity of rare and threatened plant species from around the world. Species that are on the brink of extinction because of the rapid loss of genetic diversity and habitat come mainly from resource-poor areas of the world and from global biodiversity hotspots and island countries. These species are unique because they are endemic, and only a few small populations or sometimes only a few individuals remain in the wild. Therefore, the challenges to support conservation by in vitro measures are many and varied. The editors of this invited issue solicited papers from experts from Asia, Africa, Europe, Australia, and North and South America. This compilation of articles describes the efforts in these diverse regions toward saving plants from extinction, and details the direct application of in vitro and cryopreservation methods. In addition, these contributions provide guidance on propagation of rare plants, including techniques for large-scale propagation, storage, and reintroduction. The in vitro techniques for conserving plant biodiversity include shoot apical or axillary-meristem-based micropropagation, somatic embryogenesis, cell culture technologies and embryo rescue techniques, as well as a range of in vitro cold storage and cryopreservation protocols, and they are discussed in depth in this issue.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity hotspots are used widely to designate priority regions for conservation efforts. It is unknown, however, whether the current network of hotspots adequately represents globally threatened taxonomic diversity for whole plant and animal groups. We used a mammalian group traditionally neglected in terms of conservation efforts, the rodents, in order to test whether biodiversity hotspots match the current distribution of threatened taxa (genera and species). Significantly higher numbers of threatened rodent genera and species fell within biodiversity hotspots; nonetheless over 25% of the total threatened genera and species did not occur in any biodiversity hotspot. This was particularly true for the Australian region, where 100% of the threatened genera and species fell outside biodiversity hotspots, with many threatened taxa found in Papua-New Guinea. We suggest to officially including Papua New Guinea among biodiversity hotspots for rodents, and also the steppic/semidesert areas of central Asia.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests have been recognized as having global conservation importance. However, they are being rapidly destroyed in many regions of the world. Regular monitoring of forests is necessary for an adaptive management approach and the successful implementation of ecosystem management. The present study analyses the temporal changes in forest ecosystem structure in tribal dominated Malkangiri district of Orissa, India, during 1973\xe2\x80\x932004 period based on digitized forest cover maps using geographic information system (GIS) and interpretation of satellite data. Three satellite images Landsat MSS (1973), Landsat TM (1990) and IRS P6 LISS III (2004) were used to determine changes. Six land cover types were delineated which includes dense forest, open forest, scrub land, agriculture, barren land and water body. Different forest types were also demarcated within forest class for better understanding the degradation pattern in each forest types. The results showed that there was a net decrease of 475.7 km2 forest cover (rate of deforestation = 2.34) from 1973 to 1990 and 402.3 km2 (rate of deforestation = 2.27) from 1990 to 2004. Forest cover has changed over time depending on a few factors such as large-scale deforestation, shifting cultivation, dam and road construction, unregulated management actions, and social pressure. A significant increase of 1222.8 km2 agriculture area (1973\xe2\x80\x932004) clearly indicated the conversion of forest cover to agricultural land. These alterations had resulted in significant environmental consequences, including decline in forest cover, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity. There is an urgent need for rational management of the remaining forest for it to be able to survive beyond next decades. Particular attention must be paid to tropical forests, which are rapidly being deforested.'

Abstract: 'There is still large uncertainty over the status of global forest cover owing to the paucity of comprehensive and holistic studies related to long term forest cover change. The aim of the present work is to prepare a nation-wide multi-date forest cover database which describes and quantifies historical and recent changes in natural forests of India. This analysis facilitated the determination of the state of Indian forest cover changes over last eight decades. Here, we have mapped the total area under forest cover, evaluated the spatial tracking of changes in natural forests, estimated the rate of deforestation and afforestation, analysed the biogeographic zone wise and state wise forest cover change, existing land use in deforested area, influence of environmental factors such as terrain on deforestation and implication of different definitions of forest used by agencies reporting deforestation in India. The results indicated that forests covered an area of 869,012\xc2\xa0km2 in 1930 which has decreased to 625,565\xc2\xa0km2 in 2013, a net loss of 243,447\xc2\xa0km2 (28\xc2\xa0%) in eight decades. The highest annual average forest loss was found to be 4795\xc2\xa0km2 during 1930\xe2\x80\x931975, 1476\xc2\xa0km2 during 1975\xe2\x80\x931985, 767\xc2\xa0km2 during 1985\xe2\x80\x931995, 356\xc2\xa0km2 during 1995\xe2\x80\x932005 and 209\xc2\xa0km2 during 2005\xe2\x80\x932013. Between 1930 and 1975, forest experienced large scale deforestation at gross annual rate of 0.77\xc2\xa0% which has declined to 0.29\xc2\xa0% and 0.14\xc2\xa0% for the 1975\xe2\x80\x931985 and 1985\xe2\x80\x931995 periods respectively. Quantification of annual rate of gross deforestation for the recent period indicates 0.07\xc2\xa0% during 1995\xe2\x80\x932005 and 0.05\xc2\xa0% during 2005\xe2\x80\x932013. The lower rates of deforestation during recent period support effectiveness of conservation measures taken at national level. It was found that deforestation rate has decreased in many biogeographic zones by 2005, except for Andaman & Nicobar Islands and North East. The major deforestation has mostly occurred due to conversion of forests to agriculture. The construction of reservoirs contributed to 4.1\xc2\xa0% of forest loss. The tropical forests have experienced large scale deforestation followed by subtropical forests. The findings of the study will be useful to prioritize conservation and protection of forest cover at the regional level. It shall also provide a base for future research on the impacts of deforestation on carbon flux and biodiversity.'

Title: 'A framework for considering ecological interactions for common non-timber forest product species: a case study of mountain date palm (Phoenix loureiroi Kunth) leaf harvest in South India'

Abstract: 'Many economically important non-timber forest products (NTFPs) come from widespread and common plant species. Harvest of these species often is assumed to be sustainable due to their commonness. However, because of the ecological roles of common species, harvest may affect and be affected by ecological interactions at broader scales, which are rarely considered when evaluating the sustainability of harvest. We use a case study of the mountain date palm (Phoenix loureiroi Kunth), harvested in South India to produce brooms, to present a conceptual framework illustrating how intensive harvest of a common species interacts with other anthropogenic management practices, plant-animal interactions and surrounding environmental conditions.'

Abstract: 'The members of the genus Muntiacus are of particular interest to evolutionary biologists due to their extreme chromosomal rearrangements and the ongoing discussions about the number of living species. Red muntjacs have the largest distribution of all muntjacs and were formerly considered as one species. Karyotype differences led to the provisional split between the Southern Red Muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak) and the Northern Red Muntjac (M. vaginalis), but uncertainties remain as, so far, no phylogenetic study has been conducted. Here, we analysed whole mitochondrial genomes of 59 archival and 16 contemporaneous samples to resolve uncertainties about their taxonomy and used red muntjacs as model for understanding the evolutionary history of other species in Southeast Asia.'

Abstract: 'Watersheds from semiarid regions are more sensitive to hydrological processes and sustainability of water resources than humid regions. Hence, it is indispensable to determine the response of watersheds to hydrological processes for water resource management. Thus, the hydrological response-based watershed prioritization study has been undertaken for eight sub-watersheds from semiarid, basaltic region of Western Ghats of India. Intent to this, a novel index has been parameterized using thematic layers such as drainage density, geology, soil, slope, landform classification, land use/land cover, rainfall and runoff (DGSLR). This study evaluates the performance of DGSLR index using three models, namely analytical hierarchy process (AHP), frequency ratio (FR) and fuzzy logic for sub-watershed-wise prioritization. The FR ratio showed the highest value for very high drainage density (8.73) indicating most probability for a high hydrological response. According to AHP weight, most influencing factors to hydrological processes are precipitation (25%), slope (19%) and land use/land cover (14%) followed by landform classification (11%). These three methods\xc2\xa0are prioritized\xc2\xa0study area into four classes, i.e., very high, high, moderate and low using area-weighted average method. These models showed that very high-priority area lies near the outlet of the watershed as well as the upper part of the watershed in high to very high priority in all three models. It covers 33.12% of the total area having a high average slope with high drainage density in sub-watersheds 1, 3, 7 and 8. The predictive capability of DGSLR index was computed by the area under the curve (AUC) and receiver operating characteristic\xc2\xa0(ROC) method, revealed average accuracy for FR method (AUC\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa089%) better than AHP method (AUC\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa077%) and fuzzy logic (AUC\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa076%). This novel index could be used by the water resources researchers and planners in any terrain to understand the hydrological response.'

Abstract: 'Pill-millipedes of the genus Arthrosphaera (Sphaerotheriidae) has restricted geographic distribution (Southern India, Sri Lanka and Madagascar) were under studied category of soil macrofauna. In the current study, seven morphospecies of Arthrosphaera were recovered in four biomes of the Western Ghats and west coast of India. In locations Makutta (A. fumosa), Karike (A. fumosa), Ninthikal (A. dalyi), Uppinangadi (A. magna) and Uppala (A. hendersoni) were endowed with only one species of Arthrosphaera. Although some locations consist of more than one species, one of them was dominated. Shankaraghatta forest consists of A. disticta and A. versicolor, but A. disticta was highly dominant. In Adyanadka plantations, A. magna was dominant than A. carinata. The highest number of A. disticta was recorded per quadrate in high-altitude location (Shimoga), followed by A. hendersoni in the coastal location (Uppala), A. magna (Adyanadka) and A. dalyi (Ninthikal) in foothill locations. The highest biomass of A. dalyi per quadrate was seen in Ninthikal, followed by A. magna in Adyanadka, A. disticta in Shimoga, A. fumosa in Karike and A. magna in Adyanadka and Uppinangadi. The richness of Arthrosphaera was positively correlated with biomass, conductivity, total nitrogen, potassium contents in soil and negatively correlated with calcium content in soil.'

Abstract: 'Aglaia bourdillonii is a plant narrowly endemic to the southern portion of the Western Ghats (WG), in peninsular India. To understand its ecological and geographic distribution, we used ecological niche modeling (ENM) based on detailed distributional information recently gathered, in relation to detailed climatic data sets. The ENMs successfully reconstructed key features of the species\xe2\x80\x99 geographic distribution, focusing almost entirely on the southern WG. Much of the species\xe2\x80\x99 distributional potential is already under protection, but our analysis allows identification of key zones for additional protection, all of which are adjacent to existing protected areas. ENM provides a useful tool for understanding the natural history of such rare and endangered species.'

Abstract: "Reducing carbon Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) is of central importance to combat climate change. Foremost among the challenges is quantifying nation's carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation, which requires information on forest carbon storage. Here we estimated carbon storage in India's forest biomass for the years 2003, 2005 and 2007 and the net flux caused by deforestation and degradation, between two assessment periods i.e., Assessment Period first (ASP I), 2003-2005 and Assessment Period second (ASP II), 2005-2007."

Abstract: 'Soil erosion induces land degradation and minimizes the water-holding capacity, resulting in poor environmental quality at a basin scale. This becomes more serious due to long-term anthropogenic pressure including over exploitation of natural resources and lack of sustainable development. In this study, an automated RUSLE-SY model was developed to identify the potential soil erosion and sediment yield zones in Tamiraparani sub-basin, South India. The input parameters required to execute the RUSLE-SY model are digital elevation model, study area boundary, land-use/land-cover data, soil data, annual rainfall data, near-infrared and red bands from satellite imagery. The entire set of data was geoprocessed with standard RUSLE and sediment yield equations for generating soil erosion and sediment yield map. The distribution of soil erosion and sediment yield in the study area was analyzed, and its impacts were discussed. The result reveals that the high soil erosion is noticed in the western part of the sub-basin (31.25\xc2\xa0ton\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921). Moreover, the sediment yield in this area contributes around 14.54\xc2\xa0ton\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921. The low level of soil erosion and sediment yield (~95\xc2\xa0% of the area) reflects the climatic variability and topography of Tamiraparani sub-basin. The resulting RUSLE-SY model provides a robust and easy to use soil erosion and conservation management tool for efficient planning in similar environments.'

Abstract: 'The Western Ghats of India, one of the global biodiversity hotspots and freshwater eco-regions, harbors several fish species which not just form the important part of the world\xe2\x80\x99s freshwater biodiversity yet in addition are the vital segment of livelihood of the neighborhood population. The rate of fish decline in the Western Ghats is alarming. The absence of organized study and data scarcity on basic biology and life history traits of several species could be one reason behind the decline, and thus it is difficult to execute conservation action/s. This is especially true, particularly for data-deficient species for which definite data related to distribution, population size, and trend is not available.

Abstract: ' Rhododendron arboreum of the family Ericaceae represents one of the ancient relict tree species of the genus showing extreme disjunction in the Indian subcontinent. It is represented by two sub-species viz., ssp. arboreum Smith in the forests of north-eastern India (temperate) and spp. nilagiricum (Zenker) Tagg distributed in the southern Western Ghats (tropical) of India with apparently no distribution in the intervening plains. 35 Samples corresponding to different locations in the tropical montane forests of Nilgiris and temperate forests of northeast India were analyzed for distribution of genetic variation using 25 random primers. Relatively high genetic diversity was measured in the temperate populations (Ht = 0.21; Nm = 1.13) than tropical Rhododendrons. The hierarchical analysis of molecular variance showed that among the total variance, 25% is residing within populations while 63% of variance is among regions apparently revealing that disjunct distribution has structured genetic differentiation pattern in this species. Grouping of samples was in conformity with their spatial distribution, which was confirmed by UPGMA cluster analysis and PCA scatter plot. The taxon with its unique distribution pattern and wide cross compatibility between sub-species is however threatened by low genetic variation and gene flow that catalyses it\xe2\x80\x99s shifting towards genetic drift and hence long-term conservation strategies need to be formulated particularly for the tropical Rhododendron sub-species. Among the various hypotheses and theory proposed to explain the Malayan affinity in the flora and fauna of Western Ghats, Satpura hypothesis based on dispersal model of distribution largely explains the discontinues distribution of R. arboreum.'

Abstract: 'Genetic variation, haplotype relationships, and potential regions of diversity in Symplocos laurina Wall. (Symplocaceae), a montane tree species from India, have been tested using molecular and biogeographical data to infer phylogeographic patterns. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique was used to determine the chloroplast (cp) and mitochondrial (mt) DNA haplotypes of 218 individuals from 12 populations, collected from Northeast India (NEI), which is a part of Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot, and South India, which includes the Western Ghats (WG), another biodiversity hotspot from India and Eastern Ghats (EG). Nine cpDNA (chlorotypes) and 24 mtDNA haplotypes (mitotypes) were identified; the WG region was identified as the most diverse for chlorotypes and the NEI region for mitotypes. Although a strong population differentiation was observed, phylogeographic structure was found to be absent for both the genomes. The haplotype network revealed the presence of two main lineages: NEI-WG lineage and EG lineage, largely without overlapping distributions. The study tests two hypotheses, namely vicariance and dispersal, to understand the distribution of plants in India. The population structure of S. laurina strongly suggests the persistence of the species in putative refugial areas preglaciation and further establishment of other populations of S. laurina from these refugial populations.'

Abstract: 'We assessed the diversity of woody plants at 15 forested sites in the Tansa Valley of Thane District, in Maharashtra, India. The fewest species (11) were seen at a degraded mangrove site near the river mouth, and the greatest number (150) in the rich semi-evergreen forest on Tungar Hill. For all sites there were 141 tree, 25 shrub and 15 liana species, a total of 181 species. Excluding the mangrove site, which had no species in common with the other 14 sites, we analyzed the species distributions in detail. These sites ranged in area from 4 to 30 km2 each, had woody floras of 89 \xc2\xb1 6 species, and varied in intensity of human impact. Despite a history of exploitation and substantial reduction in biomass from firewood collecting, set fires and illicit tree felling, considerable plant diversity remains in the area. We found a modest increase in species richness in transects away from two villages. We observed the exploitation of the forest by the principal users, primarily of the Warli Tribe. They exploited a wide variety of forest resources (92 species), for medicines, foods, construction materials, household goods, manure and other purposes. They collected 15 items for sale. By far the single most important item collected was firewood, which dramatically reduced forest biomass within 2 km of villages. The species distributions in these forest remnants are strongly nested, mostly due to varying degrees of disturbance at individual sites. The high species diversity on Tungar Hill is most likely a relict of the earlier character of forests throughout much of the valley. It merits the highest priorities for preservation, as a refuge for Western Ghat species at the northern limits of their distributions.'

Abstract: 'I studied ecomorphological correlations in 18 stream fish species (belonging to five families) commonly occurring in diversity rich habitats of rivers in the central Western Ghats (Southern India). Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated a clear segregation of species in morphological and ecological (habitat) space. Cluster analyses using morphological features segregated species based mainly on their body shape and feeding parameters while habitat parameters segregated species according to their position along the water column and preference to runs or pool habitats. Principal component analyses showed that body size, head dimensions, mouth position and eye diameter were important characters for species segregation in morphological space while run or pool habitat type and the position of the fish in the water column best explained segregation of species in habitat space. Consistencies in some of the species clusters obtained from analyses on morphological characteristics and habitat preferences warrant closer examination of the relationships between them. These were studied employing multivariate methods like canonical correspondence analysis and the Mantel test. The tests revealed weak correlations indicating that in addition to morphology, other factors like behavioural, physiological and evolutionary constraints together are likely to play an important role in ecosystem structuring of these complex tropical assemblages.'

Abstract: 'Liana diversity was inventoried in four tropical dry evergreen forest sites that are characterized by numerous trees, of short stature and small diameter, and a varying degree of anthropogenic disturbance, on the Coromandel coast of south India. A 1-ha plot was established in each of the four sites and was subdivided into 100 quadrats of 10 m\xc3\x97 10 m. All lianas \xe2\x89\xa51 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) rooted within the plot were enumerated. The species richness and density of lianas, with respect to site disturbance and forest stature, varied across the sites. Liana density totaled 3307 individuals (range 497\xe2\x80\x931163 individuals ha\xe2\x88\x921) and species richness totaled 39 species (range 24\xe2\x80\x9329 species ha\xe2\x88\x921) representing 34 genera and 24 families. Combretaceae, Asclepiadaceae, Capparaceae and Vitaceae were the well-represented families. The top five species Strychnos minor, Combretum albidum, Derris ovalifolia, Jasminum angustifolium and Reissantia indica contributed 55% of total density. The slopes of the species\xe2\x80\x93area curves were different for each of the four sites and the curve stabilized in only one site. Of the four climbing modes recognized among the total 39 species, 18 were twiners (56% of the total density). Eight species (24% of density) were tendril climbers and 12 species (16% of density) were scramblers. Hugonia mystax was the only hook climber. All the 39 species and 88% of liana density were encountered within a category of 6 cm dbh or less, and a similar pattern prevailed in the individual sites. Of the three diaspore dispersal modes found among the 39 liana species, animal (64%) and wind (23%) dispersal were predominant over the autochorous mode (13%). Liana diversity and distribution in dry forest communities appear to be influenced by forest stature and site disturbance levels. In the light of the extent of liana diversity and sacred grove status of the study sites, the need for forest conservation, involving local people, is emphasized.'

Abstract: 'Due to large scale afforestation programs and forest conservation legislations, India\xe2\x80\x99s total forest area seems to have stabilized or even increased. In spite of such efforts, forest fragmentation and degradation continues, with forests being subject to increased pressure due to anthropogenic factors. Such fragmentation and degradation is leading to the forest cover to change from very dense to moderately dense and open forest and 253\xc2\xa0km2 of very dense forest has been converted to moderately dense forest, open forest, scrub and non-forest (during 2005\xe2\x80\x932007). Similarly, there has been a degradation of 4,120\xc2\xa0km2 of moderately dense forest to open forest, scrub and non-forest resulting in a net loss of 936\xc2\xa0km2 of moderately dense forest. Additionally, 4,335\xc2\xa0km2 of open forest have degraded to scrub and non-forest. Coupled with pressure due to anthropogenic factors, climate change is likely to be an added stress on forests. Forest sector programs and policies are major factors that determine the status of forests and potentially resilience to projected impacts of climate change. An attempt is made to review the forest policies and programs and their implications for the status of forests and for vulnerability of forests to projected climate change. The study concludes that forest conservation and development policies and programs need to be oriented to incorporate climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation.'

Abstract: ' Corallodiscus lanuginosus is distributed 12,000\xc2\xa0km across its northeast\xe2\x80\x93southwest boundaries, showing its highest morphological diversity in the Hengduan Mountains, Southwest China. We investigated the mechanisms behind the high diversity in this species. We acquired ITS sequence data across the distribution range of the genus, reconstructed dated phylogenies, projected the resulting clades onto geographic maps and linked the results with inferred ploidy levels of the populations. We found strong geographic patterns for the ITS clades but with extensively overlapping ranges, particularly in the Hengduan Mountains area. We deduced an origin of C. lanuginosus in the mid-Oligocene. We used the presence of ITS polymorphisms to infer a high level of hybridization events mainly in areas of clade overlap, where we also inferred repeated tetraploidization events to have taken place. Pre- and post-Quaternary climate oscillation-driven expansions and contractions of distribution ranges have allowed secondary contacts, hybridization and introgression that shaped the current patchy distribution of morphological diversity in the species. Polyploidization as a reinforcing genetic barrier added to the genetic diversity in space and time particularly in the Hengduan Mountains.'

Abstract: 'Seventeen mangrove species of eight families at seven riverine and fringe habitats in Goa West India were surveyed for Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) fungal diversity. Sixteen species were found to be mycorrhizal and one species showed no AM fungal colonization. AM root colonization was recorded at all seven sites and ranged from 6%\xe2\x80\x9377%. Maximum root colonization was recorded in Excoecaria agallocha (77%) and minimum colonization in Avicennia marina (6%). Paris-type colonization was predominant at all sites. Auxiliary cells were recorded in roots of Acanthus ilicifolius, Ceriops tagal and Sonneretia alba. AM fungal root colonization and spore density varied by plant species and site. Site average spore density ranged from 1.84 spores\xc2\xb7g\xe2\x88\x921 to 0.54 spores\xc2\xb7g\xe2\x88\x921 of soil. In total, 28 AM fungal species of five genera, viz. Glomus, Acaulospora, Scutellospora, Gigaspora and Entrophospora, were recovered. Glomus was the dominant genus, three species of which were sporocarpic forms. Maximum site species richness (SR) ranged from 16 to 5. Species richness was maximum in A. ilicifolius where seven species of three genera were recovered. Based on relative abundance (RA) and isolation frequency (IF), two common species, viz. G. intraradices and A. laevis, were recovered from all seven sites.'

Abstract: 'In an age of Anthropocene, the urban landscapes are recognised as the \xe2\x80\x98hotspots\xe2\x80\x99 of human-mediated alien species introductions. As the cities provide an ideal natural experimental system to investigate the patterns of alien plant diversity in urban landscapes, the present study aimed to unravel the taxonomic, biogeographic and ecological patterns of alien flora of Srinagar\xe2\x80\x94one of the largest urban centres in the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. The alien flora of Srinagar comprises 325 species, constituting ca.35% of total flora of the city. Out of the 325 alien species documented, 157 species (43%) were recorded to be under cultivation, while 168 species (57%) were growing in the wild (i.e., outside cultivation); those growing in the wild, in turn, comprised 110 cultivation escapes and 58 accidentally introduced plant species. Biogeographically, two-third of the alien plant diversity reported from Srinagar is native to Asia-Temperate. This indicates that climatic similarity between Asia-Temperate and Kashmir Himalayas facilitate in flourishing similar floristic diversity. The study highlights a relatively higher proportion of herbaceous growth form in the aliens growing in the wild (80%) than those under cultivation (43%). Similarly, 82% of the alien species under cultivation had a perennial life span, but those growing in the wild were dominated by annuals (44%). Currently, 45 species are growing as casuals and 124 species are naturalised (including 105 naturalised non-invasive and 19 naturalised invasive). Along the continuum of casual-naturalised-invasive categories, the contribution of cultivation escapes and accidently introduced aliens contrastingly shows decreasing and increasing trends respectively. Interestingly, the results revealed that the human practice of stopping cultivation of alien escapes increased rapidly as we move along the continuum. Thus, the present study has investigated the patterns of alien plant diversity in the urban landscape of Srinagar, and the results obtained offer scientific insights toward better scientific understanding and management of plant invasions in this Himalayan city, with wider policy implications for neighbouring urbanised landscapes in the Himalayas and other mountainous regions across the world.'

Abstract: 'The process of forest fragmentation, a common phenomenon occurring in tropical forests, not only results into continuously forest getting fragmented but also brings about several physical and biological changes in the environment of forests. Consequently, there is a loss of biodiversity due to change in habitat conditions. These remnant fragments provide the last hope for biodiversity conservation. The present study deals with the impact of decreasing patch size of a fragmented forest on the diversity of the tropical dry deciduous forests in Vindhyan highlands, India. There is considerable change in the vegetation cover of this region owing to rapid industrialization and urbanization, which has also contributed to forest fragmentation. In the present study, remotely sensed data has been used to describe the changes brought about in vegetated areas over a period of 10\xc2\xa0years as a result of fragmentation and its impact on biodiversity was assessed. Further, in order to assess the loss of species with respect to the reduction in patch size, species area curves for various change areas were analysed. It was observed that the rate of decrease in the number of species is faster in the case of negative change areas as compared to the positive change areas of the region. Various diversity indices also support this observation. Such an analysis would help in formulating appropriate conservation measures for the region.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity is a key to human well-being. However universally acknowledged, this reality is not appreciated as much as one might imagine or hope. Having achieved a high standing in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 1992, biodiversity appears to have gradually fallen from that position in the 20 years since. This is evidenced by the fact that most discussions and actions in relation to the CBD have now shifted to sustainable development and ecosystem services (Daily 1997), instead of focusing more directly on biodiversity values themselves. One reason for this fall in status seems to be linked to issues about the actual definition of \xe2\x80\x98biodiversity\xe2\x80\x99, whether used in a broad sense, including the diversity of genes, species, communities and ecosystems, or more narrowly defined as the diversity of species alone. While the close link between biodiversity and \xe2\x80\x98ecosystem services\xe2\x80\x99 is undeniable, biodiversity itself has long recognized links to human well-being, including...'

Abstract: 'Land use is a main driver of global biodiversity loss and its environmental relevance is widely recognized in research on life cycle assessment (LCA). The inherent spatial heterogeneity of biodiversity and its non-uniform response to land use requires a regionalized assessment, whereas many LCA applications with globally distributed value chains require a global scale. This paper presents a first approach to quantify land use impacts on biodiversity across different world regions and highlights uncertainties and research needs.'

Abstract: 'The last four decades have seen an increasing integration of phylogenetics and biogeography. However, a dearth of phylogenetic studies has precluded such biogeographic analyses in South Asia until recently. Noting the increase in phylogenetic research and interest in phylogenetic biogeography in the region, we outline an integrative framework for studying taxon distribution patterns. While doing so, we pay particular attention to challenges posed by the complex geological and ecological history of the region, and the differences in distribution across taxonomic groups. We outline and compare three widely used phylogenetic biogeographic approaches: topology-based methods (TBMs), pattern-based methods (PBMs) and event-based methods (EBMs). TBMs lack a quantitative framework and utilize only part of the available phylogenetic information. Hence, they are mainly suited for preliminary enquiries. Both PBMs and EBMs have a quantitative framework, but we consider the latter to be particularly suited to the South Asian context since they consider multiple biogeographic processes explicitly, and can accommodate a reticulated history of areas. As an illustration, we present a biogeographic analysis of endemic Sri Lankan agamid lizards. The results provide insights into the relative importance of multiple processes and specific zones in the radiation of two speciose lizard clades.'

Abstract: 'The plant\xe2\x80\x93disperser relationship and its key predictors in Indian tropical archipelagos are understudied. East of the Indian mainland (the Eastern coast, EC) are the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (AN, about 1221\xc2\xa0km away at the shortest distance), which exhibit a great plant diversity, with 848 unique species. West of the Indian mainland (the Western Ghats, WG) are another group of islands, the Lakshadweep Islands (LD, about 320\xc2\xa0km away at the shortest distance), which exhibit less diversity (102 unique species) than do the AN. We compared these two mainland\xe2\x80\x93island pairs (EC\xe2\x80\x93AN, WG\xe2\x80\x93LD), which exhibit different insular isolation conditions, to understand the plant dispersal mechanisms and their determining predictors (plant richness, geographic area, perimeter, elevation, and shortest distance). We found epizoochory (adherence to an animal surface), ornithochory (birds), and hydrochory (water) to be the dominant dispersers of both the pairs. Additionally, the plant dispersal in the WG\xe2\x80\x93LD pair is predominantly driven by anemochory (wind), possibly denoting the effects of the northeasterly trade winds. The major role of biotic dispersers in the EC\xe2\x80\x93AN pair may be explained as resulting from plant dispersal to more remote islands through biotic dispersers being more rapid and efficient. The plant commonality was found to be positively correlated with the plant richness, geographic area, and perimeter; whereas it was negatively correlated with the shortest distance and elevation of the selected mainland\xe2\x80\x93island pairs. Both linear (R2\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.85) and non-linear (R2\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.95) regression with maximum accuracy found island plant richness, geographic area, and shortest distance to the nearest mainland pool to be the determinants in explaining plant-dispersal mechanisms. These predictors are important to maintain the habitat suitability and connectivity and thereby support more newly dispersed plants. The plant\xe2\x80\x93disperser relationship (epizoochory, ornithochory, anemochory, and hydrochory) and the key predictors (plant richness, geographic area, and shortest distance) found in this study could be useful for conservation, planning, and monitoring of biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Genetic diversity and relationship among three genera namely Drimia, Dipcadi and Ledebouria of Hyacinthaceae in India was studied using RAPD and SRAP markers. Twenty one RAPD primers and nine SRAP were used for analyzing 41 accessions. RAPD gave an average 12.6 markers per primer, while SRAP generated 10.1 markers per primer pair. The family emerged very diverged with high polymorphism. The study resolved the three genera into monophyletic groups corresponding to three subfamilies; Urginoideae, Hyacinthoideae and Ornithogaloideae. Drimia wightii emerged a very distinct species and species specific markers were obtained with both marker systems. AMOVA analysis also revealed the genera to be quite well diverged. The two markers showed high correlation (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.932) in Mantel matrix crresspondance test. The combined data also showed a very good correlation with the respective markers individually.'

Abstract: "Mount Kawa Karpo of the Menri ('Medicine Mountains' in Tibetan), in the eastern Himalayas, is one of the most sacred mountains to Tibetan Buddhists. Numerous sacred sites are found between 1900 and 4000\xc2\xa0m, and at higher elevations the area as a whole is considered a sacred landscape. Religious beliefs may affect the ecology of these sacred areas, resulting in unique ecological characteristics of importance to conservation; recent studies have demonstrated that sacred areas can often play a major role in conservation. The goal of this study is to preliminarily analyze the vegetation of sacred areas in the Menri region using existing vegetation maps and a Geographical Information System (GIS) for remote assessment. Sacred sites are compared to random points in the landscape, in terms of: elevation, vegetation, and nearness to villages; species composition, diversity, and richness; and frequency of useful and endemic plant species. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) ordination reveals that sacred sites differ significantly in both useful species composition (p=0.034) and endemic species composition (p=0.045). Sacred sites are located at lower elevations, and closer to villages, than randomly selected, non-sacred sites (p<\xc2\xa00.0001), and have higher overall species richness (p=0.033) and diversity (p=0.042). In addition, the high-elevation (>\xc2\xa04000\xc2\xa0m) areas of the mountain - a sacred landscape - are found to have significantly more endemics than low-elevation areas (p<0.0001). These findings represent an initial analysis of sacred sites and suggest that sacred sites in the Menri region may be ecologically and ethnobotanically unique."

Arg., Swietenia macrophylla King. and Tectona grandis L. were collected from different locations of Madhupur forest area to study the biodiversity of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) fungal colonization and spore population. All the plants showed AM colonization. Out of eight selected plants, mycelial colonization was lowest in the roots of A. heterophyllus (22%) and the highest was in the roots of H. brasiliensis (78%). Mycelial intensity was observed poor (25%\xe2\x80\x9377%) and moderate (23%\xe2\x80\x9357%) in all plants species and abundant (11%\xe2\x80\x9340%) was in most of the plant species. Vesicular colonization was observed in five plant species. The lowest was recorded in E. camaldulensis (4%) and the highest was in H. brasiliensis (21%). Poor (24%\xe2\x80\x9356%), moderate (16%\xe2\x80\x93100%) and abundant (11%\xe2\x80\x9340%) type of vesicular intensity were observed. Arbuscular colonization was observed in three plants. The highest was in A. mangium (72%) and the lowest was in S. macrophylla (17%). Arbuscular intensity was recorded as poor (12%\xe2\x80\x9344%), moderate (22%\xe2\x80\x93100%) and abundant (4%\xe2\x80\x9347%). The highest AM fungal spore population was in A. auriculiformis (714) and the lowest was in D. sissoo (102). Five AM fungal genera were recorded. Glomus was found to be dominant. A few spores remained unidentified. Significant correlation was observed between percent colonization and spore population. The results of the present study indicate the occurrence of AM fungi and the mycotrophism of the plants of Madhupur forest area and the applicability of AM technology in the forest management of Madhupur forest.'

Abstract: 'The people of Manipur, a state in northeast India, follow ancestral worship and animism in the form of deity worship, with the central focus on worship in forest patches. The beliefs and taboos associated with the Sylvan deities (Umanglais) in the forest patches are restricted to any sort of disturbance of flora and fauna. These social boundaries help to conserve the entire organism as a whole, which stand the concept of sacred groves. The pleasing of deities is performed every year by the Meiteis, a dominant community of Manipur, in honour of the deities and to gain their favour. Indigenous cultural and rituals practices of the local people in sacred groves serve as a tool for conserving biodiversity. Sacred groves are distributed over a wide ecosystem and help in conservation of rare and endemic species. Well-preserved sacred groves are store houses of valuable medicinal and other plants having high economic value, and serve as a refuge to threatened species. One hundred and sixty-six sacred groves were inventoried in Manipur valley that comprises Imphal east, Imphal west, Thoubal and Bishnupur districts of the state. Detailed studies were carried out in four selected sacred groves, to know the importance of biodiversity status and vegetation characteristics. A total of 173 plant species representing 145 genera under 70 families were recorded through baseline floristic survey. The species diversity indices were compared among the four studied groves. The vegetation composition and community characteristics were recorded. Ethnobotanical uses of species were examined, which reveal that 96% of the species were used as medicine for the treatment of various ailments. Utilization of herbal medicine by the Meiteis is closely related to the cultural and ritual practices. A few of the medicinal plants which have disappeared from the locality are now confined only to the groves. Socio-cultural aspects were investigated taking into account the attitudes of local people, which indicate social beliefs and taboo are eroding, simultaneously degrading the degree of protection of sacred groves. Therefore, conservation measures of sacred groves need to be formulated considering the factor of degradation and the basic necessities of the local people. Until and unless a viable option is provided to the local people (especially those who habitat nearby the adjoining areas) for sustaining their economic condition, no step for conservation of biodiversity will be successful.'

Abstract: 'Remote sensing, a state of art technology has gained significance due to its capability to map and monitor compositional, structural and functional biodiversity. Remote sensing data provides a perspective on how ecosystems and species are being affected by the multiple disturbances. This paper presents consolidated information of earth observation based biodiversity research and conservation applications in India. Progress achieved for understanding essential biodiversity variables with reference to species populations, species traits, community composition, ecosystem function and ecosystem structure have been reviewed. Studies mostly focused on remote sensing based biodiversity indicators in understanding of land cover, forest cover, forest type, fragmentation, biological richness, carbon stocks, fires and protected area monitoring at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Fine resolution understanding with reference to vegetation structure, function, distribution of threatened, endemic and invasive species is required for effective conservation strategies. The declining trend of deforestation and effectiveness of protected area network indicates India\xe2\x80\x99s commitment towards the global conservation targets. Ensured continuity of remote sensing can support in near real monitoring of habitats and achieving conservation effectiveness.'

Abstract: 'Fungal endophytes were isolated from inner bark of Taxus baccata L., an important source of potent anticancer drug taxol. Bark samples were collected from two locations of Arunachal Pradesh, India, part of the Indo-Burma mega biodiversity hotspot, during two seasons i.e. monsoon and winter. Altogether 77 fungal strains representing 18 genera were isolated from T. baccata bark during the present investigation. The colonizing frequency was recorded as 38.5% and the fungal community comprised of 78% of Hyphomycetes, 5.2% of Coelomycetes, 2.6% of Zygomycetes and Ascomycetes and 9.1% of sterile mycelia. Most common and frequently isolated genera were Fusarium, Penicillium and Aspergillus. Simpson and Shannon diversity indices indicated higher species diversity during monsoon than during winter seasons irrespective of the locations. The two locations harbored 5 to 37 endophyte species and the similarity index was low during winter and high during monsoon. Ethyl acetate extract of fermentation cultures of these fungi were tested for their antimicrobial activity against a panel of human pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Fifteen fungal isolates out of the isolated strains displayed antimicrobial activity. An endophytic fungus, identified as Fusarium sp. displayed significant antimicrobial activity against all the test pathogens.'

Abstract: 'Aerobic methanotrophs associated with Indian rice plants have rarely been cultivated. In the present study, we cultured aerobic methanotrophic bacteria from the rhizosphere regions of rice plants. Rhizospheric soils from seven rice landraces traditionally grown and maintained by tribal people in Jawhar region belonging to part of the Western Ghats in India, were used. Seven methanotrophic cultures were isolated from the last positive dilution (10\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x894). Methanotrophs were identified by analyzing the partial methane monooxygenase gene, pmoA gene and three of these belonged to the genus Methylocaldum (gammaproteobacterial, Type I methanotrophs) and four belonged to the genus Methylocystis (alphaproteobacterial, Type II methanotrophs). We present here the first report on the cultivation of methanotrophs from Indian traditional rice landraces originating from a biodiversity hotspot.'

Abstract: 'The endemic giant pill-millipedes belonging to the genus Arthrosphaera has a long history of occurrence and distribution in the Indian Subcontinent. According to the earlier and recent records, up to 40 species of Arthrosphaera are confined to southern India and Sri Lanka. Being detritus feeders, they are sensitive to narrow range of abiotic factors and their population is dwindling due to severe human interference especially landscape modification or modern forestry/agricultural practices. There is an urgent need to update the status, occurrence and distribution in distinct ecological conditions of pill-millipedes in southern India as they are important component in organic matter decomposition as well as nutrient turn over in the forests or plantations. Based on recent surveys, the present study attempts to update occurrence, distribution and morphological description (light and scanning electron microscopy) with a diagnostic key for identification of 11 species of pill-millipedes occurring in the Western Ghats of India with commentary on their distribution pattern in different ecological conditions and impact of edaphic factors.'

Abstract: 'Pachmarhi biosphere reserve (PBR) encompasses 3 biodiversity conservation units viz. Pachmarhi Sanctuary, Satpura National Park and Bori Sanctuary, extending to an area of 4987.38\xc2\xa0square km. PBR has been recognized as one of the 26 endemic centers of the country and therefore the diversity of flora at the region holds much significance. The bryophyte diversity of PBR has been a matter of consideration by workers over several decades. The present work describes 13 epiphytes belonging to 9 families and 11 genera among which 5 taxa viz. Platygyriella aurea (Schwaegr.) Buck, Leucoloma amoene\xe2\x80\x94virens Mitt., Meiothecium microcarpum (Hook.) Mitt., Leucobryum juniperoideum (Brid.) C. Muell. and Entodontopsis setschwanica (Broth.) Buck & Ireland are new to PBR. Stereophyllaceae, Hypnaceae and Dicranaceae emerged as relatively frequent families and Entodontopsis nitens and Entodontopsis leucostega as the dominant taxa. Epiphytic flora of a region accounts for ecological and environmental importance therefore, unveiling of epiphytic moss flora of PBR will undoubtedly aid in further studies on biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Forests are subjected to stress from climatic and non-climatic sources. In this study, we have reported the results of inherent, as well as climate change driven vulnerability assessments for Indian forests. To assess inherent vulnerability of forests under current climate, we have used four indicators, namely biological richness, disturbance index, canopy cover, and slope. The assessment is presented as spatial profile of inherent vulnerability in low, medium, high and very high vulnerability classes. Fourty percent forest grid points in India show high or very high inherent vulnerability. Plantation forests show higher inherent vulnerability than natural forests. We assess the climate change driven vulnerability by combining the results of inherent vulnerability assessment with the climate change impact projections simulated by the Integrated Biosphere Simulator dynamic global vegetation model. While 46% forest grid points show high, very high, or extremely high vulnerability under future climate in the short term (2030s) under both representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5, such grid points are 49 and 54%, respectively, in the long term (2080s). Generally, forests in the higher rainfall zones show lower vulnerability as compared to drier forests under future climate. Minimizing anthropogenic disturbance and conserving biodiversity can potentially reduce forest vulnerability under climate change. For disturbed forests and plantations, adaptive management aimed at forest restoration is necessary to build long-term resilience.'

Abstract: 'Twenty soil communities from the northeastern forests (Assam) and the Western Ghats (Maharashtra) were screened for the presence of the lysine aminotransferase (lat) gene fromNocardia. Hybridization probes and primers were synthesized in accordance with the reported sequence of theNocardia lat gene from GenBank (number: G1 49355). Seven positives were obtained from the 20 soils. Six of the seven positive were from the Western Ghats and one from the northeast Assam forests. Eighteen actinomycete isolates from the 7 positive soils showed the presence of thelat gene. Only 9 isolates actually produced an antibiotic. These results are discussed.'

Title: 'Assessment of livestock grazing pressure in and around the elephant corridors in Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary, south India'

Abstract: 'Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary in southern India plays an important role in biodiversity conservation, especially of large mammals, by offering habitat contiguity of about 3300 km2 with three other protected areas in the region, namely Nagarahole and Bandipur National Parks and Wynaad Wildlife Sanctuary through forest corridors between the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats forests. The habitat linkage is crucial for large ranging animals such as elephants, which use these forest corridors for migration. Livestock grazing, a major biotic interference in forest corridors, originates from seven settlements of the Masinagudi group of villages on the eastern and the southeastern fringes of the sanctuary. Construction of a series of hydroelectric power stations, numbering about three at Singara, Marvakandy (Masinagudi) and Moyar, around the Masinagudi villages caused a rapid growth in human population (143% between 1961 and 1991), particularly the landless labourers and livestock. Free grazing by about 15 000\xe2\x80\x9317 000 resident as well as migratory livestock every year in and around the forest corridors, coupled with removal of cattle dung from the forest floor, have adversely affected the forest regeneration and helped proliferation of weed species such as Lantana camara, Casia tora, C. occidentalis, Opuntia dillenii, and Ageratum conyzoides. The annual fodder production from the corridor forest could meet the demand of about two-thirds of the resident population, while the crop residues from the marginal agriculture could not support the remaining one-third livestock population. In view of such a situation, measures have been suggested to reduce livestock population and implement the ecodevelopment packages in order to ensure the corridor connectivity for the long-term conservation of the elephant population.'

Abstract: 'The annual growth cycles of terrestrial ecosystems are related to long-term regional/global climatic patterns. Understanding vegetation phenology and its spatio-temporal variation is required to reveal and predict ongoing changes in Earth system dynamics. The study attempts to characterize the phenology of the major tropical vegetation types in India, since such information is not yet available for India. Multi-temporal Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) data were utilized to derive onset of greenness (OG) and end of senescence (ES) for four major tropical vegetation types. The study found that Fourier-smoothed results using the first four components revealed adequately the annual phenological variation of the natural vegetation types in India. From these smoothed data, inflection points were located iteratively through a spatio-temporal search, spanning over 18\xc2\xa0months of 8-day composite data, per pixel such as to derive the OG and ES. The median OG and ES was extracted from the available annual results for the years 2003\xe2\x80\x9304, 2004\xe2\x80\x9305, 2005\xe2\x80\x9306 and 2006\xe2\x80\x9307. The GLC2000 land cover map (1\xc2\xa0km spatial resolution) was utilized to determine the locations of the major vegetation types. The percentage of each vegetation type falling beneath a MTCI composite pixel (4.6\xc2\xa0km spatial resolution) was calculated. MTCI composite pixels with homogeneity of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa580% vegetative cover were used for examining pattern of phenology in different regions, different years and at different latitudes. The most common dates for the occurrence of OG for the tropical evergreen, semi-evergreen, moist-deciduous, and dry-deciduous vegetation types were found to be during February\xe2\x80\x93April, January\xe2\x80\x93April, March\xe2\x80\x93May, and February\xe2\x80\x93May, respectively. Similarly, for ES the most common dates were in February\xe2\x80\x93April, January\xe2\x80\x93April, February\xe2\x80\x93April, and December\xe2\x80\x93April, respectively. The phenological pattern was uniquely different for each vegetation type, as expected, and also differed with regions and latitudes. A general trend of early occurrence of OG in the lower latitudes was observed.'

Abstract: 'The study was carried out with an aim to assess the heavy metal (HM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the air of a biodiversity as well as tourist-rich area of Western Ghats by applying a most frequent growing lichen Remototrachyna awasthii (Hale and Patw.) Divakar and A. Crespo, as biomonitor. Thalli of R. awasthii were collected from eight sites of Mahabaleshwar area located in Western Ghats. Samples were prepared for HM and PAHs quantification by ICP-MS and HPLC, respectively. Total metal concentration (HM) ranged from 644 to 2,277.5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921 while PAHs concentration between 0.193 and 54.78\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921. HM and PAHs concentrations were the highest at Bus\xc2\xa0Stand while control site (Lingmala Fall) exhibited the lowest concentration of HM as well as PAHs followed by samples from Wilson point (both these sites are having trekking route). It was also evident from this study that vehicular emission played a significant role in the release of HM and PAHs as pollutants in the environment. The effectiveness of R. awasthii as biomonitor could be further investigated by comparing this species with other biomonitors.'

Abstract: 'Microsatellite loci are widely used in population and conservation genetic studies of amphibians, but the availability of such markers for tropical and subtropical taxa is currently very limited. In order to develop resources for conservation genetic studies in the genus Indirana, we tested amplification success and polymorphism in 62 previously developed microsatellite loci, in eight Indirana species - including new candidate species. Developing genomic resources for this amphibian taxon is particularly important as it is endemic to the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, and harbours several endangered species.'

Abstract: 'The Western Ghats constitute one of the three biodiversity hot spots in India, which is under constant threat from various quarters. Among the several anthropogenic causes, fire is one of the important anthropogenic factor, which plays a pivotal role in vegetation succession and ecosystem processes. It is very important to understand the ecological changes due to fire and other anthropogenic factors for conservation and management of biodiversity. Because of its synoptic, multi-spectral and multi-temporal nature remote sensing data can be a good source for forest fire monitoring. In the present study, an effort has been made to monitor the burnt areas using March 2000 and 2004 IRS LISS \xe2\x80\x94 III data. The study revealed that an area of 2.15 km2 and 4.46 km2 was affected by fire in 2000 and 2004 respectively. Repeated drought, followed by mass flowering and dying of bamboo accelerated the spread of fire from ground to canopy in areas with high bamboo density.'

Abstract: 'This study examined the impact of disturbance on the pattern of diversity, forest structure and regeneration of tree species in the Vindhyan dry tropical forest of India. A total of 1500\xc2\xa0quadrats distributed over five, 3-ha permanent plots in five sites, differing in degree of disturbance, were used to enumerate and measure the tree species. A total of 65 species with 136,983 individuals were enumerated in the total 15-ha area for stems \xe2\x89\xa5 30\xc2\xa0cm height. The number of species and number of stems ranged from 12 to 50 and 8063\xe2\x80\x9365331\xc2\xa0per 3-ha area. The number of species and stems for trees \xe2\x89\xa510\xc2\xa0cm\xc2\xa0dbh ranged from 3 to 28 species, with a mean value of 16 species ha\xe2\x88\x921, and from 16 to 477 stems, with a mean value of 256 stems ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. The adult based PCA ordination indicated uniqueness of sites in terms of species composition and habitat characteristics. PCA ordination also showed uniqueness of sites in terms of seedling composition, but the seedling and adult distributions were not spatially associated. The distinct species composition at the different sites and at the two life-cycle stages on the same site is indicative of marked spatio-temporal dynamics of the dry tropical forest. The density\xe2\x80\x93diameter semi-logarithmic curves ranged from a near linear to an overall concave appearance with a limited plateau in the mid-diameter ranges. The \xce\xb1-diversity and its components decreased with increasing disturbance intensity, reflecting enhanced utilization pressure with increasing disturbance. The site-wise and species-wise regression analyses of the number of individuals in different stages of the species revealed that both the level of disturbance and the nature of species strongly affect the regeneration. In conclusion, although the forest is relatively species-poor, the differential species composition on different sites and the temporal dynamics lend a unique level of diversity to the tropical dry deciduous forest.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation is recognized as one of the most significant component in LULC and global changes scenario. It is imperative to assess its trend and the rates at which it is occurring. The changes will have long-lasting impact on regional climate and in turn on biodiversity. In North-East India, one of the recognized global biodiversity hotspots, approximately 30% of total forest cover is under pressure of rapid land use changes. This region harbors variety of rare and endemic species of flora and fauna. It also has a strong bearing on regional climatic conditions. Extensive shifting cultivation, compounded by increasing population pressure and demands for agriculture land are the prime drivers in addition to other proximate drivers of deforestation. It is therefore of prime concern to analyse forest cover changes in the region, assess rate of change and extent and to identify the areas, which show repetitive changes. We analyzed forest cover maps from six temporal datasets based on satellite data interpretation, converted to geospatial database since 1972 till 1999. The states of Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura show highest changes in forest cover. Arunachal Pradesh shows least dynamic areas and maintains a good forest cover owing to its topographical inaccessibility in some areas. The present study reports the forest cover changes in the region using geospatial analysis and analyse them to devise proper management strategies.'

Abstract: 'Climate change enhances invasive species distribution by altering species composition in native ecosystems. Here we assessed harmony in plant invasions of two perennial exotic species of similar origin and naturalised in India, i.e., Chromolaena odorata and Tridax procumbens. Predictions made for the current condition was subsequently projected for the years 2050 and 2100 for both moderate and extreme climate change scenarios. Maximum Entropy (Maxent) was applied to assess their habitat suitability, risk area identification and shifts in range sizes. The distribution of C. odorata could mostly depend on temperature and moisture availability; and invade the biodiversity-rich regions of India viz., the Eastern Ghats, the Western Ghats, the Eastern Himalaya and the north-eastern regions. The prevalence of T. procumbens in central regions of India could demonstrate its greater dependencies on precipitation seasonality and radiation than that on temperature. These discrepancies in climatic dependencies allowed both for a harmonious distribution, i.e., inhabiting in regions not utilised by other. Both are likely to reduce their potential distribution areas in the future climate, where moisture availability is a key factor for their range expansion. The capacity to tolerate a wide range of temperature and solar radiation allowed T. procumbens to manage climate change impacts more efficiently, compared with C. odorata. The present study reveals harmony in their distributions and suggests distinct conservation protocols for each of them to control their invasion risks.'

Abstract: 'The key aspect in planning and management of water resources is to analyze the runoff potential and erosion status of the river basin. For the detailed investigation of hydrological response, freely available Cartosat-1 (IRS-P5) data was used for the preparation of digital elevation model (DEM). The runoff potential and type of erosive process of 22 river basins originating in the global biodiversity hotspot of Western Ghats, was inferred through hypsometric analysis. Several parameters like Hypsometric integral (HI), maximum concavity (Eh), coordinates of slope inflection point (I) given by a* and h* and normalized height of hypsometric curve (h) were extracted from the hypsometric curves and used for understanding the hydrological responses. From the hypsometric curves, the landform evolution processes were inferred. Contribution of diffusive and fluvial processes in slope degradation of the river basins was understood. Basins with lesser area (<100 km2) were found to have a positive correlation between hypsometric integral and basin area, whereas for large basins no such correlation exists. Based on the study, river basins can be prioritized for the appropriate conservation measures.'

Abstract: 'India is a vast country in terms of natural resources and considered one of the mega- biodiversity countries in the world. The freshwater aquatic resources of the different river basins are unevenly distributed in space and time and the country is suffering from the increasing population and shortage of all kind of natural resources like water. To fulfill the water demand and mitigate flood and drought, Indian Government has been planning a huge scheme encompassing the Himalayas and most of India, by linking all major rivers through interlinking canals systems and building several dams. Though the concept of interlinking of rivers is novel and new in India, it had rather initiated long back in other countries of ancient civilization. This is considered as one of the options to remedy spatial mismatch in water availability and demand. To overcome those, National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has taken up massive project and nearly 30 links have been proposed to interlink the major rivers. The Government of India has approved the country\xe2\x80\x99s first river interlinking project on Ken\xe2\x80\x93Betwa and a MOU has been signed among the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh and the Union Government. The feasibility report of most of the links have been completed and detailed project reports of Ken\xe2\x80\x93Betwa River link is expected to be finalized soon. Our study indicated presence of rich fish diversity and threatened fishes in river Betwa and improved aquatic environment in river Ken which makes it a high priority area in view of proposed interlinking. The current state of knowledge indicates that large dams, interbasin transfers and water withdrawal from rivers have many negative as well as positive impacts on freshwater aquatic ecosystem. As regards to the impact on fish and aquatic biodiversity, there could be positive as well as negative impacts. The present paper is aimed at explaining and synthesizing the long term plan and its implications, creating baseline database, requirement of appropriate technology, manpower and related issues especially with reference to riverine aquatic ecosystem and conservation of fish biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'In a tropical wet montane evergreen forest in the southern peninsular India, the estimated stocking of dead wood is 90 \xc2\xb1 3 stems\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 and the total dead wood volume is 70.7 m3\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921. When the logs (downed dead trees more than 10.1 cm in diameter) constitute about 80% of the total deadwood stocking and volume, the rest is by snags (sound and rotting standing dead trees). Since the shola forest trees are characterized by their short stature with low to medium girth, about 89% of the total number of deadwood is of the size ranging from 10.1 cm to 40.0 cm in diameter. The estimated standing dead wood/standing live tree ratio is 0.16 indicating that the forest represents an old stand. Variations observed between logs and snags to change from a given decay class to the higher decay classes in two year period could be attributed to the facts that the logs would be in contact with soil for a relatively longer time and in turn would be in more contact with microorganisms and other decomposing agents.'

Abstract: 'Diversity of vascular plants was studied in three sacred groves of the Jaintia Hills, in northeast India. About 395 species, 250 genera, and 108 families comprising pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms were found in the groves. Orchidaceae, Rubiaceae, Asteraceae and Lauraceae were dominant families and Ficus was the largest genus, with nine species. About 160 tree species were distributed in canopy, subcanopy and under canopy strata of the forest. Concentration of tropical and temperate elements of the neighbouring Sino-Himalayan and Burma-Malayan regions, and endemic (54 species), rare (31 species) and primitive taxa (38 species) due to favourable climatic conditions and prolonged protection have contributed to the high species richness of the groves. Their better management and protection is important for the conservation of plant diversity in the region and also for the benefit of indigenous tribes of the state.'

Abstract: 'We examined the impact of picnic activities on forest diversity, structure, regeneration and vitality of tree species in the Bhawal National Park of Bangladesh. The study area was classified as a non-used, occasionally used and frequently used area on the basis of the intensity of the picnic activities. A total of 43 plant species were enumerated in the whole study area. The highest plant species richness (41 species) was observed in the non-used area whereas the lowest species richness (11 species) in the frequently used area. The diversity index decreased with the increase of picnic intensity whereas the concentration of dominance increased. Density of all plant groups except mature trees, and the basal area of the mature trees showed a declining trend from the non-used to frequently used area. The frequently used area exhibited very poor regeneration. Tree vitality decreased with the increase of picnic intensity. The relevance of our study as a basis for further research to determine the impact of tourism on biodiversity in Bangladesh is discussed.'

Abstract: 'The paper presents a geospatial modeling approach for the assessment of biological richness in Kuldiha wildlife sanctuary in Orissa located in the northern tip of the Eastern Ghats in India. Indian Remote Sensing satellite data of Resourcesat-1 LISS III and field sampling were used to model biological richness at 1:50,000 scale. It was found that the sanctuary is dominated by Sal mixed dry deciduous forest. The vegetation map prepared through visual interpretation of satellite imagery was subjected to landscape analysis and assessment of biotic disturbance using SPLAM software. The disturbance index together with species richness, ecosystem uniqueness, terrain complexity and total importance value was modeled to access the biological richness in the sanctuary. A total of 3.9 per cent area was found to posses very high plant richness followed by high (21.2%), medium (42.1%) and low (32.8%) in the sanctuary. The study demonstrated the geospatial technology in conjunction with landscape analysis, ground inventory and geospatial modeling seizes good potential for rapid assessment of biological richness. The fringe areas of the sanctuary having disturbance more because most of the small villages which are relocated from sanctuary, settled in those areas.'

Abstract: 'Consumption and processing of allochthonous plant litter by fishes is more common in tropical than temperate streams and rivers. Therefore, aquatic hyphomycetes in water (filtration), leaf litter (bubble chamber incubation), and fecal pellets (direct observation and inoculation to sterile leaf litter) of three dominant fishes belonging to the family Cyprinidae (Aplocheilus lineatus, Puntius filamentosus, and Rasbora daniconius) in two locations of the River Kali of the Western Ghats, India, were evaluated during postmonsoon season. Spores of 14 and 9 species of aquatic hyphomycetes were recovered on filtering water samples of Kaiga stream and Kadra dam with equal number of spores (32 spores \xc2\xb7 100 mL\xe2\x88\x921) and high Shannon diversity in Kaiga stream. In a bubble chamber incubation of leaf litter, 16 and 9 species were recovered from Kaiga stream and Kadra dam with high spore output (1122 versus 324 spores per mg dry mass) and high Shannon diversity in Kaiga stream. Both direct and indirect methods of examination of fecal pellets of fishes revealed more species in Kaiga stream than Kadra dam (4\xe2\x80\x937 versus 1\xe2\x80\x934 species). The spore release in leaf litter incubated with fecal pellets ranged from 2.3 to 98 spores\xc2\xb7mg\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xb7d\xe2\x88\x921 with the highest Aplocheilus lineatus in Kaiga stream; while in Kadra dam, it was from 0.02 to 22.9 spores\xc2\xb7mg\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xb7d\xe2\x88\x921 with the highest in Puntius filamentosus. The Shannon diversity of aquatic hyphomycetes was high in fecal pellets of Aplocheilus lineatus of Kaiga stream and Rasbora daniconius of Kadra dam. The top-ranked five species of aquatic hyphomycetes differed in water, leaf litter, and fish fecal pellets; however, Triscelophorus konajensis was common for all. All five top-ranked species of aquatic hyphomycetes in feces produced multicelled spores; thus, they were likely to have a better chance of viability through gut passage than single-celled spores. Preferential feeding, fungi in gut and feces, and survival and dissemination of spores by invertebrates and fishes with reference to aquatic hyphomycetes were discussed.'

Title: 'Tree species as hosts for arbuscular mycorrhizal and dark septate endophyte fungi'

Abstract: 'A survey of 35 tree species (belonging to 28 genera in 19 families) in Aliyar, South India was carried out to ascertain their arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and dark septate endophyte (DSE) fungal status. All the tree species examined had AM association. AM and DSE colonization is reported for the first time in 20 and 14 species respectively. Cooccurrence of AM and DSE was observed in 14 (40%) tree species. The extent of DSE colonization was inversely related to the extent of AM fungal colonization. Six tree species had Arum-type, 18 had intermediatetype and 11 had typical Paris-type AM morphology. AM fungal spore morphotypes belonging to 11 species in two genera were isolated from the rhizosphere soil. AM fungal spore numbers were not related to the extent of AM colonization and Glomus dominated spore diversity. AM association individually and along with DSE were found respectively in the 63% and 44% of the economically important tree species. The occurrence of AM and DSE fungal association in economically important indigenous tree species indicates the possibility of exploiting this association in future conservation programmes of these species.'

Abstract: 'Anthropogenic disturbances influence plant regeneration and species diversity, which impact the conservation status of protected areas. A study was conducted in the Sitakund Botanical Garden and Eco-park (SBGE), Chittagong, Bangladesh to analyze the natural regeneration and tree species diversity in disturbed and less disturbed zones. Stratified and systematic random sampling was used to select 50 sample plots from each of the two zones. A total number of 109 plant species from 43 families were recorded in the study; of which 93 species were of natural origin while the rest were planted. From the species with natural origin 66 were tree species, 9 were shrub species and 18 were climbers. Species richness, density of regeneration and disturbance index in the height classes (0\xe2\x80\x930.5 m) and (dbh > 6 cm) indicated significant differences between the zones. The study analyzed how disturbances affect species diversity in the area. It was found that species richness and basal area are negatively related with disturbances. Moreover, density (N/ha) of trees was more likely to decrease with increasing tree height that reflects the huge demand of local people to harvest large trees as part of their income generating activities. The study findings have implications for future management decisions of the SGBE. To restore these ecosystems, management should focus on both biodiversity conservation and providing benefits to local people without hampering forest ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation and fragmentation are important concerns in managing and conserving tropical forests and have global significance. In the Indian context, in the last one century, the forests have undergone significant changes due to several policies undertaken by government as well as increased population pressure. The present study has brought out spatiotemporal changes in forest cover and variation in forest type in the state of Odisha (Orissa), India, during the last 75\xc2\xa0years period. The mapping for the period of 1924\xe2\x80\x931935, 1975, 1985, 1995 and 2010 indicates that the forest cover accounts for 81,785.6\xc2\xa0km2 (52.5\xc2\xa0%), 56,661.1\xc2\xa0km2 (36.4\xc2\xa0%), 51,642.3\xc2\xa0km2 (33.2\xc2\xa0%), 49,773\xc2\xa0km2 (32\xc2\xa0%) and 48,669.4\xc2\xa0km2 (31.3\xc2\xa0%) of the study area, respectively. The study found the net forest cover decline as 40.5\xc2\xa0% of the total forest and mean annual rate of deforestation as 0.69\xc2\xa0%\xe2\x80\x89year\xe2\x88\x921 during 1935 to 2010. There is a decline in annual rate of deforestation during 1995 to 2010 which was estimated as 0.15\xc2\xa0%. Forest type-wise quantitative loss of forest cover reveals large scale deforestation of dry deciduous forests. The landscape analysis shows that the number of forest patches (per 1,000) are 2.463 in 1935, 10.390 in 1975, 11.899 in 1985, 12.193 in 1995 and 15.102 in 2010, which indicates high anthropogenic pressure on the forests. The mean patch size (km2) of forest decreased from 33.2 in 1935 to 5.5 in 1975 and reached to 3.2 by 2010. The study demonstrated that monitoring of long term forest changes, quantitative loss of forest types and landscape metrics provides critical inputs for management of forest resources.'

Title: 'Future of wetlands in tropical and subtropical Asia, especially in the face of climate change'
Author: 'Brij\xc2\xa0Gopal'

Abstract: 'Tropical and subtropical Asia differs from other tropical regions in its monsoonal climate and the dominant influence of the Hindukush and Himalayan mountain ranges which result in extremes of spatial and temporal variability in precipitation. However, several major rivers and their tributaries arise in the Himalayan ranges and are fed by thousands of glaciers. Huge sediment loads carried by these rivers result in important deltas at their mouths. The climatic and physiographic diversity have endowed the region with many kinds of wetlands. Of these, the peatswamps of southeast Asia constitute about 56% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s tropical peatlands, and more than 42% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s mangroves occur in South and southeast Asia. Among other wetlands, riverine swamps are rather restricted whereas the seasonal marshes are a dominant feature. Another characteristic feature of tropical Asia are the innumerable human-made and intensively managed wetlands of which the paddy fields and aquaculture ponds are the most extensive. Throughout tropical Asia, wetlands have been a part of the socio-cultural ethos of the people and many communities have lived in wetlands. However, the pressures of high population and the economic development have extensively impacted upon wetlands which have been transformed for paddy cultivation and aquaculture, drained and converted to other land uses for economic gains (e.g., conversion to oil palm), and degraded by discharge of domestic and industrial wastes. Invasive plant and animal species have also played a significant role. The climate change is already being felt in the rapid retreat of Himalayan glaciers, increased temperature and variability in precipitation as well as the frequency of extreme events. Sea level rise is seen as a major threat to the coastal wetlands, particularly the mangroves. Increasing droughts have caused frequent fires in Indonesian peat swamps that have further feedback impacts on regional climate. However, the actual threat to wetlands in this region arises from the extensive hydrological alterations being caused by storage, abstraction and diversion of river flows for agriculture, industry and hydropower. Currently, the state of our understanding wetlands in general, and the efforts and infrastructure for research and training in wetlands are very poor. Although a few wetlands have been designated as Ramsar sites, the policies aimed at wetland conservation are either non-existent or very weak. Human responses to greater uncertainty and variability in the available water resources in different parts of Asia will be crucial to the conservation of wetlands in the future.'

Abstract: 'Khawa Karpo, in the eastern Himalayas, is a mountain considered sacred throughout Tibet, and is internationally recognized as a global biodiversity hotspot. Numerous areas within this landscape are considered \xe2\x80\x98sacred\xe2\x80\x99 by the indigenous Tibetans of the region, who interact with these sites in ways potentially beneficial to conservation. Our previous remote sensing study indicated that sacred sites are found in habitats with greater species richness, diversity, and endemism than randomly selected non-sacred sites. This study examines the role of sanctity in biodiversity conservation within habitats in the Khawa Karpo region by pairing plots within the same habitats in sacred and non-sacred areas. Understory richness, diversity, cover, and number of useful species are measured; for trees, richness, diversity, cover, and density are measured. Results indicate that within habitats sanctity does not affect understory plant communities; however, within sacred areas trees are larger (p = 0.003) and forests have greater cover (p = 0.003) than non-sacred areas. Our results indicate that, whereas placement of sacred areas and preservation of vegetation cover affects useful plants, biodiversity and endemism, within habitats sacred sites preserve old growth trees and forest structure. In sum, Tibetan sacred sites are ecologically unique and important for conservation on varying scales of landscape, community, and species.'

Abstract: 'Landscapes consist of heterogeneous interacting dynamic elements with complex ecological, economic and cultural attributes. These complex interactions help in the sustenance of natural resources through bio-geochemical and hydrological cycling. The ecosystem functions are altered with changes in the landscape structure. Fragmentation of large contiguous forests to small and isolated forest patches either by natural phenomena or anthropogenic activities leads to drastic changes in forest patch sizes, shape, connectivity and internal heterogeneity, which restrict the movement leading to inbreeding among Meta populations with extirpation of species.'

Abstract: ' Gonoproktopterus curmuca is an endangered red tailed barb found in Southern part of Western Ghat, India. As a part of stock-specific, propagation assisted rehabilitation and management program, polymorphic microsatellites markers were used to study the genetic diversity and population structure of this species from the three River systems of Southern Western Ghats, such as Periyar River, the Chalakkudy River, and the Chaliyar River. From selected eight polymorphic microsatellite markers, the number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 8, and the average number of alleles among 3 populations ranged from 5.0 to 5.75. The mean observed (Hob) and expected (Hex) heterozygosity ranged from 0.5148 to 0.5360 and from 0.5996 to 0.6067, respectively. Significant deviations from Hardy\xe2\x80\x93Weinberg Equilibrium expectation were found at majority of the loci (except Gcur MFW72 and Gcur MFW19) and in all three populations in which heterozygote deficits were apparent. The analysis of molecular variance indicates that the percent of variance among populations and within populations were 6.73 and 93.27, respectively. The pairwise FST values between populations indicate that there were significant deviations in genetic differentiations for the red-tailed barb populations from these three Rivers of the Western Ghats, India. The microsatellites methods reported a low degree of gene diversity and lack of genetic heterogeneity in the population of G. curmuca, which strongly emphasize the need of fishery management, conservation and rehabilitation of G. curmuca.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization and spore population was investigated in different agroforestry trees and crop species collected from different locations of Dinajpur district of Bangladesh. Roots and rhizosphere soils of Albizia procera Benth., Capsicum frutescens L, Curcuma domestica Vahl., Dalbergia sissoo Roxb. and Swietenia macrophylla King. from Dashmail; C. domestica, D. sissoo, Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnn., Gmelina arborea (Roxb) DC and Oryza sativa L. from Kantaji and C. domestica, D. sissoo, Litchi chinensis Sonn. and O. sativa from Ramsagar were collected. Roots and soils were assessed following standard methods. The range of AM colonization was recorded 36%\xe2\x80\x9379% from Dashmail. The highest AM colonization was recorded in C. frutescens (79%) and the lowest was in C. domestica (36%). The range of colonization was recorded as 33%\xe2\x80\x9370% from Kantaji. The highest AM colonization was recorded in G. arborea (70%) and the lowest was in O. sativa (33%). The range of AM colonization was recorded as 35%\xe2\x80\x9370% from Ramsagar. The highest AM colonization was recorded in D. sissoo (70%) and the lowest was in O. sativa (35%). Arbuscular mycorrhizal spore population varied from 54 to 140/100g dry soil in the soils from Dashmail. The highest was in the soils of D. sissoo (140) and the lowest was in C. domestica (54). The spore population varied from 63 to 221 in Kantaji. The highest was in G. arborea (221) and the lowest was in O. sativa (63). The range population in Ramsagar varied from 69 to 160. The highest was recorded in D. sissoo (160) and the lowest was in L. chinensis (69). No significant relationship of soil pH and soil OM with AM colonization and with spore population was observed. Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s index of diversity (Ds) and Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s index of diversity-(Hs) were highest in the soil of D. sissoo from Kantaji and the lowest in the soils of O. sativa from Ramsagar. Biodiversity of AM colonization, spore population and the distribution of AM fungi in the rhizosphere soils of different agroforestry plants indicated the occurrence of AM fungi, mycotrophic nature of the trees and crop species, contribution and necessity of AM fungi and the AM dependence of the agroforestry plants growing in Dinajpur district of Bangladesh.'

Abstract: 'Knowledge on the structure and composition of the plant communities has enormous significance in conservation and management of forests. The present study aimed to assess the community attributes, viz., structure, composition and diversity in the moist and dry sal (Shorea robusta) forests in the West Bengal province of India and compare them with the other sal forests of India. The phytosociological data from these forests were quantitatively analysed to work out the species richness, diversity, evenness, dominance, importance value, stand density and the basal area. The analysis showed that plant richness and diversity in moist sal forests of northern West Bengal are higher than the dry sal forests of south-west Bengal; a total of 134 tree (cbh \xe2\x89\xa530\xc2\xa0cm), 113 shrub and 230 herb species were recorded in the moist sal forest compared to 35 tree, 41 shrub and 96 herb species in dry sal forest. Papilionaceae was observed to be the dominant family. Dry sal forests had higher tree dominance (0.81) and stand density (1,006 stems\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) but lower basal area (19.62 m2ha\xe2\x88\x921) while moist sal forest had lower tree dominance (0.18) and stand density (438 stems\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) but higher basal area (56.52\xc2\xa0m2ha\xe2\x88\x921). Tree species richness and stem density across girth classes in both the types decreased from the smallest to largest trees, while the occurrence rate of species increased with increase in girth class. A t-test showed significant differences in species richness, basal area and the stand density at 95% confidence level (p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0<0.05) in the two forest types. The CCA indicated very low overall match (canonical correlation value\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.40) between the two sets of variables from moist and dry sal types. The differences in these forests could be attributed to the distinct variations in climatic conditions- mainly the rainfall, disturbance regimes and the management practices.'

Abstract: 'A morphometric evaluation of Tamiraparani subbasin was carried out to determine the drainage characteristics using GIS model technique. Extraction of the subbasin and stream network model has been developed to quantify the drainage parameters in the study area. The input parameters required to run this model are: a pour point, a minimum upstream area in hectares, and a digital elevation model. After execution, the model provides a drainage basin with Strahler\xe2\x80\x99s classified stream network supported by thematic layers like aspect, slope, relief, and drainage density. The developed model reveals that the drainage area of this subbasin is 2,055\xc2\xa0km2 and shows subdendritic to dendritic drainage pattern. The basin includes seventh order stream and mostly dominated by lower stream order. The slope of the study area varies from 0\xc2\xb0 in the east to 61\xc2\xb0 towards west. The presence of Western Ghats is the chief controlling factor for slope variation. Moreover, the slope variation is controlled by the local lithology and erosion cycles. The bifurcation ratio indicates that the geological structures have little influence on the drainage networks and the drainage density reveals that the nature of subsurface strata is permeable.'

Abstract: 'We present here the first use of DNA barcoding in a new approach to ethnobotany we coined "ethnobotany genomics". This new approach is founded on the concept of \'assemblage\' of biodiversity knowledge, which includes a coming together of different ways of knowing and valorizing species variation in a novel approach seeking to add value to both traditional knowledge (TK) and scientific knowledge (SK). We employed contemporary genomic technology, DNA barcoding, as an important tool for identifying cryptic species, which were already recognized ethnotaxa using the TK classification systems of local cultures in the Velliangiri Hills of India. This research is based on several case studies in our lab, which define an approach to that is poised to evolve quickly with the advent of new ideas and technology. Our results show that DNA barcoding validated several new cryptic plant species to science that were previously recognized by TK classifications of the Irulas and Malasars, and were lumped using SK classification. The contribution of the local aboriginal knowledge concerning plant diversity and utility in India is considerable; our study presents new ethnomedicine to science. Ethnobotany genomics can also be used to determine the distribution of rare species and their ecological requirements, including traditional ecological knowledge so that conservation strategies can be implemented. This is aligned with the Convention on Biological Diversity that was signed by over 150 nations, and thus the world\'s complex array of human-natural-technological relationships has effectively been re-organized.'

Abstract: 'The diversity of plants in tropical forests makes dietary studies of frugivores difficult. This paper provides a botanical inventory of a tropical seasonal forest community in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand. The forest is valuable from a conservation perspective because it is one of the last remaining intact forests in northeastern Thailand, and is an important refuge for many animal and plant species. A 4-ha inventory plot measuring 200 \xc3\x97 200\xc2\xa0m was established and all plants greater than or equal to 10\xc2\xa0cm in diameter at breast height (dbh) were measured and permanently labeled. We found 1610 stems belonging to 105 species, 76 genera and 35 families, with a combined basal area of 142.5\xc2\xa0m2. The community was dominated by species of Lauraceae, Cornaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Meliaceae, and Elaeocarpaceae. About one-third of the plant species (40 spp.) identified in this study were vulnerable to extinction because they were mostly dispersed by large frugivores, which were intolerant of human impact. If they disappear, these forests may become dominated by plant species that are dispersed by abiotic means and species with small-seeded fruits.'

Abstract: 'Sustainable extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has recently gained considerable attention as a means to enhance rural incomes and conserve tropical forests. However, there is little information on the amounts of products collected per unit area and the impact of extraction on forest structure and composition. In this paper we estimate the quantities of selected products gathered by the Soligas, the indigenous people in the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) sanctuary in Karnataka, India, and examine the effect of extraction on forest structure and composition. Two sites, distant (DS) and proximal (PS), were identified based on the proximity to a Soliga settlement. The frequency of different size classes indicates that regeneration overall is poor in the area. The two sites show differences in species richness, basal area, and tree mortality. Furthermore, non-timber forest product species show a greater deficit of small size classes than the timber forest species, suggesting that regeneration is affected by collection of seeds and fruits from non-timber forest product species. Regeneration, however, may also be affected by other anthropogenic pressures such as fire, grazing and competition with weeds.'

Abstract: 'Insect gut microbial community is known to produce biotechnologically important products. Present study is focussed on isolation of bacteria and screening of siderophore producing strains of Sathrophyllia femorata collected from Western Ghats region near Pune, Maharashtra, India (19\xc2\xb020\xe2\x80\xb2N and 73\xc2\xb047\xe2\x80\xb2E). Total 207 bacteria were isolated from gut of 2 different specimens (DM and EM) of grasshopper belonging to S. femorata. Out of 207 bacterial isolates, 166 (79\xc2\xa0%) isolates produced siderophore during their submerged growth in iron deficient succinic acid medium. Among these, 24 isolates produced copious amount of siderophore and hence selected for further study. Further analysis of these isolates showed absorption maxima either at 240 or at 250\xc2\xa0nm depending on type of siderophore. Molecular identification of these siderophore producing bacteria based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirms their affiliation to 37 species representing 19 genera. Dominance of phylum Proteobacteria followed by Firmicutes was observed. Among 19 genera, gammaproteobacteria like Acinetobacter, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas showed abundance over other genera like Serratia, Stenotrophomonas and Yokenella. Some of these bacteria have been used in plant growth promotion and as biocontrol agents against insect pests of plants. Siderophore producing bacteria having insecticidal activity against the insect pests promoting plant growth can serve as green bioinoculants for sustainable agriculture.'

Abstract: 'There is a constant need for novel antibiotic and antioxidant sources due to the ever-increasing resilience of pathogens and the occurrence of chronic diseases. The natural sources of these agents have advantages due to lower production cost, structural variation, and uses of active compounds for pharmaceutical uses. The microbes living in planta termed \xe2\x80\x9cendophytes\xe2\x80\x9d are alternative sources of host bioactive compounds. In this study, ten endophytic fungi were isolated from Polygonum chinense L. and identified by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer regions. The fungal strains were fermented and the ethyl acetate extracts were evaluated for antimicrobial and antioxidant capacities. Almost 80% of the endophytes showed antibacterial potency against one or more pathogenic bacteria. Among all strains, Penicillium canescens showed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens as well as significant antioxidative and DNA protective capacities. The strain Fusarium chlamydosporum displayed significant anti-radical (126.8\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x896.7\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml) and ferric reducing (84.7\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892.1\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0AA/g dry extract) capacities. The bio-autography, chromatography, and mass spectroscopy analyses of P. canescens extract revealed the presence of sesquiterpene (germacrene), plasticizer (phthalic acid ester) along with phenolic acids, flavonoid (quercetin), and short chain hydrocarbons. The secondary metabolites of F. chlamydosporum were identified with phenolic acids as bioactive compounds by chromatography and mass spectroscopy. This study indicates P. chinense endophytes as potential sources of antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds for novel drug discovery.'

Abstract: 'It is generally considered difficult to resolve negative unidirectional externalities within hydro-hegemonic basins in which the upstream powerful riparian has the incentive to unilaterally develop the river without regard to downstream consequences. Weaker downstream riparian states can resort to issue linkages and side payments to coerce a change in the upstream hydro-hegemon\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, but the success of these tools depends on the specific political and economic situation in the basin and on the preferences of the hydro-hegemonic state for cooperation. Neglected in the literature is another possibility. Through a consideration of the sanctioned discourse of watershed management at the domestic levels, this article shows that domestic environmental non-governmental organizations and policy entrepreneurs\xe2\x80\x94through the application of a range of tools\xe2\x80\x94can work to change the domestic water management discourse from a state-hydraulic paradigm to a more sustainable water management paradigm. When these efforts are successful, we can find that these non-state actors can perform a crucial function in cleaning up domestic stretches of international rivers, which produces positive externalities downstream. In the process, they are able of achieving what often years of international negotiations failed to accomplish. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, India\xe2\x80\x99s policies on water quality in the national stretches of Ganges Basin and China\xe2\x80\x99s policies on biodiversity in the national stretches of the Mekong Basin are used to make this argument.'

Abstract: 'Plant invasion is highly responsive to rising temperature, altered precipitation and various anthropogenic disturbances. Therefore, climate anomalies might provide opportunities to identify the relationship of past climate in deriving the distribution of invasive species and to detect their probable future distribution. In this work, we studied the correlation of climate anomaly i.e. temperature and precipitation with an indicative map of plant invasive species (1\xc2\xb0 grid) of India. The indicative map was generated through the plant data available from the project \xe2\x80\x98Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level\xe2\x80\x99. Climate anomaly was calculated and represented by average temperature and precipitation using \xe2\x80\x98Climate Research Unit\xe2\x80\x99 data for the period of 1901 to 2000. A comparison of local geographically weighted regression (GWR) model and a global ordinary least square regression (OLS) model was carried out for statistical analysis to depict the correlation at 1\xc2\xb0 spatial grids. Overall, 20,501 records with a total of 9112 unique plots and 161 unique invasive species were recorded in the database that shows a maximum of 15 invasive species in a 0.04\xc2\xa0ha nested quadrat. Cumulative analysis showed a maximum of 53 invasive species at 1\xc2\xb0 grid. Individually, GWR could reveal a significant correlation with invasive species distribution for temperature anomaly (r2\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.73, AIC=\xe2\x80\x892206) and precipitation anomaly (r2\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.74, AIC=\xe2\x80\x892221), while OLS model did not offer a good correlation (r2\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001, AIC\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x892400) compared to GWR. Combination of temperature and precipitation anomaly (shared model) showed an improved spatial correlation (r2\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x890.75) using GWR. Variation partitioning revealed the dominant influence (>\xe2\x80\x890.40 of variation) of temperature anomaly over Deccan Peninsula, Himalaya and North East zone. Influence of precipitation anomaly was more prominent over arid and semi-arid zone explaining >\xe2\x80\x890.35 of variation. Results revealed the strength of GWR to see the interaction of invasive plant species w.r.t. climate anomalies that explain the influence of spatial variation due to heterogeneity at varying neighbour distances. The significant correlation of invasive species with both the anomalies revealed the affinity of invasive species towards warmer, drier and wet places. This gives an indication that the distribution of invasive species could be triggered by climate anomaly. The use of other predictor variables (i.e. edaphic and anthropogenic) could be an inclusive input in a future perspective.'

Abstract: 'The sal (Shorea robusta) forest vegetation of Sohagibarawa Wildlife Sanctuary, Gorakhpur, India was analysed to assess plant diversity, regeneration pattern and the status of species conservation. A total of 208 plant species representing 165 genera and 72 families were recorded. Species richness, mean density and basal area of individuals in the observed forest were compared with those of other sal-dominated forests of India. The sal forest was rich in Papilionaceae (23 species), which contributed maximally to the total number of individuals of <30 cm girth. After sal, density was maximal for a leguminous shrub, Moghania chappar. In addition to the usual recruitment by seed, a number of species also showed non-seed regeneration through storage roots, sprouts or ramet proliferation. The individuals regenerating as sprouts from underground stem or storage organs contributed significantly to the sum total of individuals/ha. As much as 45.5% of the total individuals were of ramet origin and shared 10.6% of the total species richness of the forest. In stands facing moderate to low disturbance, thickets of dense entangled mass of vegetation, predominantly composed of thorny lianas, were identified that usually contained less common and rare species like Rauwolfia serpentina, Desmodium latifolium, Crotalaria alata and Gloriosa superba in addition to the frequent ones. These thickets help to conserve the special habitat conditions and provide protection for natural regeneration of several infrequent and rare plant species and thus contribute towards the maintenance and in situ conservation of overall diversity of recurrently disturbed forest vegetation.'

These factors form a complex called the Replisome, which is assembled onto the DNA duplex to promote its unwinding and to catalyze the polymerization of two new strands. Key constituents of the Replisome are the Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS helicase and the And1-Claspin-Tipin-Tim1 complex, which coordinate DNA unwinding with polymerase alpha-, delta-, and epsilon- dependent DNA polymerization. These factors encounter numerous obstacles, such as endogenous DNA lesions leading to template breakage and complex structures arising from intrinsic features of specific DNA sequences. To overcome these roadblocks, homologous recombination DNA repair factors, such as Rad51 and the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex, are required to...'

Abstract: 'The concept of collecting surface runoff on the slopes in canals cut across the western slopes of the Western Ghats, in order to divert part of a flow in the west flowing rivers to the east by gravity, is being promoted in Karnataka. This paper presents a study of the hydrological feasibility of such canals, termed \xe2\x80\x98garland canals\xe2\x80\x99 and claimed to be an environmental friendly alternative to the conventional technologies for inter-basin transfer of water, by their promoters. The paper presents a methodology for disaggregating normal annual rainfall into 15-min magnitudes and its application for simulating surface runoff, using a knowledge of infiltration rates on the slopes. The study has been carried out considering a part of a garland canal proposed for diverting the river Netravathi in the state. The results from the study reveal that significant amounts of flow can be collected in the proposed canal only if streams are also tapped and that because of the arrangements necessary for the purpose, garland canals cannot be considered a means superior to the conventional methods for diverting west flowing rivers.'

Title: 'Effects of patch size, disturbances on diversity and structural traits of tropical semi-evergreen forest in the lowland Indo Burma hotspot: implication on conservation of the threatened tree species'

Abstract: 'Information on geographic distribution, population and threat status of most globally red listed species in the Indo Burma zone are inadequate. Given the increase in the prevalence of isolated forest patches in the part of this hotspot, evaluation is necessary on how size of the remnant forest patches and on-going disturbances affects structure and diversity of remaining habitats including the population of some globally threatened tree species. Quantitative vegetation inventory by 500 m long and 10 m wide (0.5 ha) line transects were randomly set in nine fragmented tropical semi-evergreen forest patches in Tripura, Northeast India. The studied forests patches grouped into small, medium and large based on their respected sizes. Spatial variability was analysed in woody species diversity and structure along the patch size gradients and their response to both patch size and anthropogenic disturbances. Out of 167 species, 13 identified as red-listed species by IUCN under the present inventory. Most of the diversity and structural parameters showed statistically significant positive response with the forest patch size, except for stand dominance, disturbance, sapling density and number of aggregated distribution pattern decreased when patch size increased. In addition, most of the diversity and structural attributes showed negative response with disturbances. Present baseline data would serve as an effective tool for management and protection of this important forest type. Future habitat restoration programme and strategies for relocation of additional population and re-introduction of those globally threatened trees are recommended.'

Abstract: ' Mikania micrantha, a creeper and climber, has invaded forests and agricultural areas in the Western Ghats. A quantification of the effect of Mikania on species richness and factors that contribute to its success would help to understand the invasion success of Mikania in the Western Ghats of India. This study investigated its impact on species richness and factors that contribute to its invasion success. Impact of Mikania on species richness was studied in areas invaded by Mikania and not yet invaded by Mikania by quadrat (1\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x891\xc2\xa0m2) method. Growth experiments were carried out with Mikania rhizosphere soil and soil treated with Mikania leaf leachate. Chemical characteristics such as electrical conductivity, organic matter, extractable P, total organic N and water-soluble phenolics, and microbial respiration of soil invaded by Mikania and not yet invaded by Mikania were measured. We observed lower species richness in areas invaded by Mikania compared to areas not yet invaded by Mikania. Seedling growth was suppressed in Mikania rhizosphere soil or soil treated with higher levels of Mikania leaf leachate. Higher levels of organic matter, total organic N and water-soluble phenolics, and lower microbial activity were observed in Mikania rhizosphere soil. Soil treated with Mikania leaf leachate has higher amounts of water-soluble phenolics. Mikania invasion appears to reduce plant species richness in the Western Ghats, and discourage seedling growth of certain plant species. Factors that are likely to contribute to Mikania success are its ability to pre-empt light and alter soil chemistry and biochemistry in ways that benefit the species.'

Abstract: 'The present study emphasized the production of biologically active terpenoid compound from Streptomyces rochei M32, which was isolated from Western Ghats ecosystem, South India. The presence of resistant genes like mecA, vanA of Staphylococcus aureus and bla SHV, bla TEM of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was confirmed by molecular studies. The isolated compound from Streptomyces rochei M32 inhibited wide range of standard and clinical drug resistant pathogens and enteric pathogens. The rice bran supplemented basal medium influenced the active compound production on 8th day of fermentation and yielded 1875\xc2\xa0mg of crude extract from 10\xc2\xa0g of rice bran substrate. Purification and characterization of crude ethyl acetate extract was achieved by preparative thin layer chromatography. The active fraction was identified as terpenoid class compound by chemical screening. Based on the results of spectral studies (NMR, LC\xe2\x80\x93MS, FTIR, etc.), the active compound was tentatively identified as 1, 19-bis (3-hydroxyazetidin-1-yl) nonadeca-5, 14-diene-1, 8, 12, 19-tetraone with molecular weight 462.41\xc2\xa0g/mol. Minimum inhibitory concentration value ranges between 7.6 and 31.2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g/mL against test organisms was observed. The cytotoxicity results on cervical cancer (HeLa) cell line showed IC50 value of 2.034\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g/mL. The corresponding compound is not previously reported from any microbial resources.'

Abstract: 'Tropical agro-forest landscapes are potentially valuable reserves of forest genetic resources for forestry and restoration of degraded forests. The Dipterocarpaceae is a dominant Southeast Asian family of tree species of global significance for the tropical timber industry. Very little information exists about how effective human modified landscapes are for conserving genetic diversity in dipterocarp species. This study provides a baseline for understanding how fragmented agro-forest landscapes in India sustain forest genetic resources in an endemic dipterocarp tree. We compare genetic diversity and fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) in the threatened tree species Vateria indica within an isolated and a continuous forest site in the Western Ghats, South India. We place these results in the context of dipterocarps from both the Seychelles and Borneo. Parentage analysis of 694 progeny using twelve nuclear microsatellite markers is applied to estimate pollen and seed dispersal. Using a nursery trial we evaluate effects of inbreeding on growth performance. Our results show that levels of FSGS, and gene dispersal are comparable between a small isolated and a large continuous site of V. indica. Realized long-distance pollen flow into the isolated patch appears to help maintaining genetic diversity. The nursery experiment suggests that selection favours outbred progeny. Individuals of V. indica in close proximity appear less related to each other than in another highly fragmented and endangered dipterocarp species from the Seychelles, but more related than in three dipterocarp species studied in continuous forest in Borneo. We discuss the wider implications of our findings in the context of conservation and restoration of dipterocarp forest genetic resources in fragmented populations.'

Abstract: 'We examined demographic consequences of habitat fragmentation in the lion-tailed macaque in the Anamalai Hills in southern Western Ghats. The parameters examined were group size, age/sex composition, and birth rate, in relation to various habitat parameters. Demographic parameters were estimated for 11 groups in 8 rain forest fragments, during January to May 1996. Area, tree density, canopy cover, canopy height, and tree basal area were estimated for these fragments. As fragment area decreased, there was a decline in birth rate and proportion of immatures in the group, and an increase in the number of adult males, and the variability in group size and adult sex ratios. A similar pattern was also observed with decreasing values of other habitat variables. Differences in the founder population size and age structure, demographic randomness, and history of poaching have caused greater variability in group size and adult sex ratios in the small fragments. The lack of dispersal in the small fragments is another reason for the high variability.'

Abstract: 'A multi-thematic analysis based on different physical factors has been adopted to generate integrated maps on erosion proneness as well as on critical slope under a GIS platform for terrain evaluation. This spatial data on erosion proneness has demonstrated that 17.62 km2 area, out of the 140 km2 in the catchment zone, needs careful attention for ecorestoration. In the critical slope map four land stability classes have been demarcated. The area represented as Unstable and Moderately-stable is found to be important for slope stability problems. Temporal change in the drainage network over a period of four decades as well as the extent of loss in the perennial status of tributaries have been recorded to evaluate the landform changes. A catchment treatment plan has also been suggested.'

Abstract: 'The history of ecology and evolutionary biology is rife with attempts to define and delimit species. However, there has been confusion between concepts and criteria, which has led to discussion, debate, and conflict, eventually leading to lack of consistency in delimitation. Here, we provide a broad review of species concepts, a clarification of category versus concept, an account of the general lineage concept (GLC), and finally a way forward for species discovery and delimitation. Historically, species were considered as varieties bound together by reproduction. After over 200 years of uncertainty, Mayr attempted to bring coherence to the definition of species through the biological species concept (BSC). This has, however, received much criticism, and the last half century has spawned at least 20 other concepts. A central philosophical problem is that concepts treat species as \xe2\x80\x98individuals\xe2\x80\x99 while the criteria for categorization treats them as \xe2\x80\x98classes\xe2\x80\x99. While not getting away from this problem entirely, the GLC attempts to provide a framework where lineage divergence is influenced by a number of different factors (and correlated to different traits) which relate to the different species concepts. We also introduce an \xe2\x80\x98inclusive\xe2\x80\x99 probabilistic approach for understanding and delimiting species. Finally, we provide a Wallacean (geography related) approach to the Linnaean problem of identifying and delimiting species, particularly for cases of allopatric divergence, and map this to the GLC. Going one step further, we take a morphometric terrain approach to visualizing and understanding differences between lineages. In summary, we argue that while generalized frameworks may work well for concepts of what species are, plurality and \xe2\x80\x98inclusive\xe2\x80\x99 probabilistic approaches may work best for delimitation.'

Abstract: 'Samples of the spotted murrel (Channa punctatus) were collected from three rivers of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The allozyme variation of C. punctatus was investigated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Eighteen enzymes were detected, but only 10 (EST, PGM, G3PDH, G6PDH, SOD, GPI, ODH, GDH, XDH, and CK) showed consistent phenotypic variations. Allele frequencies were estimated at the 18 polymorphic loci representing 10 enzymes. Two rare alleles, EST-4*C and G6PDH-2*C, were noted in the Tamirabarani and Kallada populations but were absent in the Siruvani population. The allele frequencies of the Tamirabarani and Kallada populations were similar, except for a few loci. Among the three populations, the maximum genetic distance (0.026) and FST (0.203) were found between the geographically distant Siruvani and Kallada populations. Overall the study showed that among the three populations, the Tamirabarani and Kallada have similar genetic structures.'

Abstract: 'UNESCO Natural World Heritage Sites (WHSs) are some of the most important biophysical and geological places on Earth, yet nearly half are endangered or face considerable risks from ever-expanding human impacts. Often sites have people living within or nearby who speak different languages, many of which are unique and similarly endangered. Here we examine the co-occurrence of Natural WHSs with languages, as a key index of cultural diversity, to identify locations for integrative conservation opportunities aimed at protecting human and non-human diversity. Our analysis reveals many WHSs with high linguistic diversity, as well as endangered sites with associated indigenous languages and endangered languages that intersect Natural WHSs. Results identify Australia as the continent which has the greatest number of Natural WHSs, many co-occurring with highly endangered languages. Engaging speakers of indigenous languages often can help maintain nature, while efforts to conserve Natural WHSs can help preserve settings that enabled indigenous languages and cultures to emerge and persist.'

Abstract: 'To characterize the genetic diversity of present populations of Symplocos laurina, which grow in the montane forests in India, we analyzed the DNA sequences of a nuclear gene. Using the 881\xc2\xa0bp sequence of cytosolic Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, we detected 24 haplotypes among 195 individuals sampled from 14 populations. Two dominant haplotypes were distributed over the entire range of this species in India and several private haplotypes were found. Low genetic diversity within population, high differentiation, number of population specific haplotypes and deviation from neutral evolution characterized the present populations of S. laurina. An analysis of molecular variance indicated the presence of geographic structure within the haplotype distribution. The occurrence of S. laurina preglaciation in India is the most parsimonious explanation for the current geographic structure observed. The populations are presumably ancient and might have spread across its extant distribution range in India through a recent range expansion event.'

Abstract: 'Present study deals with the vegetation type mapping, structure and composition analysis of the tropical forests, spread over 1,294 km2 area in South Andaman Islands. Seventeen vegetation classes spreading over 89.92% forested area of the islands were mapped with the overall accuracy of 88.89%. Evergreen, semi-evergreen and mangrove forests were reasonably well distributed forests, while moist deciduous and littoral evergreen were narrowly restricted. The stocking was quite variable across the forest types. 60.04% of forested area was under medium to high canopy density. Secondary and degraded forest types were mapped. Information on floristic composition, structure and diversity of various forest types were obtained from 84 field sample plots. An inventory of 423 species of plants from 101 families included 155 trees, 84 shrubs, 150 herbs and 84 climbers. Tree density and mean basal area ranged from 517 to 900 stems ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 36.15 to 53.58 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921 respectively. Evergreen forests accounted for highest diversity followed almost equally by semi-evergreen and moist deciduous forests.'

Abstract: 'The Bandipur National Park situated in the Western Ghats of Karnataka State, is one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. During recent years, this park has witnessed repeated fires, affecting considerable areas under vegetation. The temporal satellite data from 1997 to 2006 have been analyzed to map the burnt areas using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. The vegetation cover is moist deciduous, dry deciduous, scrub forests and teak plantation. Information on extent of the burnt areas and the type of vegetation affected were derived forest range-wise. The fire prone regions have been identified by integrating vegetation type/density, road and settlement network and past history of forest fire occurrence, by assigning subjective weightage according to their fire-inducing capability or their sensitivity to fire. Comparison between each temporal dataset in terms of the extent of burnt area was also carried out to interpret fire incidence pattern. Three categories of fire risk regions such as Low, Moderate and High fire intensity zones were identified and it was found that almost 40% of the study area falls under low risk zone. An evaluation of the existing fire management systems and the implication of fire prevention programmes has been discussed, besides an assessment of causal factors for fire incidence in the park.'

Title: 'Convention on Biological Diversity: a review of national challenges and opportunities for implementation'

Abstract: 'The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) lies at the heart of biodiversity conservation initiatives. It offers opportunities to address global issues at the national level through locally grown solutions and measures. This article reviews the national challenges and opportunities in meeting requirements of the CBD by analysing twenty Third National Reports (TNRs), covering five different CBD regional clusters from the three global economic groups. While there is a plethora of challenges, the predominant ones discussed in this study include: institutional and capacity, knowledge and accessible information, economic policy and financial resources, cooperation and stakeholder involvement, and mainstreaming and integration of biodiversity. The underlying problem is that limited capacity in developing countries and transition economies undermines conservation initiatives. Lack of capacity in science, coordination, administration, legislation, and monitoring are barriers to on-ground implementation of biodiversity programmes. Opportunities to overcome these challenges embrace use of knowledge products, information-sharing mechanisms, participatory platforms, educational programmes, multi-level governance, and policy coherence. Innovative market-based instruments are also being trialled in various countries, which seek to offer incentives to local communities. The article concludes that conservation measures should be supported by multiple sectors and secure high level political support. Political, economical, and legislative sectors are more likely to show interest in CBD implementation and use it as a tool for managing biodiversity when they know the Convention processes and perceive it as a benefit. Modest investments in capacity building and training, and engaging different sectors in setting priorities would have a significant pay-off.'

Title: 'Deep RNA-Seq profile reveals biodiversity, plant\xe2\x80\x93microbe interactions and a large family of NBS-LRR resistance genes in walnut (Juglans regia) tissues'

Abstract: 'Deep RNA-Seq profiling, a revolutionary method used for quantifying transcriptional levels, often includes non-specific transcripts from other co-existing organisms in spite of stringent protocols. Using the recently published walnut genome sequence as a filter, we present a broad analysis of the RNA-Seq derived transcriptome profiles obtained from twenty different tissues to extract the biodiversity and possible plant\xe2\x80\x93microbe interactions in the walnut ecosystem in California. Since the residual nature of the transcripts being analyzed does not provide sufficient information to identify the exact strain, inferences made are constrained to the genus level. The presence of the pathogenic oomycete Phytophthora was detected in the root through the presence of a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Cryptococcus, the causal agent of cryptococcosis, was found in the catkins and vegetative buds, corroborating previous work indicating that the plant surface supported the sexual cycle of this human pathogen. The RNA-Seq profile revealed several species of the endophytic nitrogen fixing Actinobacteria. Another bacterial species implicated in aerobic biodegradation of methyl tert-butyl ether (Methylibium petroleiphilum) is also found in the root. RNA encoding proteins from the pea aphid were found in the leaves and vegetative buds, while a serine protease from mosquito with significant homology to a female reproductive tract protease from Drosophila mojavensis in the vegetative bud suggests egg-laying activities. The comprehensive analysis of RNA-seq data present also unraveled detailed, tissue-specific information of ~400 transcripts encoded by the largest family of resistance (R) genes (NBS-LRR), which possibly rationalizes the resistance of the specific walnut plant to the pathogens detected. Thus, we elucidate the biodiversity and possible plant\xe2\x80\x93microbe interactions in several walnut (Juglans regia) tissues in California using deep RNA-Seq profiling.'

Abstract: 'The occurrence of forest fire in India, and their interrelationship with causal drivers i.e. climate (temperature, rainfall, dry-days, El Ni\xc3\xb1o), fuel status (forest types, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) and anthropogenic disturbances (distance from road and settlements, population density) were investigated. The Nino3 sea surface temperature index was used based on sea surface temperature anomalies recorded from February to June (fire season in India) through the years 2003\xe2\x80\x932013. This was used as the representative index of El Ni\xc3\xb1o southern oscillations (ENSO). The correlations among different causal drivers and fire occurrence were investigated for the entire country and different bio-geographic zones within the country. In India, the forest fire were significantly (significance f\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05, confidence interval 95%) correlated with average dry-days (r 0.75) and maximum average temperature (r 0.76). It was further observed that El Ni\xc3\xb1o increased the temperature and consequently the dryness, which created conducive conditions for fire to occur. The integrated fire frequency ratio, which is the ratio of percent of total fire occurrence in a particular driver class to the percent of total area of that driver class, was estimated for each year from 2003 to 2013 to investigate the fire susceptibility of different forests. The yearly fire frequency ratio was estimated to understand the dynamics of fire susceptibility across the country. The fire occurrence in Deccan Peninsula and the central Himalayas in particular were found to be more sensitive towards the climate anomalies.'

Abstract: 'The freshwater resources of India are currently experiencing an alarming decline in fish biodiversity due to several factors and as a result, a sizeable portion of fresh water fishes have been categorized as threatened. This emphasizes an immediate need for initiating research and actions for alternative management techniques to protect these aquatic systems. One such option that has potential to protect freshwater ecosystem from numerous threats is the creation of freshwater aquatic sanctuary (FAS) within protected area network. Though similar conservation practices are well established in the terrestrial and marine ecosystem, however, the work on freshwater systems has been very slow and negligible. In the present communication we conceptualized the need and approach for developing FAS within the protected area network based on our observations in the water bodies of the selected wildlife sanctuaries in Northern India as well as success stories of some other countries. In this study we assessed the fish diversity in the selected protected areas of Northern India. The assessment indicated that these sanctuaries harbor 28.26\xe2\x80\x9331.13% of freshwater fishes, which are threatened in other areas. Apart from Indian Major Carps, Tor putitora, Chitala chitala, Pangasius pangasius, Clupisoma gerua, Ailia coila, Aorichthys aor, Wallago attu, Rhinomugil corsula, Ompok pabda, Ombok pabo etc. were the important species encountered in the protected waters. The various issues related to FAS including objectives, approach, potential tools, implementation and management are discussed towards saving endangered fish germplasm resources. Approaches, tools and modus operandi proposed in this communication could be utilized by other developing countries in the region.'

Abstract: 'In vitro techniques have found increasing use in the conservation of threatened plants in recent years and this trend is likely to continue as more species face risk of extinction. The Micropropagation Unit at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, UK (RBG Kew) has an extensive collection of in vitro plants including many threatened species from throughout the world. The long history of the unit and the range of plants cultured have enabled considerable expertise to be amassed in identifying the problems and developing experimental strategies for propagation and conservation of threatened plants. While a large body of knowledge is available on the in vitro culture of plants, there are limited publications relating to threatened plant conservation. This review highlights the progress in in vitro culture and conservation of threatened plants in the past decade (1995\xe2\x80\x932005) and suggests future research directions. Works on non-threatened plants are also included wherever methods have applications in rare plant conservation. Recalcitrant plant materials collected from the wild or ex situ collections are difficult to grow in culture. Different methods of sterilization and other treatments to establish clean material for culture initiation are reviewed. Application of different culture methods for multiplication, and use of unconventional materials for rooting and transplantation are reviewed. As the available plant material for culture initiation is scarce and in many cases associated with inherent problems such as low viability and endogenous contamination, reliable protocols on multiplication, rooting, and storage methods are very important. In this context, photoautotrophic micropropagation has the potential for development as a routine method for the in vitro conservation of endangered plants. Long-term storage of material in culture is challenging and the potential applications of cryopreservation are significant in this area. Future conservation biotechnology research and its applications must be aimed at conserving highly threatened, mainly endemic, plants from conservation hotspots.'

Abstract: 'We studied extent and type of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and septate endophytic (SE) fungal associations in five lycophytes and 50 ferns collected from Eastern and Western Ghats regions. Of the 54 species and one variety (belonging to 31 genera) examined; 54 taxa had AM association and AM fungal structures were absent in Marsilea quadrifolia. This is the first report of AM and SE fungal status for 26 species each. Of the 55 taxa examined, AM morphology has been evaluated for the first time in 51 species. The hydrophytic fern Salvinia molesta was mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal at different sites. All the epiphytic and saxicolous species examined were mycorrhizal. The percentage of AM colonization ranged from 22.23 (Christella parasitica) to 82.20 (Adiantum lunulatum) in ferns and 53.46 (Selaginella bryopteris) to 84.34 (Selaginella sp.) in lycophytes. Epiphytic life-forms had the maximum average AM colonization levels, whereas aquatic life-forms had the minimum colonization levels. The percentage root length colonized by septate fungi ranged between 0.59 in Ophioglossum reticulatum and 16.36 in Pteris pellucida. The root length with AM and SE fungal structures as well as their total colonization significantly varied among the taxa examined. Most of the lycophytes and ferns had intermediate-type of AM morphology with a few exhibiting Paris-type. AM fungal spore numbers ranged from 1.0 (Angiopteris evecta, Pteridium aquilinum) to (Nephrolepis exaltata) 9.3 spores per 25\xc2\xa0g soil and varied significantly among taxa. AM fungal spore morphotypes belonging to Claroideoglomus, Funneliformis, Glomus and Rhizophagus were recorded.'

Abstract: 'India is home to thousands of community-protected forests, called sacred groves. Sacred forests or groves are sites that have cultural or spiritual significance to the people who live around them. These areas may also be key reservoirs of biodiversity. In India, most sacred groves are managed by a community group, not by a government agency. They are often private or community land, not formal protected areas or parks. This poses an interesting challenge in terms of future management and possible policy relating to the sacred groves. On the international level, organizations such as the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and UNESCO have created guidelines for management of sacred sites. On the national level, India\xe2\x80\x99s past Forest Acts and recent Forest Rights Act have relevance to the sacred groves. Local differences in land tenure also affect the groves. Ethnographic research conducted in 2009 and 2010 in the states of Meghalaya and Karnataka, India, evaluated the historic and current management and beliefs associated with sacred forests. Cultural change and pressure to use natural resources within the groves is leading to reduction of these forest areas. In the future, a creative combination of policy approaches to conserve groves that respects their spiritual values is recommended.'

Abstract: 'Seven accessions of the underutilized legume, Cassia hirsuta L., seeds collected from seven different agroclimatic regions of Tamil Nadu, India, were analyzed for proximate composition, total proteins, protein fractions, mineral profiles and selected antinutritional factors. Crude protein ranged from 15.52 to 20.74%, crude lipid 3.77\xe2\x80\x937.04%, crude fiber4.68\xe2\x80\x936.92%, ash 3.98\xe2\x80\x936.42% and carbohydrates 62.45\xe2\x80\x9370.16%. Energyvalues of the seeds were 1549\xe2\x80\x931634 kJ/100 g (DM), which are comparable to those of other legumes. Data on seed protein fractions revealed thatglobulins constituted the bulk of the seed protein as in most legumes. Mineralcontents of the seeds showed greater variation. Potassium was the mostabundant mineral (1029\xe2\x80\x931786 mg/100 g), whereas manganese was low (2.1\xe2\x80\x932.2 mg/100 g). Antinutritional factors such as total free phenolics,tannins, L-DOPA and lectins were analyzed. The results of the studydemonstrated that the accessions of C. hirsuta seeds collectedfrom Tamil Nadu, India, could be good sources of some important nutrientsfor humans.'

Abstract: 'The present study were made to estimate the avian fauna in terms of species richness and diversity and guild structure in forest habitats of Nainital district of Uttarakhand (350\xe2\x80\x932.450 m asl; 29\xc2\xb0 N). Field studies were conducted during January 2007 to December 2008. Total 43, 62 and 42 species were recorded from, Haldwani, Bhowali and Nainital forest habitats. Results indicate the species relationship between Bird species richness (BSR) and elevation sections (forest habitats) was not decline simultaneously along elevation; it shows hump shaped. BSR varied considerably along elevational gradient (43 to 62 species), was highest (62 species) at mid elevation (Mixed pine forest, 1.350\xe2\x80\x931.700 m asl) and decreased (20 species) at high elevation (Conifer forest, 1900\xe2\x80\x932450 m asl). It seems that mid altitude bulge is not caused by the presence of a group of mid altitude specialists but rather that there is an overlap in the distribution of low land and high elevation specialists at this altitude. A checklist of 79 avian species has also produced of Nainital district forest habitats. It is suggested that this study provide a base line structure for further study on species distribution in different forest habitats and along different elevation section in Western Himalayas (India).'

Abstract: 'Identifying the factors that contribute to species distribution will help determine the impact of the changing climate on species\xe2\x80\x99 range contraction and expansion. Ecological niche modelling is used to analyze the present and potential future distribution of rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) in two biogeographically distinct regions of India i.e., the Western Ghats (WG) and Northeast (NE). The rubber tree is an economically important plantation species, and therefore factors other than climate may play a significant role in determining its occurrence. To assist in future planning, we used the maximum entropy model to predict plausible areas for the expansion of rubber tree plantations under a changing climate scenario. Inclusion of elevation, soil and socioeconomic factors into the model did not result in a significant increase in the model accuracy estimates over the bioclimatic model (AUC\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.92), but their effect was pronounced in the predicted probability scoring of species occurrence. Among various factors, elevation, rooting condition, village population and agricultural labour availability contributed substantially to the model in the NE region, whereas for the WG region, climate was the most important contributing factor for rubber tree distribution. We found that more areas would be suitable for rubber tree plantation in the NE region, whereas further expansion would be limited in the WG region under the projected climate scenario for 2050.'

Abstract: 'Since the first report on Camptothecin detection in Nothapodytes nimmoniana by Govindachari and Viswanathan (Phytochem 11:35\xe2\x80\x9329, 1972), considerable work has been done on biotechnology and its applications on the species. Plant tissue culture techniques have applications in clonal propagation, CPT production, and conservation of N. nimmoniana. Discovery of CPT production by endophytes existing in symbiotic association with N. nimmoniana has provided new insights into finding alternative sources of the alkaloid. Development of molecular markers such as RFLP, RAPD, ISSR, and AFLP has facilitated understanding of population ecology and genetics of the species. Molecular information generated from these studies is promising in establishing strategies for conservation and sustainable use of N. nimmoniana populations under overexploitation pressure. The advances in instrumentation in the 20th century, such as desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry allowed CPT analysis in tissues without sample pretreatment. Other ancient techniques for qualitative and quantitative analysis such as chromatography, spectroscopy, and H1-NMR are applied in the detection of CPT due to variable sensitivity to the alkaloid. The review covers work on plant tissue culture for clonal propagation and CPT production in N. nimmoniana. Besides symbiotic endophyte sources of CPT in N. nimmoniana, population genetics studies and instrumentation analysis of the alkaloids are reviewed.'

Title: 'Measuring biological heterogeneity of forest vegetation types: avalanche index as an estimate of biological diversity'

Abstract: 'Ideally, the estimates of biological diversity of a community of species in a habitat should refer to the biological variation among the species and not merely to their numbers and frequencies. However, the current estimates of biodiversity incorporate only the latter two components but not the biological differences among the species. Ganeshaiah et al. [(1997) Current Science 73: 128\xe2\x80\x93133] have proposed an estimate called the Avalanche Index (AI) that can incorporate the biological heterogeneity among the species in a habitat. This estimate, besides being methodologically simple, can incorporate any quantifiable differences among the species, information on species richness and their frequencies in the habitat. In this paper we have estimated AI for tree vegetation in 14 forest types across different ecosystems of the world and have compared these estimates with other indices being currently used. Through this we have attempted to analyse the relative utility of AI in discriminating the habitats based on their biological heterogeneity by capturing their intra-community biological variation. We discuss the merits and demerits of the AI as a comprehensive estimate of biological diversity.'

Abstract: 'In the foreseeable future there is little likelihood of achieving consensus on the number of Asian primate genera and species, and their subspecific composition. There is a more realistic hope of reaching agreement on the number of recognizable subspecies. The latter objective is more urgent because in order to reliably assess generic and specific numbers, it is essential that effective conservation measures are implemented for as many subspecies as possible. This cannot be comprehensively accomplished until their validity is assessed and they are satisfactorily established and defined. The Asian primate classification that we present is the outcome of electronic communication among the co-authors after a workshop, which was especially convened to attempt to determine the number of recognizable primate subspecies and to identify potentially recognizable subspecies. The generic and specific arrangement is a compromise that does not necessarily reflect the individual views of the co-authors: 183 subspecies in 77 species in 16 genera. The 31 subspecies allotted a low credibility rating are almost balanced by the 22 scientifically unnamed populations that may warrant subspecific status.'

Abstract: 'A cascade of reviews and growing body of literature exists on forest invasion ecology, its mechanism or causes; however, no review addressed the sustainable management of invasive plants of forest in totality. Henceforth, the present paper aims to provide a critical review on the management of invasive species particularly in the context of forest plants. Plant invasion in forest is now increasingly being recognized as a global problem, and various continents are adversely affected, although to a differential scale. Quest for the ecological mechanism lying behind the success of invasive species over native species of forest has drawn the attention of researches worldwide particularly in the context of diversity\xe2\x80\x93stability relationship. Transport, colonization, establishment, and landscape spread may be different steps in success of invasive plants in forest, and each and every step is checked through several ecological attributes. Further, several ecological attribute and hypothesis (enemy release, novel weapon, empty niche, evolution of increased competitive ability, etc.) were proposed pertaining to success of invasive plant species in forest ecosystems. However, a single theory will not be able to account for invasion success among all environments as it may vary spatially and temporally. Therefore, in order to formulate a sustainable management plan for invasive plants of forest, it is necessary to develop a synoptic view of the dynamic processes involved in the invasion process. Moreover, invasive species of forest can act synergistically with other elements of global change, including land-use change, climate change, increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and nitrogen deposition. Henceforth, a unified framework for biological invasions that reconciles and integrates the key features of the most commonly used invasion frameworks into a single conceptual model that can be applied to all human-mediated invasions.'

Title: 'Ecology of an endemic primate species (Macaca siberu) on Siberut Island, Indonesia'

Abstract: 'Logging and forest loss continues to be a major problem within Southeast Asia and as a result, many species are becoming threatened or extinct. The present study provides the first detailed and comprehensive ecological data on the Siberut macaque (Macaca siberu), a primate species living exclusively on the island of Siberut off the west coast of Sumatra. Our results show that M. siberu is ecologically similar to its closest relative M. nemestrina occurring on the mainland, both species being semi-terrestrial, mainly frugivorous (75-76%), exhibit a large daily travel distance for their group size and spend more time on traveling than any other macaque species. The habitat of Siberut macaques was floristically very diverse (Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s index D=0.97), although somewhat impoverished in tree species richness, and had a lower tree basal area and a lower rattan density compared to other forests in Malesia (both rattan and palm tree fruit being an important food resource for Macaca siberu due to their long fruiting periods). These factors may lead to a lower diversity and abundance of fruit resources, and coupled with a high degree of frugivory of Siberut macaques, may explain the large amount of traveling observed in this species. The large home range requirements and strong dependence on fruit are important factors that need to be considered when developing conservation measures for this IUCN-listed (Category Vulnerable) species.'

Abstract: 'Different human societies have different biodiversity around them; there is diversity in their food habits, ailments, occupations, daily routine, social customs, needs, and notions about natural phenomena. They have different domestic animals, and consequently, different veterinary diseases to manage. These circumstances have given rise to very diverse experiences among indigenous societies about plant wealth around them. Over generations, this has made very rich additions to the interrelationships between man and plant wealth around him. Faith, tradition, taboos and several such associations with forests and particular plant species have helped in conservation of plant diversity. The richness of plant diversity in any area, is not evaluated merely by the number of species occurring there, but by the intensity of associations and dependence of the indigenous communities on that plant wealth. Respect for this indigenous knowledge, and relationship helps in conservation.'

Title: 'Extinction threat evaluation of endemic fig trees of New Caledonia: Priority assessment for taxonomy and conservation with herbarium collections'
Author: 'Stefan\xc2\xa0Ungricht'

Abstract: 'This article focuses on the relationship between priority-setting in conservation and in taxonomy. A simple and generally applicable scheme is presented based on prior quantitative extinction threat evaluation. In the main part of the study we describe the assessment of the herbarium voucher collection date time series of 21 endemic fig tree species of Ficus sect. Oreosycea (Moraceae). The fig tree assessment is then compared with the available IUCN Red List data and with the collection information on two other groups of endemic tree radiations in New Caledonia: ebonies of Diospyros sect. Maba (Ebenaceae) and the Iguanura palm lineage (Arecaceae). We find a remarkably low level of extinction threat evident in Ficus but a pronounced need to differentiate between true species rarity and putative rarity of potential taxonomic artifacts. To this end it is proposed how such numerical evaluations can be used to set future priorities for the assessment or validation of the taxonomic and conservation status of taxa. The limitations and implications of the evaluation are discussed and relevant criteria for a meaningful analysis of collection records are listed. Finally, putting our results on woody plants into perspective, we briefly review the general conservation situation and outlook of New Caledonia, acknowledging both its high conservation priority and potential.'

Abstract: 'The diversity of Indian lichen flora has undergone a considerable decline in the last five decades. Among the various anthropogenic activities, overexploitation and selective removal of economically important lichens have become major threats to the lichen flora of the country. Commercial samples of lichens collected from different states of India were studied for their source and commercial use. Among samples offered for sale, 38 different lichen species were identified. The western Himalayas proved to be the main area for lichen collection, while some lichen species also come from the central and Western Ghats. Local traders coordinate the lichen collection and then sell the material to traders in the foothills, and from there it is processed and distributed to other parts of the country and abroad. Because lichens belonging to the families Parmeliaceae and Physciaceae are the ones most exploited commercially, they are recommended for inclusion in the CITES list.'

Title: 'Molecular systematics of Indian Crotalaria (Fabaceae) based on analyses of nuclear ribosomal ITS DNA sequences'

Abstract: ' Crotalaria L. (Fabaceae) comprises approximately 700 species that are distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. In India, it is the largest legume genus with 92 species. Sequences of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer from species representing all the six recognized sections of Indian Crotalaria were subjected to phylogenetic analyses. Ancestral state reconstructions were done for two morphological characters, corolla keel beak, and leaf form. Analyses reveal five major well-supported clades within a monophyletic Crotalaria. Clade 1 has members with rostrate-spirally twisted keel beaks while the remaining four clades comprise members with keel beaks rostrate-not spirally twisted. Clade 1 further bifurcates into two clades characterized by differences in leaf morphology: (1a) contains species with simple leaves belonging to section Calycinae, section Crotalaria subsection Crotalaria and subsection Bractetae and multifoliolate leaves belonging to section Crotalaria subsection Polyphyllae (1b) contains species with trifoliate leaves belonging to section Dispermae, section Crotalaria subsection Longirostres. Sub-clade iii in Clade 1a contains four species complexes, each forming a monophyletic group. Of these one comprising C. madurensis, C. subperfoliata, C. shevaroyensis, and C. longipes is endemic to a region in southern India. Each of the others contains one endemic species and one widespread species that is sympatric with the endemic one (C. hirta and C.mysorensis; C. epunctata and C. albida; C. clarkei and C. triquetra). The present study suggests that: (1) all members of section Calycinae and most members of section Crotalaria form a clade, (2) members of section Crotalaria subsection Longirostres and section Dispermae form a distinct clade, (3) twisting of the keel beak is an apomorphy within the genus, (4) there is a reversal to keel beak rostrate-not spirally twisted in C. shevaroyensis and an independent origin of a rostrate-spirally twisted keel beak in C. humilis, and (5) the trifoliolate condition is a plesiomorphy in the genus and the simple leaf condition an apomorphy; there is a single reversal to the trifoliolate condition in C. orixensis. The current morphological classification system of Indian Crotalaria species includes six sections, but these circumscriptions are not supported by the molecular data.'

Abstract: 'In recent years considerable attention has been paid to the notion of \xe2\x80\x98market creation\xe2\x80\x99 for the conservation of environmental assets. Market creation establishes a market in the external benefit or cost in question (e.g. biodiversity or pollution reduction) and leaves the relevant parties to adjust their behaviour accordingly. While most attention has been paid to market creation through tradable permits and taxes (the \xe2\x80\x98polluter-pays\xe2\x80\x99), it is less easy to secure a perspective on \xe2\x80\x98beneficiary-pays\xe2\x80\x99 initiatives. Both polluter-pays and beneficiary-pays initiatives are examples of modified Coaseian bargains in which governments intervene in the bargains to lower transactions costs, establish property rights, deal with public goods issues, or act on behalf of disadvantaged groups. This paper reviews four major initiatives in this respect - debt-for-nature swaps, bioprospecting and the Global Environment Facility at the global level, and the Costa Rican Forest Law at the local level. It finds that while there is much to applaud in initiatives in these new markets, serious questions remain about the modest flows of funds associated with such \xe2\x80\x98global bargains\xe2\x80\x99, and the extent to which they secure environmental improvements relative to the baseline of business-as-usual.'

Abstract: 'Western Ghats of India is recognized as one of the 12 mega diversity regions of the world and is the hot spot for unrevealed microbial diversity. To explore the diversity of polysaccharide degrading enzymes in that region, metagenomic library was constructed from forest soil of Southern Western Ghats region. Nine pectinolytic clones with the ability to degrade citrus pectin were isolated based on function based screening of the library. Sequence analysis of pg_4\xc2\xa0clone\xc2\xa0containing revealed that it contained GH family 28 domain (pfam00295) belonging to polygalacturonase superfamily (PLN03003). Its amino acid sequence analysis showed 25\xe2\x80\x9355\xc2\xa0% identity to the other well-characterized polygalacturonases. Molecular modeling of pg_4 revealed that it comprised of three right handed-parallel \xce\xb2 sheets, one anti-parallel \xce\xb2 sheet and one \xce\xb1 helix with three conserved catalytic residue D 2263, D 284-85 and H 312 at the C terminal end.

Abstract: "Forest gardens are reconstructed natural forests, in which wild and cultivated plants coexist, such that the structural characteristics and ecological processes of natural forests are preserved, although the species composition has been adapted to suit human needs. These agroforests include a range of modified and transformed forests, and form an integral part of local land-use systems. They lie between natural forests and tree-crop plantations in terms of their structure and composition, and low intensity of forest extraction systems and the high intensity plantation systems in terms of their management intensity. Their management is characterized by combined use of silvicultural and horticultural operations, and spatial and temporal variations. These ecologically sustainable systems are often dynamic in species composition in response to changing socioeconomic conditions. Evolved over a long period of time as a result of local community's creativity, forest gardens have still received little attention in agroforestry research, just as in the case of the more intensively domesticated homegardens. The study of forest gardens offers good opportunities for obtaining a better understanding of the \xe2\x80\x98nature-analogous\xe2\x80\x99 agroforestry systems and for developing multifunctional agroforestry systems combining production and biodiversity values."

Abstract: 'The use of paddock trees by birds was assessed in a grazinglandscape in southern New South Wales, Australia. Seventy paddock treesites were surveyed for 20 min each in the morning, and 36sites were surveyed again at midday in March 2000. During this time, thepresence and abundance of birds was recorded. Several site and landscapevariables were measured at each site. These included tree species, atree size index, a measure of the crown cover density around the site,and proximity to the nearest woodland patch. During formal surveys, 31bird species, including several woodland species, were observed usingpaddock trees. Data from bird surveys in woodland patches that wereobtained in a separate study in November 1999 were used to comparewhether there was a relationship between the abundance of a given birdspecies in woodland patches and paddock trees. Many birds commonlydetected in woodland patches were also common in paddock trees. However,some birds with special habitat requirements were absent from paddocktrees although they were common in woodland patches. Site occupancypatterns were modelled for several guilds of birds using logisticregression. Foliage-foraging birds were more likely to occupy clumps oftrees and sites with a high tree size index. Nectarivores appeared to bemore likely to be detected at sites more than 200 m fromwoodland, although this result was marginally non-significant(P = 0.08). The probability of detecting granivoreswas higher at sites with a low tree size index. Open country specieswere most likely to occupy large trees and sites that were located morethan 200 m from the nearest woodland patch. The value ofpaddock trees may have been underestimated in the past because a widevariety of bird species use paddock trees on a regular basis. Ensuringthe continued survival of paddock trees should be an important aspect offuture conservation and revegetation efforts.'

Abstract: 'The paper provides an overview of the developments in hydrobiological studies in India during the past fifty years, and links them with a historical perspective of the pre-independence studies. Hydrobiological studies which were well developed in the beginning of this century, gained momentum soon after independence as all kinds of aquatic habitats were investigated for the assessment, conservation and optimum utilization of inland fishery resources of the country. However, the environmental issues which dominated since the 1972 Stockholm Conference, and growing realization of the problem of water pollution, resulted in a rapid proliferation of hydrobiological studies which tend to focus on correlation between the distribution of various organisms and degree of water pollution or the effects of various organic and inorganic pollutants. A sampling of published literature reveals that long-term, analytical and experimental studies of the whole ecosystems (natural or experimental), and studies of population interactions, biomanipulation, food chain dynamics, and energy flows are wholly lacking. The paper calls for the strengthening of field and laboratory facilities, and establishment of regional and national institutes of aquatic ecology which will be necessary for the management of both the water quality and aquatic biological resources for sustainable development.'

Abstract: 'Four samples of freshwater alga Sirodotia (class Rhodophyceae) collected from two distinct streams in the Mahabaleshwar, Satara district (1,732\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0a.s.l.) of the Western Ghats of Maharashtra (India) were analysed for their fatty acid content. The presence of 32 fatty acids was revealed, of which 13 were saturated (SFA), 8 were monounsaturated (MUFA) and 11 were polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids. The major finding was the presence of three pharmaceutically and neutraceutically important PUFAs: arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentanoeic acid (EPA), and docosahexanoiec acid (DHA). The major fatty acids identified were palmitic (16:0), cis-11,14 icodienoic (20:2), behenic (22:0), cis-8,11,14 eicosatrienoic(20:3n6), cis-4,7,10,13,16,19 docosahexanoeic (22:6n3), cis-13,16 docosadienoic (22:2), erucic (22:1n9), -5,8,11,14,17 eicosapentaenoic (20:5n3), trichosonoic (23:0), nervonic (24:0), arachidonic (20:4n6), cis-10 pentadecanoic (15:1), cis-11,14,17 eicosatrienoic (20:3n3), and myristic acid (14:0). The total PUFA contents ranged from 31.45 to 40.37%. The fatty acids were characterised by the relatively high abundance of PUFAs, while C20 unsaturated acids were appreciably more abundant than C18 unsaturated acids. This is the first report on fatty acid profiles of the genus Sirodotia. '

Abstract: 'Demand for new environmental services from forests requires improved monitoring of these services at three scales: project-, regional-, and national-level. Most forest management activities are organized at the project scale, while the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) recognizes the nation as the party to the agreement. Hence, measurement and monitoring issues are emerging at the intersections of the project and national scales, referred to here as monitoring-domain edge effects. The following actions are necessary to improve existing monitoring capabilities and to help resolve project/national edge effects: (1) consensus on standard methods and protocols for monitoring mitigation activities, their off-site greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts, the fate of forest products and their relation to national GHG inventories (baselines); (2) a global program for collecting land use, land cover, biomass burning, and other data essential for national baselines; (3) the development of new nested-monitoring-domain methods that allow projects to be identified in national GHG inventories (baselines), and permit tracking of leakage of GHGs and wood product flows outside project boundary and over time; and (4) presentation of a set of credible, carefully designed, and well-documented forest mitigation activities that resolve most of the current issues.'

Abstract: 'Wildlife reserves are becoming increasingly isolated from the surrounding human-dominated landscapes particularly in Asia. It is imperative to understand how species are distributed spatially and temporally in and outside reserves, and what factors influence their occurrence. This study surveyed 7500\xc2\xa0km2 landscape surrounding five reserves in the Western Ghats to examine patterns of occurrence of five herbivores: elephant, gaur, sambar, chital, and pig. Species distributions are modeled spatio-temporally using an occupancy approach. Trained field teams conducted 3860 interview-based occupancy surveys in a 10-km buffer surrounding these five reserves in 2012. I found gaur and wild pig to be the least and most wide-ranging species, respectively. Elephant and chital exhibit seasonal differences in spatial distribution unlike the other three species. As predicted, distance to reserve, the reserve itself, and forest cover were associated with higher occupancy of all species, and higher densities of people negatively influenced occurrence of all species. Park management, species protection, and conflict mitigation efforts in this landscape need to incorporate temporal and spatial understanding of species distributions. All species are known crop raiders and conflict prone locations with resources (such as water and forage) have to be monitored and managed carefully. Wildlife reserves and adjacent areas are critical for long-term persistence and habitat use for all five herbivores and must be monitored to ensure wildlife can move freely. Such a large-scale approach to map and monitor species distributions can be adapted to other landscapes to identify and monitor critical habitats shared by people and wildlife.'

Abstract: 'The historical collections in herbaria are increasingly used for documentation of biodiversity. The use of herbarium reconstruction in the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot, using a case study from Srinagar city in Kashmir Himalaya has been shown. During the present investigation, a comprehensive and updated biodiversity database of 937 plant taxa has been developed, which is based on expert investigation of ca. 45,000 plant specimens deposited in the herbarium of University of Kashmir, and careful supplementation of field records in the study area made over the last one decade. The results indicate a clear dominance of herbaceous growth form as 602 species were herbs. Majority of the plant species possess perennial life span, as 610 plant species fall under this category. Inspite of being a rapidly urbanising centre, Srinagar city owing to its location in the global biodiversity hotspot of Himalayas exhibits a clear dominance of wild-growing plant species. In the database, 20 species fall under different threat categories. The present study is the documentation of plant biodiversity of this eco-fragile mountainous region and clearly demonstrates the precious value of biological collections in bridging the knowledge gaps in global biodiversity hotspots, including Himalayas. Looking ahead, the biodiversity database can serve as a baseline in the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity; and more importantly, the database can provide the reference framework in assessing and monitoring the impending impacts of land use and climate change on the biodiversity of this Himalayan city.'

Title: 'Ecology and Impacts of the Invasive Species, Lantana camara, in a Social-Ecological System in South India: Perspectives from Local Knowledge'

Abstract: 'We explored how the forest-dwelling Soliga community of South India views and explains biological invasions, and how local knowledge can inform scientific knowledge on biological invasions. We used an interview schedule with open-ended questions to solicit Soliga opinion on Lantana camara (lantana) invasion. The Soliga cited three reasons for lantana spread: its prolific fruit output and wide seed dispersal, change in fire management, and historical extraction of grass and bamboo. The Soliga believe that lantana invasion has had negative effects on the ecosystem and their livelihoods. Tabling scientific knowledge with local knowledge has improved our understanding of lantana invasion. The role of existing lantana in colonizing neighboring areas, and the response of native tree communities to lantana were common to both local and scientific sources. However, the Soliga view provides a more nuanced perspective of the lantana-fire relationship (contextually based on lantana density) with fires suppressing lantana when lantana density was low. This is contrary to views held by foresters and biologists, that fires are uniformly detrimental and promote lantana. Our study shows that examining Soliga observations has improved understanding of the invasion process and presents avenues for future lantana management.'

Abstract: 'The effects of invasive species on community structure remain under-investigated due to the lack of long-term data. Our objectives were to examine the correlation between Lantana camara L. invasion and native species abundance, distribution, diversity, and population structure, across different forest types in a heterogeneous landscape. We examined changes in native vegetation and L. camara between 1997 and 2008. We used existing vegetation data from 134 plots spread across the 540 km2 landscape from 1997 and re-censused these plots in 2008. We then examined the change in species richness, Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s diversity, evenness, and population structure of native species from 1997 to 2008. We also examined the relationship between L. camara density and species richness, diversity, evenness, and population structure. The presence and abundance of L. camara increased dramatically from 1997 to 2008. L. camara occurred in 81% of plots by 2008, compared with only 41% of plots in 1997. Similarly, the mean density of L. camara increased almost fourfold from 1997 to 2008. This was accompanied by a change in native community structure. Species richness, diversity and evenness declined significantly in some forest types, and at the landscape scale. There were also changes in the population structure of native tree species, with reductions in the density of tree saplings, possibly due to competition with L. camara. We demonstrate the pervasive threat posed by L. camara to native vegetation at the scale of individual forest types, and at the larger landscape scale, in our study area. These changes have long-term consequences for forest structure and composition.'

Abstract: 'The spatial changes in forest cover of Similipal biosphere reserve, Odisha, India over eight decades (1930\xe2\x80\x932012) has been quantified by using multi-temporal data from different sources. Over the period, the forest cover reduced by 970.8 km2 (23.6% of the total forest), and most significantly during the period, 1930\xe2\x80\x931975. Human-induced activities like conversion of forest land for agriculture, construction of dams and mining activities have been identified as major drivers of deforestation. Spatial analysis indicates that 399 grids (1 grid = 1 \xc3\x97 1 km) have undergone large-scale changes in forest cover (>75 ha) during 1930\xe2\x80\x931975, while only 3 grids have shown >75 ha loss during 1975\xe2\x80\x931990. Annual net rate of deforestation was 0.58 during 1930\xe2\x80\x931975, which has been reduced substantially during 1975\xe2\x80\x931990 (0.04). Annual gross rate of deforestation in 2006\xe2\x80\x932012 is indeed low (0.01) as compared to the national and global average. This study highlights the impact and effectiveness of conservation practices in minimizing the rate of deforestation and protecting the Similipal Biosphere Reserve.'

Abstract: 'Analyzing the spatial extent and distribution of forest fires is essential for sustainable forest resource management. There is no comprehensive data existing on forest fires on a regular basis in Biosphere Reserves of India. The present work have been carried out to locate and estimate the spatial extent of forest burnt areas using Resourcesat-1 data and fire frequency covering decadal fire events (2004\xe2\x80\x932013) in Similipal Biosphere Reserve. The anomalous quantity of forest burnt area was recorded during 2009 as 1,014.7\xc2\xa0km2. There was inconsistency in the fire susceptibility across the different vegetation types. The spatial analysis of burnt area shows that an area of 34.2\xc2\xa0% of dry deciduous forests, followed by tree savannah, shrub savannah, and grasslands affected by fires in 2013. The analysis based on decadal time scale satellite data reveals that an area of 2,175.9\xc2\xa0km2 (59.6\xc2\xa0% of total vegetation cover) has been affected by varied rate of frequency of forest fires. Fire density pattern indicates low count of burnt area patches in 2013 estimated at 1,017 and high count at 1,916 in 2004. An estimate of fire risk area over a decade identifies 12.2\xc2\xa0km2 is experiencing an annual fire damage. Summing the fire frequency data across the grids (each 1\xc2\xa0km2) indicates 1,211 (26\xc2\xa0%) grids are having very high disturbance regimes due to repeated fires in all the 10 years, followed by 711 grids in 9 years and 418 in 8 years and 382 in 7 years. The spatial database offers excellent opportunities to understand the ecological impact of fires on biodiversity and is helpful in formulating conservation action plans.'

Abstract: 'Leaf phenology describes the seasonal cycle of leaf functioning and is essential for understanding the interactions between the biosphere, the climate and the atmosphere. In this study, we characterized the spatial patterns in phenological variations in eight contrasting forest types in an Indian region using coarse resolution NOAA AVHRR satellite data. The onset, offset and growing season length for different forest types has been estimated using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Further, the relationship between NDVI and climatic parameters has been assessed to determine which climatic variable (temperature or precipitation) best explain variation in NDVI. In addition, we also assessed how quickly and over what time periods does NDVI respond to different precipitation events. Our results suggested strong spatial variability in NDVI metrics for different forest types. Among the eight forest types, tropical dry deciduous forests showed lowest values for summed NDVI (SNDVI), averaged NDVI (ANDVI) and integrated NDVI (I-NDVI), while the tropical wet evergreen forests of Arunachal Pradesh had highest values. Within the different evergreen forest types, SNDVI, ANDVI and INDVI were highest for tropical wet evergreen forests, followed by tropical evergreen forests, tropical semi-evergreen forests and were least for tropical dry evergreen forests. Differences in the amplitude of NDVI were quite distinct for evergreen forests compared to deciduous ones and mixed deciduous forests. Although, all the evergreen forests studied had a similar growing season length of 270 days, the onset and offset dates were quite different. Response of vegetative greenness to climatic variability appeared to vary with vegetation characteristics and forest types. Linear correlations between mean monthly NDVI and temperature were found to yield negative relationships in contrast to precipitation, which showed a significant positive response to vegetation greenness. The correlations improved much for different forest types when the log of cumulative rainfall was correlated against mean monthly NDVI. Of the eight forest types, the NDVI for six forest types was positively correlated with the logarithm of cumulative rainfall that was summed for 3\xe2\x80\x934 months. Overall, this study identifies precipitation as a major control for vegetation greenness in tropical forests, more so than temperature.'

Abstract: 'Agroforestry system has the enormous capacity to achieve social, economic, and environmental goals by optimizing land productivity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the land potentiality in India for agroforestry based on FAO land suitability criteria utilizing various land, soil, climate, and topographic themes. This was achieved in GIS Domain by integrating various thematic layers scientifically. The analysis of land potentiality in India for agroforestry suitability reveals 32.8% as highly suitable (S1), 40.4% moderately suitable (S2), 11.7% marginally suitable (S3), and 9.1% not suitable (NS). About 52% of land of India is under the cropland category. In addition, it revealed that the 46% of these cropland areas fall into high agroforestry suitable category \xe2\x80\x9cS1,\xe2\x80\x9d and provide huge opportunity for harnessing agroforestry practices. Furthermore, agroforestry suitability mapping in broad ecosystem and in different agroecological regions will assist various projects in India at the regional level. Such results will also boost the various objectives of the National Agroforestry Policy (2014, http://www.cafri.res.in/NAF_Policy.pdf) and policymakers of India where they need to extend it. The potential of geospatial technology can be exploited in the field of agroforestry for the benefit of rural poor people/farmers by ensuring food and ecological security, resilience in livelihoods, and can sustain extreme weather events such as droughts and climate change impact. Such type of research can be replicated in India at village level (local level) to state level (regional level) utilizing the significant themes which affect the agroforestry suitability. This will certainly fetch better results on ground and will significantly assist the management programs.'

Abstract: 'Chilika Lake, the largest brackish water lagoon in Asia, is a prominent biodiversity hotspot along the Indian east coast. The geomorphology, water quality and biological productivity of the lake had undergone significant changes over the years under the influence of natural events and anthropogenic interventions. Decades of research have shown that the ecological changes of the lake system and its fisheries were influenced mainly by the water exchange between the lake and the sea that controls the salinity, siltation, macrophyte infestation and recruitment of marine forms. Depletion of fisheries and loss of biodiversity in 1980s and 1990s have been linked to the northward shifting of lake\xe2\x80\x99s inlet and silting up of the outer channel. In order to improve the health of the lagoon and restoration of its biodiversity, a new mouth was dredged open in September 2000. Opening of the new mouth has resulted in some improvements with substantial increase in capture fishery, reduction in weed infestation, growth of seagrasses, appearance of dolphins and increase in the population of migratory birds. But, many stake holders claim that the problems associated with the lake ecology and its contribution to the socio-economic development of the stake holders still persist which could escalate in future.'

Abstract: 'From March 2007 to March 2009 we quantified plant diversity at Chilapatta Reserve Forest in Terai Duars in the Indian eastern Himalayas. We sampled stratified random nested quadrats. Species richness was 311, representing 167 genera and 81 families. The species diversity index and concentration of dominance of the forest were 2.20 and 0.0072, respectively. Shannon-Wiener index and evenness indices were 4.77 and 1.44, respectively. The Importance Value Index (IVI) of species ranged from 0.13 to 37.94. The estimated diversity indices indicated heterogeneity of the forest in its composition, structure, function and dynamics. Rich forest plant diversity supports the need for continued conservation of tropical forests.'

For each tree, DBH was recorded. Mean tree diameter andpatterns of tree size class distribution did not differ among the four forestfragments. However, the fragments differed significantly in both tree andunderstory stem densities, species richness and diversity values, and familyrichness values, with the Lokaro fragment having the lowest values for allmeasures. Furthermore, floristic patterns, family importance values, and communitysimilarity measures revealed that the species composition at theLokaro fragment was very different from the Sainte-Luce fragments. Anthropogenicdisturbance appears most pronounced in the isolated Lokaro forest, where bioticresources are limited to this single fragment.'

Abstract: 'Focal species are valuable tools for evaluating management practices for biodiversity conservation. Butterfly gardening through the creation of appropriate habitats can be a primary conservation tool to increase species abundance and richness and gene flow among the populations in fragmented landscapes. In this context, the role of butterfly gardens in the conservation of butterfly populations and the seasonal population trends of swallowtail butterflies (family Papilionidae) sighted in the Butterfly Safari Park at Thenmala were studied. A total of 4760 sightings of 15 species of swallowtails belonging to five genera were recorded, of which six were endemic species, three species had protected status and two were rare species. It is worth noting that of the 19 species of the papilionids recorded in Kerala, as many as 15 species were recorded in Thenmala. Of the various species recorded, Troides minos, Pachliopta pandiyana, Pachliopta aristolochiae, Graphium agamemnon, Graphium sarpedon, Papilio polytes, Papilio clytia, Papilio demoleus and Papilio polymnestor comprised the resident populations, while species such as Atrophaneura hector, Papilio helenus, Papilio dravidarum, Papilio paris, Papilio liomedon and Graphium nomius were found only during certain seasons. The overall butterfly abundance was high from August to November. The butterfly populations exhibited a gradual decline in numbers from December onwards with the onset of dry seasons. The abundance of butterfly populations was low during March\xe2\x80\x94April. The abundance of T. minos, P. pandiyana, P. polymnestor, P. paris, P. dravidarum, P. helenus, P. polytes and P. liomedon showed a significant negative correlation with monthly average temperature and a significant positive correlation with humidity.'

Abstract: 'Despite increasing recognition of the role spatial pattern can play in ecosystem function, few studies have quantified spatial heterogeneity in savanna ecosystems. The spatial distribution of herbaceous biomass and species composition was measured across three scales in a semi-arid savanna in central Kenya, and patterns were related to environmental variables at different scales. Herbaceous biomass declined across a rainfall gradient and from upper to lower topographic positions, but variation within a site (across 5\xe2\x80\x9350 m) was similar in magnitude to among-site variation associated with rainfall and topography. Geostatistical analyses showed that patchiness at scales of 5\xe2\x80\x9325 m explained 20% of total variation in herbaceous biomass. This pattern arose from the presence of both 5\xe2\x80\x9310-m diameter patches containing high herbaceous biomass (> 170 g m\xe2\x88\x922) and 5\xe2\x80\x9310-m diameter patches characterized by nearly bare soil surfaces (< 40 g m\xe2\x88\x922). Patch structure was contingent on topography, with larger bare patches at ridgeline and upper hillslope positions. Grass species distributions showed the greatest degree of patch structure and species turnover across distances of 5\xe2\x80\x9345 m. Additional community variation was associated with topography, with minimal variation in species composition across the rainfall gradient. Pattern diversity significantly exceeded levels reported for four other grassland ecosystems, suggesting fundamental differences in local processes generating spatial pattern. It is hypothesized that heterogeneously distributed grazing pressure, interacting with the distribution of shrub canopies, is an important factor generating such high levels of small-scale patch structure in this savanna.'

Abstract: 'In the present study, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method namely inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) was employed to assess genetic stability in tissue culture-derived Dictyospermum ovalifolium plantlets. To study genomic stability of micropropagated plants, 14 individuals were randomly tagged among a population of 2500 regenerants and were compared with single donor mother plant. A total of 51 clear and reproducible bands ranging from 200 bp to 2.1 kb were scored corresponding to an average of 3.64 bands per primer. Two of the 51 bands were polymorphic (3.92 %) among 14 individuals, thus indicating the occurrence of low level genomic variation in the micropropagated plants. Cluster analysis indicates that genetic similarity values were 0.978 which allows classification of the plants to distinct groups. Further an attempt was made to reintroduce the micropropagated plants into their natural habitat. Over one thousand six hundred fifty plants were successfully established.'

Abstract: ' Hypericum hookerianum (Hypericaceae), a critically endangered plant of Western Ghats, India, has acquired significant importance due to its medicinal implications and ornamental flowers. This species is under severe anthropogenic pressure due to urbanization, tourism, and plantation activities taking place in their natural habitat. A clonal propagation strategy is standardized in this species which offers an opportunity for a stable production of active metabolites from this species as well as their conservation. The study deals with the optimization of axillary bud proliferation using nodal explants followed by genetic stability analysis of regenerants. Maximum number of shoots (3.66) was observed on the Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with Kinetin (2.325\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M) with 85\xc2\xa0% shoot multiplication frequency. In vitro grown shoots were rooted best in 1/2 MS medium supplemented with indole-3-butyric acid (2.45\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M) with an average of 6.8\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.79\xc2\xa0roots/shoot and 95.5\xc2\xa0% rooting frequency. Plantlets were acclimatized best (90\xc2\xa0%) in a mixture of sterile sand and farmyard manure (3:1). Micropropagated plants were subjected to random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis and phytochemical analysis to confirm their clonal stability. In RAPD analysis, 1032 amplicons were collectively generated which were monomorphic and similar to the mother plant. The comparable major phytochemical constituents in regenerants and mother plants together with genetic uniformity data obtained from RAPD analysis confirmed clonal fidelity of the regenerants. Findings in this study are the first report on micropropagation and assessment of genetic stability of micropropagated plantlets in H. hookerianum which suggests that in vitro axillary shoot proliferation can effectively be used as a tool for propagation and conservation of H. hookerianum.'

Abstract: 'There is huge knowledge gap in our understanding of many terrestrial carbon cycle processes. In this paper, we investigate the bounds on terrestrial carbon uptake over India that arises solely due to CO  2  -fertilization. For this purpose, we use a terrestrial carbon cycle model and consider two extreme scenarios: unlimited CO2-fertilization is allowed for the terrestrial vegetation with CO2 concentration level at 735\xc2\xa0ppm in one case, and CO2-fertilization is capped at year 1975 levels for another simulation. Our simulations show that, under equilibrium conditions, modeled carbon stocks in natural potential vegetation increase by 17 Gt-C with unlimited fertilization for CO2 levels and climate change corresponding to the end of 21st century but they decline by 5.5 Gt-C if fertilization is limited at 1975 levels of CO2 concentration. The carbon stock changes are dominated by forests. The area covered by natural potential forests increases by about 36% in the unlimited fertilization case but decreases by 15% in the fertilization-capped case. Thus, the assumption regarding CO2-fertilization has the potential to alter the sign of terrestrial carbon uptake over India. Our model simulations also imply that the maximum potential terrestrial sequestration over India, under equilibrium conditions and best case scenario of unlimited CO2-fertilization, is only 18% of the 21st century SRES A2 scenarios emissions from India. The limited uptake potential of the natural potential vegetation suggests that reduction of CO2 emissions and afforestation programs should be top priorities.'

Abstract: 'A potentially diagnostic 18S rDNA (ribosomal DNA) gene was amplified reliably from red-listed ethnomedicinal species of Myristica and its wild and related genera. Individuals from nine species of Myristicaceae were utilized for the study. The sequences ranged from 1,767 to 1,794 nucleotide (nt) in length. The GC content (%) varied from 52.77 to 51.04. The frequencies (%) of nt were A (23.31), T (23.82), C (24.48) and G (28.39). The alignment of all sequences produced 195/1,516 variable sites and 1,257/1,516 conserved sites. Total numbers of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites found in the alignment were 146/1,516. Knema andamanica (Warb.) W.J. de Wilde was the most distinct that included 18 variable regions and 15 InDel with 27 SNP sites, specific to this species. The identified regions from nine species of Myristica and its wild and closely related genera were deposited in the GenBank Database (Accession numbers JN228257-JN228265). Comparison of morphological identifications and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the specimens were correctly assigned on the basis of a short stretch of 18S rDNA (~1,600\xc2\xa0bp) making this a potentially useful marker for the rapid molecular assignment of an unknown related species also. Significant sequence homology ranging from 72 to 99\xc2\xa0% was observed on comparison with 18S rDNA genes of other plants in the public domain. A comparison of intraspecific data information of nine 18S with that of 73 matK and 86 rbcL sequences from GenBank revealed that polymorphism, divergence and conservation is higher in 18S locus for Myristicaceae. Hence these markers may be utilized for phylogenetic analysis, evaluation of species richness during ecological surveys or for environmental assessments. These molecular markers are especially important due to the fact that the species studied are mostly vulnerable and red-listed with limited availability in endangered ecological niches.'

Abstract: 'There are many vanishing cultures that possess a wealth of knowledge on the medicinal utility of plants. The Malasars of Dravidian Tamils are an indigenous society occupying the forests of the Western Ghats, South India. They are known to be exceptional healers and keepers of traditional aboriginal knowledge (TAK) of the flora in the Velliangiri holy hills. In fact, their expertise is well known throughout India as evidenced by the thousands of pilgrims that go to the Velliangiri holy hills for healing every year. Our research is the first detailed study of medicinal plants in India that considers variation in TAK among informants using a quantitative consensus analysis. A total of 95 species belonging to 50 families were identified for medicinal and general health purposes. For each species the botanical name, family, local name, parts used, summary of mode of preparation, administration and curing are provided. The consensus analysis revealed a high level of agreement among the informants usage of a particular plant at a local scale. The average consensus index value of an informant was FIC > 0.71, and over 0.80 for some ailments such as respiratory and jaundice. Some of the more common problems faced by the Malasars were gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory illness, dermatological problems and simple illness such as fever, cough, cold, wounds and bites from poisonous animals. We also discovered several new ethnotaxa that have considerable medicinal utility. This study supports claims that the Malasars possess a rich TAK of medicinal plants and that many aboriginals and mainstream people (pilgrims) utilize medicinal plants of the Velliangiri holy hills. Unfortunately, the younger generation of Malasars are not embracing TAK as they tend to migrate towards lucrative jobs in more developed urban areas. Our research sheds some light on a traditional culture that believes that a healthy lifestyle is founded on a healthy environment and we suggest that TAK such as that of the Malasars may serve toward a global lifestyle of health and environmental sustainability.'

Abstract: 'Although Small Hydropower Projects (SHPs) are encouraged as sources of clean and green energy, there is a paucity of research examining their socio-ecological impacts. We assessed the perceived socio-ecological impacts of 4 SHPs within the Western Ghats in India by conducting semi-structured interviews with local respondents. Primary interview data were sequentially validated with secondary data, and respondent perceptions were subsequently compared against the expected baseline of assured impacts. We evaluated the level of awareness about SHPs, their perceived socio-economic impacts, influence on resource access and impacts on human\xe2\x80\x93elephant interactions. The general level of awareness about SHPs was low, and assurances of local electricity and employment generation remained largely unfulfilled. Additionally most respondents faced numerous unanticipated adverse impacts. We found a strong relationship between SHP construction and increasing levels of human\xe2\x80\x93elephant conflict. Based on the disparity between assured and actual social impacts, we suggest that policies regarding SHPs be suitably revised.'

Abstract: '\nParasporins, a class of non-insecticidal crystal proteins of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are being explored as promising anticancer agents due to their specific toxicity to cancer cells. The present study has identified 25 Bt isolates harbouring parasporin genes from Western Ghats region, the hotspot of biodiversity in India. Among these, the isolate, KAU 41 (Kerala Agricultural University isolate 41) contained non-hemolytic homogenous crystals showing specific cytotoxicity towards cancer cells. SDS-PAGE analysis of this crystal, isolated by aqueous biphasic separation, revealed a 31\xc2\xa0kDa sized peptide. The N-terminal sequence deciphered in BLAST analysis showed homology to a hypothetical Bt protein. Upon proteolysis, a 29\xc2\xa0kDa active peptide was generated which exhibited heterogenic cytotoxic spectrum on various cancer cells. HeLa cells were highly susceptible to this peptide with IC50 1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g/mL and showed characteristics of apoptosis. RT-qPCR analysis revealed the overexpression of APAF1, caspase 3 and 9 by 14.9, 8 and 7.4\xc2\xa0fold, respectively which indicates the activation of intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. However, at higher concentrations of peptide (>3\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g/mL), necrotic death was prominent. The results suggest that the 31\xc2\xa0kDa protein from Bt isolate, KAU 41 is a parasporin that may have high therapeutic potential.'

Abstract: '\nWe summarize the research on Asian Sun catfish, Horabagrus brachysoma (G\xc3\xbcnther), an endemic and threatened freshwater catfish from Western Ghats of India, and provide a comprehensive review of its taxonomy, distribution, biology, population, conservation and aquaculture. Although described in 1864, the taxonomy of H. brachysoma, particularly its familial affinities, continues to be in flux. The species, originally described from the erstwhile \xe2\x80\x98state of Cochin\xe2\x80\x99 in present day Kerala State, India, has a current distribution ranging from southern Kerala (8\xc2\xb0N) to southern Maharashtra (16\xc2\xb0N), where they are found in lowland westward-flowing rivers, as well as natural freshwater lakes and backwaters. As a much relished food fish, H. brachysoma is exploited throughout its range, predominantly through an unmanaged artisanal fishery. Although there are no scientific estimates of either the status or trends in overall population of this endemic catfish, anecdotal evidence and fisher-knowledge suggests drastic declines of several local populations. The fishery for H. brachysoma in the Periyar and Achenkovil rivers in the State of Kerala has been documented to be unsustainable. As a result of an overall population decline of 35\xc2\xa0% due to overharvest and habitat loss, H. brachysoma is assessed as \xe2\x80\x98Vulnerable\xe2\x80\x99 on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\xe2\x84\xa2. Primary research on various aspects of feeding, reproductive biology and demography has generated a wealth of information on the species, but this knowledge is yet to be utilized for the development and implementation of in situ conservation or management plans. In view of its high consumer demand, efficient biological and eco-physiological characteristics, as well as the availability of a captive breeding technology, H. brachysoma is considered an emerging species for small-scale aquaculture. Priorities for scientific research to address knowledge-gaps, as well as strategies for effective conservation of this threatened freshwater catfish are discussed.'

Abstract: 'Arunachal Pradesh, the easternmost part of India, is endowed with diverse natural resources and inhabited by a variety of ethnic groups that have developed skills to exploit the biotic resources of the region for food and medicines. Information on animals and animal parts as components of folk remedies used by local healers and village headmen of the Nyishi and Galo tribes in their respective West Siang and Subansiri districts were obtained through interviews and structured questionnaires. Of a total of 36 vertebrate species used in treatments of ailments and diseases, mammals comprised 50%; they were followed by birds (22%), fishes (17%), reptiles (8%) and amphibians (3%). Approximately 20 common complaints of humans as well as foot and mouth disease of cattle were targets of zootherapies. Most commonly treated were fevers, body aches and pains, tuberculosis, malaria, wounds and burns, typhoid, smallpox, dysentery and diarrhoea, jaundice, and early pregnancy pains. Very few domestic animal species (e.g., goat and cattle) were used zootherapeutically. More frequently it was wild animals, including endangered or protective species like hornbill, pangolin, clouded leopard, tiger, bear, and wolf, whose various parts were either used in folk remedies or as food. Some of the animal-based traditional medicines or animal parts were sold at local markets, where they had to compete with modern, western pharmaceuticals. To record, document, analyze and test the animal-derived local medicines before they become replaced by western products is one challenge; to protect the already dwindling populations of certain wild animal species used as a resource for the traditional animal-derived remedies, is another.'

Title: 'Intersexual mimicry and flowering phenology facilitate pollination in a dioecious habitat specialist species, Myristica fatua (Myristicaceae)'

Abstract: 'Myristica fatua is a dioecious specialist species restricted to the endangered, freshwater Myristica swamp forests in the Western Ghats, India. Earlier studies have alluded to pollination by deception in members of the Myristica genus, and thus we examined the pollination ecology comprising floral biology, flower production, flower visitors, and reproductive success in M. fatua and inferred the potential strategies that could permit such deception in this habitat specialist tree. Male flowers provide pollen rewards for an extended period of time while female flowers are rewardless and both sexes are visited by generalist insects, mainly by honeybees and stingless bees. Bee visits were significantly more frequent and longer on male than on female flowers as bees collected pollen from male flowers. We found that flower production patterns create a preponderance of males compared to females in the swamp populations. Using a model of honeybee color vision, we found the distance between the color loci of male and female flowers and based on minimum visual angle subtended by these flowers, we suggest that the two floral sexes cannot be discriminated by bees. Bees are likely deceived by the perceptual similarity of rewardless female flowers to pollen-offering male flowers and pollination is the consequence of foraging errors made by pollinators that encounter largely male\xe2\x80\x93rarely female flower mosaics as they forage among clump-distributed M. fatua trees in the swamp habitat.'

Abstract: 'Tourism industry has become an important part of Indian economy, and tourism development has been, however, concentrated to a few areas. Accumulation of tourism activities has reached the critical stage in most of the tourism centers, which pose serious threats to the natural environment. The Bhyundar Valley of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) in Uttarakhand State of the Indian Himalaya is a burning example of such problems. Land use/cover changes, deforestation and accumulation of garbage are some of the negative impacts of unregulated tourism in the valley. Unsustainable activities of tourists and villagers in the valley make such problems very severe. To deal with the ongoing problems and ensure community involvement in tourism management and environmental conservation, the Biosphere Reserve Authority introduced ecotourism in the form of Eco Development Committees (EDCs) in the Bhyundar Valley. Study reveals that many problems associated with tourism have been minimized to some extent with the help of EDCs but few are still prevailing in valley. However, the existing attempts to conserve the valley from the negative effects of tourism are inadequate and modifications are needed in the current initiatives.'

Abstract: ' Shorea robusta Gaertn. f. (Sal) is one of the important timber-yielding plants in India, which dominates the vegetation of Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh state in India forming various communities based on its associations. The present study deals with delineation, mapping and characterization of various communities of Sal (Shorea robusta) forests in Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh, India ranging across over 16 districts. Field survey and visual interpretation based forest vegetation type classification and mapping was carried out as part of the project entitled \xe2\x80\x98Biodiversity characterization at landscape level using remote sensing and GIS\xe2\x80\x99. Indian Remote Sensing-P6 (Resourcesat-1) Linear Imaging Self Scanner-III satellite data was used during the study. The total area covered by different Sal forests was found to be approximately 2256.77 km2. Sal communities were identified and characterized based on their spectral properties, physiognomy and phytosociological characteristics. Following nine Sal communities were identified, delineated and mapped with reasonable accuracy viz., Chandar, Damar, dry plains, moist plains, western alluvium, western alluvium plains, mixed moist deciduous, mixed dry deciduous and Siwalik. It is evident from the area estimates that mixed moist deciduous Sal is the most dominant community in the region covering around (1613.90 km2), other major communities were found as western alluvium plains Sal (362.44 km2), mixed dry deciduous Sal (362.44 km2) and dry plains Sal (107.71 km2). The Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh faces tremendous anthropogenic pressure leading to deterioration of the forests. Community level information could be used monitoring the status as well as for micro level conservation and planning of the Sal forests in Terai Landscape of Uttar Pradesh.'

Abstract: 'Rhizobacterial production of plant hormones, ACC deaminase, fixation of nitrogen, solubilization of phosphate and antimicrobial metabolites play very important role in the health and growth of plants. Hence exploration of plant probiotic prospectives of promising rhizobacterial isolates from biodiversity rich areas can have enormous applications to engineer both the biomass and active ingredients of plants. In the present study, rhizospheric Proteus spp. R6 and R60 isolated from Pseudarthria viscida and Glycosmis arborea were analyzed for tuber and diosgenin enhancement effects in Dioscorea nipponica under field conditions for 1 year. Among the two Proteus spp. selected, both were positive for ACC deaminase, siderophore, nitrogen fixation, IAA and ammonia production. However, the isolate R6 was found to have additional phosphate solubilizing activity. Quantitative analysis of IAA by HPTLC showed its maximum production by Proteus sp. R60 (714.47\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa08.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g/mL) followed by Proteus sp. R6 (588.06\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa07.0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g/mL). The tubers formed from the Proteus sp. R6 treated samples were identified to have significant enhancement in size, root number and diosgenin content when compared to control. Interestingly, HPLC analysis has confirmed twofold higher diosgenin content in Proteus sp. R6 treated samples than control during 1 year period of its field growth. The obtained results are of great importance as it involved the utilization of rhizospheric bacteria to improve tuber size which suggests its potential use in developing cost-effective, eco-friendly and multifunctional biofertilizer.'

Abstract: 'In the Indian subcontinent there is hardly any study that compares the bird community structure of urban/suburban areas with those of forest habitat. The present survey identified diverse assemblages of birds in the Pauri district at different elevations. A total of 125 bird species belonging to 40 families including two least count species (Lophura leucomelanos and Pucrasia marcolopha) were recorded during this survey in the forest and urbanized habitats of Pauri District (Garhwal Hiamalaya) of Uttarakhand state, India. The high elevation (Pauri 1600\xe2\x80\x932100 m a.s.l.), mid elevation (Srikot-Khanda 900\xe2\x80\x931300 m a.s.l.) and low elevation (Srinagar 500\xe2\x80\x93900 m a.s.l.) contributed 88.8%, 63.2% and 58.4% of the total species respectively. Rarefaction analysis and Shannon diversity index showed that the high elevation forest habitat had highest bird species richness (BSR) and bird species diversity (BSD) followed by the mid and then the low elevation forests. BSR and BSD fluctuated across seasons at all elevations but not across habitat types. Present study provides a base line data about avian community composition in urbanized and natural habitats along altitudinal gradient in the study area. This information may be useful to the conservation biologists for the better management and conservation of the avifauna in the Western Himalaya, a part of one of the hot biodiversity spots of the world.'

Title: 'Making Pushkar Paradise: Hindu Ritualization and the Environment'

Abstract: 'Based on ethnographic fieldwork in the pilgrimage and tourist town of Pushkar, India, this article looks at the environmental degradation that has befallen the holy lake there and explores efforts on the part of locals to clean it. While local Hindus believe unequivocally that their town is a heavenly place, many nevertheless recognize the need to actualize that belief. The article contends that the broad goal of making Pushkar paradise, and more specifically, the task of cleaning the lake, involves a robust process of ritualization. Thinking alongside the work of Catherine Bell, the article aims to show how environmentalism becomes ritualized, and in turn renders a place sacred. The article concludes with the idea that cleaning the lake is both an activity born out of the understanding that Pushkar is paradise and one that simultaneously sets paradise in the making.'

Abstract: 'The dispersal ability of a species is central to its biology, affecting other processes like local adaptation, population and community dynamics, and genetic structure. Among the intrinsic, species-specific factors that affect dispersal ability in butterflies, wingspan was recently shown to explain a high amount of variance in dispersal ability. In this study, a comparative approach was adopted to test whether a difference in wingspan translates into a difference in population genetic structure. Two closely related butterfly species from subfamily Satyrinae, family Nymphalidae, which are similar with respect to all traits that affect dispersal ability except for wingspan, were studied. Melanitis leda (wingspan 60\xe2\x80\x9380\xc2\xa0mm) and Ypthima baldus (wingspan 30\xe2\x80\x9340\xc2\xa0mm) were collected from the same areas along the Western Ghats of southern India. Amplified fragment length polymorphisms were used to test whether the species with a higher wingspan (M. leda) exhibited a more homogenous population genetic structure, as compared to a species with a shorter wingspan (Y. baldus). In all analyses, Y. baldus exhibited greater degree of population genetic structuring. This study is one of the few adopting a comparative approach to establish the relationship between traits that affect dispersal ability and population genetic structure.'

Abstract: 'A large number of economically disadvantaged people live around protected areas. Conservation efforts that focus on poverty alleviation, work on the premise that an increase in household wealth decreases use of forest resources. We surveyed 1222 households across four tiger reserves to test the paradigm that an increase in assets leads to reduced forest use and we also assess the effects of other socio-economic factors. We find that increase in assets may reduce Non-timber Forest Product (NTFP) collection, but may not necessarily reduce livestock numbers or use of wood as a cooking fuel. Households that faced more economic setbacks were more likely to state that they wanted more livestock in the future. Education is positively associated with choosing Liquefied Petroleum Gas as a cooking fuel in the future. We find site and resource-specific variation. Fifty percent of all households (range across sites: 6\xe2\x80\x9398) want to collect NTFP while 91% (range: 87\xe2\x80\x9396) want to retain or own more livestock over the next 5\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0years. Understanding current and future resource use will help plan context-specific conservation efforts that are better aligned with reducing specific pressures around protected areas.'

Title: 'Agroforestry coffee production increased by native shade trees, irrigation, and liming'

Abstract: 'Agroforestry systems usually include a high density and diversity of shade trees. Such systems often have a large diversity of fauna and flora and provide local and regional ecosystem services. Shade trees are, however, being removed to increase crop production in many tropical regions. There is little knowledge on the effect of shade trees on crop production in the context of trade-offs with other management practices. We therefore compared the benefits of exotic versus native shade trees on coffee production. We evaluated the importance of shade tree management for crop production in the context of management practices. Management practices included fertilization, liming, coffee pruning, weeding, and irrigation in 113 coffee agroforests in Kodagu, India, over a wide range of shade tree density, tree species diversity, and shade cover. We studied, in particular, Grevillea and non-Grevillea shade trees, the latter including mostly native tree species. Results show that a rise of 100 non-Grevillea shade tree per hectare increased production of berries by 5.6\xc2\xa0% and larger beans by 6.25\xc2\xa0%. Irrigation and liming increased berry production respectively by 16 and 20\xc2\xa0%. These management interventions are likely to offset the relatively small negative effect of reducing shade density of non-Grevillea trees on coffee production. Recommendations based on an understanding of shade tree management alone can be misleading with regard to crop production.'

Abstract: 'The present research was undertaken to explor the possibility of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) association with Asteraceae plants in the arid lands of Saudi Arabia (Al-Ghat, Buraydah, Thumamah and Huraymila). AM fungal colonization in the roots, spore numbers in the rhizosphere soil, fungal species diversity and correlation between AM properties and soil properties were determined. The highest colonization was in Conyza bonariensis (65%) from Al-Ghat, Anthemis cotula (52%) from Buraydah and C. bonariensis (53%) from Thumamah. The lowest was in Vernonia schimperi (41%) from Al-Ghat, Pulicaria undulata (25%) from Buraydah, Acanthospermum hispidum (34%) from Thumamah, Asteriscus graveolens (22%) and V. schimperi (22%) from Huraymila. Vesicular and arbuscular colonization were also presented in all plant species examined. The number of spores were 112\xe2\x80\x93207 in Al-Ghat, 113\xe2\x80\x93133 in Buraydah, 87\xe2\x80\x93148 in Thumamah and 107\xe2\x80\x93158 in Huraymila. Funneliformis mosseae, Glomus etunicatum, G. fasciculatum and G. aggregatum were identified. Relative frequency of AM fungal species varied widely and was irrespective of location and plant species. Diversity index varied with the rhizosphere soils of different plant species at various locations. Soil properties varied with locations and no distinct correlations were observed among the soil properties, root colonization and the number of spores. The results of the present study specified the association of AM fungi in different plants of Asteraceae and its significance in the ecological functioning of annual plants in the punitive environments of the rangelands in Saudi Arabia.'

Abstract: 'Mosses are one of the dominant plant communities at higher elevations in the Himalaya and play an important role in the ecosystem dynamics. The authors assessed the diversity of mosses in the Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (KWLS) of Garhwal Himalaya, India. A total of 113 species of mosses belonging to 65 genera are recorded along with their habitat preference, life strategies, growth forms and pattern of distribution at an altitudinal gradient in KWLS. Seven species of mosses viz., Dicranum orthophylloides Dix., Prionidium setschwanicum (Broth.) Hilp., Funaria microstoma Bruch ex Schimp., Plagiomnium drummondii (Bruch & Schimp.) T. Kop., Aerobryopsis wallichii (Brid.) Fleisch., Barbella turgida Nog. and Thuidium talongense Besch. are recorded for the first time from India. Twelve species of mosses are found new to western Himalaya, which were earlier reported to be endemic to eastern Himalayan region. Fifty two species are new records for Garhwal Himalayan region. Bryaceae (22 spp.) and Bryum (9 spp.) are found to be widely distributed taxa followed by Meteoriaceae (8 genera), Pottiaceae (8 genera) and Dicranaceae (6 genera).'

Abstract: 'Studying biodiversity change in existing typical ecosystems of the world under possible global climate change and local human activities is important for diversity conservation. An adapted forest dynamics model is used to simulate tree diversity change of the remaining primary mixed-broadleaved Korean pine forest (RPMKPF) in northeast China under global climate change and local human activities for the next 50 years. Human activities include logging, which removes all big trees (DBH > 50 cm), removing all individuals of each single species and all species of each functional type (shade tolerant, shade intolerant and medium type tree species). As results for RPMKPF, the \xce\xb1 index of tree diversity decreases under climate change, but it increases significantly under a combination of climate change and logging. Removing all individuals of each single species significantly affects the tree diversity of the ecosystem. After the removal of shade tolerant species, both \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2c indices of tree diversity experience a significant change. The \xce\xb1 index decreases significantly under climate change when shade intolerant or medium type tree species are removed, but the \xce\xb2c index does not change significantly. The results of this study have implications for tree diversity management in RPMKPF under climate change and human activities.'

Abstract: 'The Nilwala Ganga Basin of Sri Lanka includes important natural wetlands that are habitat for vulnerable animal and plant species. Flood protection and intensive rice production in the Basin have resulted in degraded acid soils and declining rice yields. However, traditional \xe2\x80\x98maavee\xe2\x80\x99 rice production outside the flood protection scheme has continued to generate a high-value rice product. This study reports on interviews conducted with farmers and other stakeholders to document the production practices and the potential environmental and economic benefits associated with maavee rice paddies. The maavee production system has prevailed for at least several decades. Farmers apply no chemicals to their paddies, relying instead on alluvial deposits as a source of nutrients, and on the natural pest and disease resistance of their traditional varieties. The maavee rice product can attain three times the selling price of rice from conventional farms making it more economically viable than conventional rice production. However, much of maavee production is for home consumption and the system is threatened by increasing labour costs, an ageing farming population and pressures to increase rice yields. Non-invasive production practices and the proximity of maavee paddies to regenerating wetlands in the Kirala Kele Sanctuary suggest that traditional paddies may constitute an important habitat for vulnerable wildlife; however, maavee farmers also perceive wetland birds as potentially damaging to rice. Based on a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis, we make recommendations for future research needs and potential management actions to safeguard the environmental and economic sustainability of the maavee system.'

Abstract: ' Vateria indica (Dipterocarpaceae) is an economically and ecologically important canopy tree endemic to the Western Ghats, India. The species has undergone extensive habitat loss and overexploitation and is therefore listed as \xe2\x80\x98critically endangered\xe2\x80\x99 on the 2012 IUCN Red List. We developed ten polymorphic microsatellite loci for V. indica. In addition, we confirm cross amplification and variation in two loci isolated from the closely related but geographically disjunct species Vateriopsis seychellarum, previously published by Finger et al. Conserv Genet Resour, 2 (S1):309\xe2\x80\x93311, (2010). The twelve microsatellite primers screened on 48 adult samples of V. indica had 5\xe2\x80\x9311 alleles per locus (mean of 8.5 per locus) with an average polymorphic information content of 0.64 across loci. Expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.44 to 0.84. These markers will enable us to quantify population genetic diversity in habitat fragments and to study fine scale spatial genetic structure and contemporary gene flow.'

Title: 'Signatures of Holocene Hydrological Processes from Sedimentary Archives in Southwestern India: Case Studies from Wetlands of Kerala Coast'

Abstract: 'The subsurface sediments of the Kerala coast provided signatures of hydrological processes that have influenced in the modifications and conversion of larger part of the lowland and the forest cover into a major wetland system during the Holocene which in turn has transformed into one of the best carbon sinks in the Indian subcontinent. The most significant and well recognized signature is the paleoflood event during the Early to Middle Holocene coinciding with the Holocene Climate Optimum (HCO). The excessive rainfall seems to have flooded the entire forest area in the coastal plains and the forests that flourished in the abandoned river channels and other low-lying areas in the midland. Formation of peat and peat land development in the inland region, but not far away from the coast, towards the Middle Holocene has been another important imprint of the hydrological process. Occurrence of peat sequence of 1\xe2\x80\x933 m at shallower depths stands testimony to such episodes. The other recognized imprints include the erosion and reworking of older sediments that contain the Neogene pollen elements and development of bay head deltas and other alluvial deposits in the mouth of the rivers. The mangrove dynamics too provided sufficient evidence of their prevalence, stability and decreasing tendency depending up on the hydrological regimes during the Holocene. Though episodes related to mud bank formation, as of now, are restricted to recent times, sediment archives, dated as Late Holocene, revealed scope for decoding the signatures of hydrological and geological processes associated with the monsoon vicissitudes.'

Title: 'Forest plantations, water availability, and regional climate change: controversies surrounding Acacia mearnsii plantations in the upper Palnis Hills, southern India'

Abstract: 'Plantation forests not only impact carbon and water cycles, but also affect biodiversity, livelihoods, and shape regional economies. Each of these impacts differs across varying scales of analysis. This paper illustrates how forest, climate change and hydrology debates play out in the context of the forest plantations of Australian black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) in the upper Palni hills of southern India. We outline the contradictory perspectives of different local groups regarding the impact of plantations on catchment hydrology and water availability, and examine these in relation to changes in the regional economy and rainfall patterns. Our analysis indicates that changes in these two factors have played a more significant role than existing wattle plantations in affecting local and regional water availability. We suggest that ongoing debates regarding forest plantation\xe2\x80\x93hydrology\xe2\x80\x93climate change relationships need to broaden their scope to include changes in regional rainfall patterns and shifts in regional economic activity. This approach is likely to provide a more realistic assessment of plantation forests in a dynamic regional context, and offer more resilient strategies for regional landscape and catchment management under conditions of high variability in rainfall patterns.'

Abstract: 'The present study aimed at the characterization of rice landraces collected from the state of Goa for their utilization in breeding programs. Eighteen landraces of rice were collected from the remote villages of Goa during the survey conducted between 2010 and 2013 along with passport data and traditional knowledge. All the 18 landraces were characterized for 27 qualitative and 16 quantitative characters as per the DUS guidelines. They were also screened for salt tolerance at seedling stage under microplot conditions. Qualitative characters were analyzed using Shannon diversity and Cluster analysis, whereas quantitative characters were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). Shannon diversity index ranged from 0.00 to 1.00 with a mean of 0.60. Cluster analysis grouped the accessions into two major clusters with three subclusters in each of the main cluster with a Jaccard similarity coefficient varying between 0.38 and 0.87. PCA has revealed four major components (eigenvalue\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x891), which altogether explained 80.60% of the total variation. Phenotyping for salt stress at seedling stage grouped the landraces as highly tolerant (Korgut-red), moderately tolerant (Shidde, Korgut-black) and sensitive to highly sensitive. Information generated from this study would be useful in selecting landrace collections as donors in breeding new varieties.'

Abstract: 'Wildlife conservation is a complex issue especially when it involves large carnivores or mega-herbivores that are conflict-prone. Karnataka state in southern India is known to harbor high density of wild elephants. This conservation success story also has opportunity costs for communities living in close proximity to elephants. Despite the fact that human\xe2\x80\x93elephant conflict is a serious conservation and social issue, there is little quantitative understanding of conflict especially over large areas. Here we conduct the first analysis of human\xe2\x80\x93elephant conflict distribution, severity and explanatory factors over the entire state of Karnataka. We use data from the state forest department records on villages that experience conflict, compensation payments made by the government, elephant densities, forest cover and perimeter, and presence of physical barriers to mitigate elephant conflict. In total, 60,939 incidences of crop loss were reported and US$ 2.99\xc2\xa0m paid in compensation during April 2008\xe2\x80\x93March 2011. A total of 91 people were killed by elephants and 101 elephants died in retaliatory killings during the study period. A total of 9.4\xc2\xa0% of the state\xe2\x80\x99s geographic area covering 25 of the 42 forest administrative divisions were affected. There was no significant difference in conflict incidences or compensation given between protected areas and non-protected areas. There was no correlation between conflict incidences/unit area and elephant density, forest cover, forest perimeter of protected areas and presence of physical barriers. The results depict the importance of efficient management of physical barriers, conserving key habitat linkages, and acts as baseline data for future work.'

Abstract: "Tropical dry forest is the most endangered major vegetation type in the New Caledonia biodiversity hotspot. Vegetation surveys following a transect method used by Gentry were undertaken in two tropical dry forest sites, Ouen-Toro and Pindai, in order to compare species richness, floristic composition, and structure. Pindai contained significantly higher species richness than Ouen-Toro, although there was little difference in forest structure. Tropical dry forest sites in New Caledonia were compared to seven other biodiversity hotspots with tropical dry forest where Gentry's transect method was employed. New Caledonia and other tropical dry forests on islands contain significantly lower species richness than mainland tropical dry forests in biodiversity hotspots. However, New Caledonia contained the highest number of threatened species based on IUCN global conservation categories. Tropical dry forest in New Caledonia appears to be the world's most endangered tropical dry forest based on the extent of forest, number of reserves, and threatened species. Management of tropical dry forests on private and community lands is absolutely imperative to the long-term persistence of this ecosystem."

Abstract: 'Detailed information on the ground-dwelling ant diversity and distribution in the rainforests of the Congo Basin is lacking so far. A new ant species list from a continuous mixed secondary lowland rainforest on the northern periphery of the Dja Biosphere Reserve in southeast Cameroon is presented. We investigated the effect of vegetation type on ant species density, activity and composition. Ants were collected by pitfall trapping in seven vegetation types in each of three seasons during 12 months in 2003 and 2004\xe2\x80\x932005. Our site in Cameroon had a total observed ant diversity of 145 species. Vegetation type significantly influenced the ground-dwelling and -foraging (arboreal) ant assemblages. Differences in species density, activity and composition between vegetation types were explained not only by soil type (hydromorphous \xe2\x80\x93 terra firme), but also by developmental stage of vegetation types. The highly inundated Raphia-swamp had the lowest ant species density and activity. Older secondary forests still had a different species composition than near primary forest even after 25 years of recovery after anthropogenic disturbance. Finally, the high ant species number captured by our pitfalls, the absence of the invasive exotic ant Wasmannia auropunctata and the high Dorylus (Anomma) army ant diversity confirm the importance of the Cameroonian rainforest for biodiversity conservation programs.'

Abstract: 'India is a vast country and is highly diversified in terms of natural resources and socio-economic setup. Moreover, its water resources are unevenly distributed in space and time. With increasing population and increasing aspiration for improved standard of living, there is an acute pressure on the demand and availability of water. Though the idea of interlinking of rivers is not a new concept in India, it had rather persisted long back as much as in other countries of ancient civilization. National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has given the real shape to the proposal of the interlinking of rivers of the country. In India the river-linking project in a sensible and scientific manner will not only allow the prevention of the colossal wastage of a vitally important natural resource, mitigate the flood and inundation by detaining flowing surface water of rainy seasons, but also ensure availability of water to drier areas; combating both flood and drought simultaneously. Moreover, this project will generate 34,000\xc2\xa0MW of hydropower and irrigation of an additional 35\xc2\xa0million hectares (135,135\xc2\xa0square miles) of land. Though linking of rivers may initially appear to be a costly proposition in ecological, geological, hydrological and economical terms, in the long run the net benefits coming from it will far outweigh these costs or losses. However, in the absence of any definite international legal framework, Bangladesh has raised objections against the project. This paper aims at looking at this long-term plan, the project proposal, its involvement and impact not only on the states of India, India as a whole, but also on its neighbouring nations which are linked with India through the waterways, and share the common climatic conditions and economic status.'

Abstract: 'The stream network comprising Mahanadi and its tributaries, viz. Katjhori, Devi, Koyakhai, Kushbhadra and Bhargavi, cut transversely the ESE-WNW trending basement structure in the Cuttack-Paradip-Puri section and diverge radially from one another near and around Cuttack. The Mahanadi river flows in an ESE-WNW direction, the Katjhori and Devi rivers flow in a NW-SE direction and Koyakhai, Kushbhadra and Bhargavi River in an almost N-S direction. The general southeasterly direction of these rivers and the delta formation was thought to be continued throughout the Quaternary period and the delta was a case of superposition upon the deformational structures derived from the erosional surfaces covered by recent sediments.'

Abstract: 'The mortality rate of herpetofauna due to road accidents in one of the busiest tarmacked metalled roads of Durgapur, an industrial town of West Bengal, India was studied. Road survey for 27 days covering a total distance of 94.5 km was conducted. Within this span of time and the total stretch of road, 354 amphibians belonging to 6 species and 133 reptiles belonging to 11 species were observed to be killed in road-accidents. Among amphibians, Duttaphrynus melanostictus and amongst the reptiles Hemidactylus spp. were killed in highest numbers. The stretch of road under survey passed through different habitat patches like\xe2\x80\x99s agricultural land, human habitation, dumping area, fragmented forest and wetland. On an average, 18 herpetofauna was noted to be killed daily. It was difficult to identify the species as the key characters were missing in the remains in a few cases of road casualties. High road mortality of herpetofauna would surely affect the balance of adjoining ecosystems as well as may be crucial for the local herpetofaunal population attributes.'

Abstract: 'Recent years have witnessed a rise in sensitivity towards protection of natural genetic resources and the environment at the international level. This is evident from the implementation of the convention on biodiversity (CBD). To conserve and optimize utilization of its bioresources, India enacted the Biological Diversity Act 2002. The conservation and management of aquatic resources is important for sustainable utilization of fisheries potential for the economic advancement of farmers and fishery workers, today as well as for posterity. As the biotechnological and genomic revolutions are ready to take off, the sovereign rights of native inhabitants to intellectual property rights (IPR) related to aquatic genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge are also integral components of management strategies for genetic resources.'

Abstract: 'We evaluated trained listener\xe2\x80\x94based acoustic sampling as a reliable and non-invasive method for rapid assessment of ensiferan species diversity in tropical evergreen forests. This was done by evaluating the reliability of identification of species and numbers of calling individuals using psychoacoustic experiments in the laboratory and by comparing psychoacoustic sampling in the field with ambient noise recordings made at the same time. The reliability of correct species identification by the trained listener was 100 % for 16 out of 20 species tested in the laboratory. The reliability of identifying the numbers of individuals correctly was 100% for 13 out of 20 species. The human listener performed slightly better than the instrument in detecting low frequency and broadband calls in the field, whereas the recorder detected high frequency calls with greater probability. To address the problem of pseudoreplication during spot sampling in the field, we monitored the movement of calling individuals using focal animal sampling. The average distance moved by calling individuals for 17 out of 20 species was less than 1.5\xc2\xa0m in half an hour. We suggest that trained listener\xe2\x80\x94based sampling is preferable for crickets and low frequency katydids, whereas broadband recorders are preferable for katydid species with high frequency calls for accurate estimation of ensiferan species richness and relative abundance in an area.'

Abstract: 'The present study was undertaken in five major forest types (dominated by Quercus semecarpifolia, Quercus floribunda, Acer acuminatum, Abies pindrow and Aesculus indica, respectively) between 2400 and 2850 m a.s.l. in a moist temperate forest of the Mandal-Chopta area in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand, India. The aim was to assess the variation in composition and diversity in different vegetation layers, i.e., herb, shrub and tree, among these five forest types. Diversity indices, such as the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, density, total basal cover, Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s concentration of dominance index, Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s diversity index, Pielou\xe2\x80\x99s equitability, species richness, species heterogeneity and \xce\xb2-diversity, were calculated to understand community structures. Dominance-diversity curves were drawn to ascertain resource apportionment among various species in different forest types.'

Abstract: 'The present work aimed to evaluate the riparian species diversity of five subwatersheds of the Meenachil river basin (1208.1\xc2\xa0km2) and to compare that with the main river channel. A total of 441 species were recorded belonging to 106 families. The Leguminosae was represented by the highest number of species (39 spp.) followed by Poaceae (25 spp.). The quantitative features such as density and importance value index of species varied greatly. In the present study, the diversity index of shrubs and herbs was found to be higher than the tree species. The concentration of dominance was recorded highest in the tree species. Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Wiener index (H\xe2\x80\xb2) ranged from 1.0 to 2.95. The Margalef\xe2\x80\x99s species richness index varied from 2.43 to 6.69, equitability or evenness index varied from 0.62 to 1.42, the species heterogeneity index varied from 0.4 to 0.83, and Mc Intosh diversity index varied from 56.57 to 329.27. A greater number of tree species fell in 41\xe2\x80\x9360\xc2\xa0cm girth at breast height, but less number of tree individuals is represented in above 100-cm diameter class.'

Abstract: 'Plant diversity plays key ecological roles in forest ecosystems, including influencing succession, resilience and nutrient cycling. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of livestock grazing and human uses on herbaceous species diversity. We surveyed 50 ha of protected area and 50 ha of unprotected area to evaluate herbaceous species diversity in oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) forests in northern Iran. We calculated and compared three indices each of diversity and evenness, and species richness between the two areas. Herbaceous cover was higher in the unprotected area while leaf litter depth and tree canopy cover were higher in the protected area. The diversity indices, H (Shannon-Wiener index), N1 (McArthur index), N2 (Hill\xe2\x80\x99s index), EQ (Modified Nee index), Evar (Smith-Wilson index), E5 (modified index of Hill) and R=S (species richness) and species richness R=S were greater in the protected area than in the unprotected area, suggesting that protection from grazing results in increased numbers of plants and species. The effect of land protection on plant diversity was more pronounced for evenness than for species richness and the positive correlation between diversity and evenness indices was higher than that between diversity and richness.'

Abstract: 'Small-fruited bitter gourds, the \xe2\x80\x9cpavel\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpandi-pavel\xe2\x80\x9d described in Hortus Malabaricus, is nearly an extinct crop in Kerala and rest of southern peninsular India. They are reported to have been cultivated extensively in the past. However, presently its cultivation is restricted to a few home gardens in remote forest areas consequent on its replacement by large-fruited cultivars over the last two centuries. Special traits like unique flavour, taste, medicinal properties and fruit fly tolerance have enabled the perpetuation of this relict vegetable still in a few homesteads. Eleven named landraces have been collected from South Western Ghats and Tamil Nadu plains and their seeds conserved in the genebank of NBPGR, New Delhi. Known as \xe2\x80\x9cuchie\xe2\x80\x9d in Northern India and \xe2\x80\x9cmethipavai\xe2\x80\x9d in Tamil, these miniature bitter gourds have different landrace names in specific pockets of natural occurrence/cultivation.'

Abstract: 'In order to examine the spatial distribution of forest resources on local territories and to understand the factors controlling such distributions, we studied the spatial patterns of a group of 23 useful plant species on the territory of a Kuna community in the province of Darien, Panama. A stratified random sampling scheme was used to survey the distribution and abundance of the species across a 3500 ha area around the village. Data on the physical environment as well as the geographic coordinates of the sample plots were also obtained. A series of canonical analyses was conducted to evaluate the species\xe2\x80\x93environment relationships and to identify spatial structures in the species distributions left unexplained by the environmental variables. Four distinct distribution patterns were identified among the species; these were most strongly explained by land-use, the degree of canopy closure and topography. Significant spatial structures, independent of the measured environmental variables, were related to anthropogenic pressure and an edaphic gradient, and the habitat associations of the individual species were described. The results obtained from this case study suggest that land-use dynamics may play a predominant role in structuring inhabited landscapes, and that diversity in distribution patterns and habitat associations will require a combination of spatially explicit management strategies to ensure the local resource base.'

Abstract: 'Apex predators fulfil potentially vital ecological roles. Typically wide-ranging and charismatic, they can also be useful surrogates for biodiversity preservation, making their targeted conservation imperative. The Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya), an endangered, endemic sub-species, is the island\xe2\x80\x99s apex predator. Of potential keystone importance, this carnivore also fulfills \xe2\x80\x9cumbrella\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cflagship\xe2\x80\x9d criterion and is of high ecological and existence value. Apex predator conservation requires identifying factors underlying distribution, so we used multi-scale maximum entropy modelling with sampling bias correction to investigate a broad suite of relevant ecological, climatic and anthropogenic factors in order to identify potentially suitable leopard habitat. Presence locations were determined from 15\xc2\xa0years of surveys, observations and verified reports. The best bias correction procedure and scale were uncertain, so we employed a novel method of using information from all models across analyses to determine top models and identify influential variables. Leopard presence was most strongly linked to the landscape proportion encompassed by Protected Areas strictly limiting human presence, with more porous Protected Areas less influential. All three forest composition and configuration metrics investigated (area weighted mean patch size, patch density and forest connectivity) were influential, with increased patch size and higher connectivity predicting better habitat suitability for leopards. Habitat suitability was also better where cropland extent and urban patch size were small. In summary, ground-level protection and natural forest extent and connectivity are of profound importance to Sri Lankan leopard distribution and are key factors in ensuring the ecological integrity of the island\xe2\x80\x99s faunal assemblages.'

Abstract: 'Plant wealth and diversity of four sacred groves \xe2\x80\x93 twoanthropogenic stands and two natural forest patches \xe2\x80\x93 along the southeastcoast of India adjoining Pondicherry was studied. A total of 111species, belonging to 103 genera in 53 families, were recorded from thefour sites, which together measure 15.6 ha. The number of woody species (girth at breast height(gbh) \xe2\x89\xa420 cm) was 20 each in Keezbuvanagiri (KBG) andKilialamman (KLM) grove, followed by 13 in Periyakattupalayam (PKP) and 15in Periyamudaliar chavadi (PMC). Based on the important value index (IVI), PMCgrove is an association of Aglaia elaeagnoidea,Borassus flabellifer and Pterospermumsuberifolium. A two-layered forest structure resembling tropical dryevergreen forest (TDEF) was found there. Stratification was obscured in the KBGgrove, as the scrub species were abundant, indicating a scrub woodland formation.PKP and KLM were characterised by the abundance of a few species. The presenceof a stout liana of Secamone emetica (gbh 35cm), the robustness of Cretaeva magna (gbh 220cm), Syzigium cumini (gbh 207.45cm), P. suberifolium (gbh 128.7cm) and Tamarindus indica (gbh 250cm), and survival of evergreen species like A.elaeagnoidea and Pamburus missionis isbotanically significant; Polyalthia suberosa is a raretaxon found only within the groves. The persistence of the groves until thepresent time is a testimony to the sacred grove status enjoyed by them.'

Abstract: 'Cloud forests in central Guatemala are fragmented and decreasing in area due to slash-and-burn agricultural activities. We studied bird species composition, abundance, guild composition, and site tenacity of a 102\xc2\xa0ha plot located in a cloud forest region of the Sierra Yalijux in Guatemala, half of which was primary forest and half young secondary forest (<7-years-old). Of the 100 species present 14 were restricted to the Endemic Bird Area \xe2\x80\x98Northern Central American highlands\xe2\x80\x99 (i.e. 66% of a total of 21 endemics). Five of the 100 analysed species, including one of the restricted-range species (Troglodytes rufociliatus), had a significantly different abundance in primary and secondary forests. Theoretical analysis suggests that seven species out of a community comprised of 141 bird species are already extirpated and only three out of the 14 present restricted-range species might survive the current state of deforestation. Insectivores were the dominant guild on the plot in terms of numbers of species, followed by omnivores, frugivores and granivores. However, in terms of individuals, omnivores made up nearly half of the bird individuals in primary forest, but declined by 44% in secondary forest, whereas granivores more than doubled in this habitat type. Numbers of species per guild were not significantly different between habitats, while numbers of individuals per guild were significantly different. In general, individuals per species are significantly different in the two habitats. Results suggest that most of the species that are currently surviving in the remnant forests of the Sierra Yalijux might be fairly well adapted to a range of forest conditions, but that populations of a number of restricted-range species might be small. Even generalists species like the Common Bush Tanager (Chlorospingus ophthalmicus) are less abundant in secondary vegetation than in primary forest of the study plot.'

Abstract: 'The study explores the use of multiple criteria decision techniques in predicting spatial niche of Brown oak (also known as Kharsu oak, Quercus semecarpifolia Sm.) formation in midaltitude (2,400\xe2\x80\x933,500 meter amsl) Kumaun Himalaya. Predictive models using various climatic and topographical factors influencing Brown oak\xe2\x80\x99s growth and survival were developed to define its current ecological niche. Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) method involving Saaty\xe2\x80\x99s pair-wise comparison was performed to rank the explanatory powers of each compared variable. Variables were suitably weighted using fuzzy factor standardization scheme to reflect their relative importance in defining species niche. An optimum indicator was then chosen for deriving a site suitability map of brown oak. This study establishes the role of aspect in the current distribution of the species along with known influence of altitude. Future niches of oak has been tracked in the projected climate change scenario of +1\xc2\xb0C and +2\xc2\xb0C rise in temperature and 20 mm in precipitation. The results show that on predicted +1\xc2\xb0C and +2\xc2\xb0C increase in temperature, present habitat of brown oak distribution may be reduced by 40 per cent and 76 per cent respectively.'

Abstract: 'Monitoring forest cover change and understanding the dynamic of forest cover is increasingly important in sustainable development and management of forest ecosystems. This paper uses remote sensing (RS) techniques to monitor forest cover change in Ma\xc3\xa7kaState Forest Enterprise (MSFE) located in NE of Turkey through 1975 to 2000 and then analyses spatial and temporal changes in forest cover by Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and FRAGSTATS\xe2\x84\xa2. Forest cover changes were detected from a time series of satellite images of Landsat MSS in 1975, Landsat TM in 1987, and Landsat ETM+ in 2000 using RS and GIS. The results showed that total forest area, productive forest area and degraded forest area increased while broadleaf forest area and non forest area decreased. Mixed forest and degraded forest increased during the first (1975\xe2\x80\x931987) period, but decreased during the second (1987\xe2\x80\x932000) period. During the whole study period, the annual forestation rate was 152 ha year\xe2\x88\x921, equivalent to 0.27% year\xe2\x88\x921 using the compound-interest-rate formula. The total number of patches increased from 36,204 to 48,092 (33%), and mean size of forest patch (MPS) decreased from 2.8 ha to 2.1 ha during a 25 year period. Number of smaller patches (patches in 0\xe2\x80\x93100 ha size class) increased, indicating more fragmented landscape over time that might create a risk for the maintenance of biodiversity of the area. While total population increased from 1975 to 2000 (3.7%), rural population constantly decreased. The increase of forest areas may well be explained by the fact that demographic movement of rural areas concentrated intoMa\xc3\xa7ka City Center. These figures also indicated that decrease in the rural population might likely lead to the release of human pressure to forest areas, probably resulting in a positive development of forest areas.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests play a crucial role as source and sink in global carbon cycle. Development and other anthropogenic activities have led to degradation of forest land, and ultimately, it results in loss of biodiversity and increases concentration of CO2 in atmospheres. Therefore, there is urgent need to estimate regional and national level carbon stock for making forest-based policies and strategies for mitigation of CO2. Patchy and sporadic information is available on biomass and carbon stock of Indian forests. The paper presents a systematic review and comprehensive account of studies conducted in different forest types in India.'

Abstract: 'This paper provides a suitable framework for consolidating knowledge and providing a useful starting point to undertake conservation of the last remnants of Butea monosperma forest. A survey was conducted to assess the status of a reportedly unexplored B. monosperma forest in a narrow strip of land along the northeastern region of Pakistan in order to conserve the remaining remnants. A preliminary reconnaissance survey on the basis of land use divides the narrow stretch of land, with concentration of remnants into four zones. The remnants were further evaluated for in situ conservation by a scoring system based on vegetation analysis and quality of habitat. Low value was assigned to those criteria which had negative impact and high to those which had positive impact on performance of B. monosperma and its long-term survival. Additional information, pertaining to decline, trends of change in the land use, and the underlying socioeconomic processes, was also made. Information from the study area indicated that, in the past two decades, the decline and conversion of the remaining B. monosperma forest to agriculture and forestry has been intensified. The vegetation analysis revealed that all remnants are broadly B. monosperma\xe2\x80\x93Adhatoda vasica, bispecies association. The scoring system ranked the remnants into four classes. Two forests from the intact remnant class and one from the mildly degraded class were recommended for in situ conservation. Keeping in view the deteriorating status of the highly ranked remnants across the landscape and the degree of alteration it is undergoing, they were assigned the conservation status category of \xe2\x80\x9ccritical.\xe2\x80\x9d An approach suggested for their immediate conservation was to fence them, with open access to the local people for sustainable resource use. In situ conservation of these benchmarks would help in further understanding the ecological, evolutionary, and structural features of this unique biogeographic ecotone and its affinities with the adjacent ecosystems.'

Abstract: ' Calophyllum apetalum and Garcinia morella, medicinal plants are endemic to Western Ghats, Karnataka, India. Sixteen Myrothecium isolates were obtained from the tissues of bark and twigs of these plants. The purpose of this study was to explore the antimicrobial activity and genetic variability of the endophytic Myrothecium isolates. The antimicrobial activity as well as the genetic diversity of endophytic Myrothecium species was investigated through RAPD, ISSR and ITS sequence analysis. Myrothecium isolates were genotypically compared by RAPD and ISSR techniques, 510 and 189 reproducible polymorphic bands were obtained using 20 RAPD and ten ISSR primers respectively. The isolates grouped into four main clades and subgroups using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean cluster analysis. rDNA ITS sequence analysis presented better resolution for characterising the isolates of Myrothecium spp. The clustering patterns of the isolates were almost similar when compared with RAPD and ISSR dendograms. The results signify that RAPD, ISSR and ITS analysis can be employed to distinguish the genetic diversity of the Myrothecium species. The endophytic and pathogenic strains were compared by maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and neighbour joining methods. One isolate (JX862206) amongst the 16 Myrothecium isolates exhibited potent antibacterial and as well as anti-Candida activity.'

Abstract: 'The present study is intended to analyze the occurrence of potent, low produce, naturally occurring stilbenes in protoplasts of wild species and hybrids of Dendrobium. The wild species selected for the study was Dendrobium ovatum, endemic to Western Ghats of India. Protoplasts were isolated from leaves and tepal tissues of all the species and were cultured purely to generate homofusants and cross-cultured to raise heterofusants. Phytochemical composition of protoplast culture with atypical and pure microcolonies was performed using mass spectrometry. Enzyme cocktail of 4% pectinase together with 2% cellulase displayed the highest competence for protoplast isolations. Maximum protoplast density of 30.11\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0104/ml was obtained from D. ovatum leaves in 2\xc2\xa0h. Subcellular features such as the presence of partially formed cell wall, the position of the nucleus, chloroplast density, colony existence, and integrity of the plasma membrane were analyzed. Among the pure and cross-cultured protoplasts, the number of heterofusants and homofusants formed were enumerated. The spectral feature extraction of the mass spectrometry indicated the presence of five phenolic marker compounds, viz., tristin, confusarin, gigantol, moscatilin, and resveratrol, some of them in pure and others in assorted protoplast cultures raised from Dendrobium leaves and tepals. The study demonstrated that protoplast fusion technique enabled phytochemical assemblage in vitro as stilbenes tend to get restricted either in a tissue or species specific manner. This is the first report showing the presence of resveratrol, moscatilin, tristin, gigantol, and confusarin in wild and hybrid species from cultured Dendrobium protoplasts in vitro.'

Abstract: 'The proposed work describes a protocol for high-frequency in vitro regeneration through nodal segments and shoot tips in Decalepsis arayalpathra, a critically endangered medicinal liana of the Western Ghats. Nodal segments were more responsive than shoot tips in terms of shoot proliferation. Murashige and Skoog\xe2\x80\x99s (MS) basal medium supplemented with 5.0 \xce\xbcM 6-benzyladenine (BA) was optimum for shoot initiation through both the explants. Among different combinations of plant growth regulators and growth additive screened, MS medium added with 5.0 \xce\xbcM BA + 0.5 \xce\xbcM indole-3-acetic acid + 20.0 \xce\xbcM adenine sulphate effectuated the highest response: 11.8 shoots per nodal segment and 5.5 shoots per shoot tip with mean shoot length of 9.2 and 4.8 cm, respectively. Half-strength MS medium with 2.5 \xce\xbcM \xce\xb1-naphthalene acetic acid was optimum for in vitro root induction. The plantlets with the well developed shoot and root were acclimatized in Soilrite\xe2\x84\xa2 with 92 % survival rate in the field conditions. During acclimatization, chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate were gradually changed in dependence of formation of new leaves. Further, the changes in activities of antioxidant enzymes, i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR) as well as activity of carbonic anhydrase were also observed: a continuous rise in SOD activity, but a rise and fall in the activities of CAT, APX, and GR were also noticed. Maximum fresh mass (3.1 g plant-1), dry mass (0.35 g plant-1) of roots and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde content of 9.22 \xce\xbcg cm-3(root extract) were recorded after 8 weeks of acclimatization.'

Abstract: 'In this study we analyzed climate and crop yields data from Indian cardamom hills for the period 1978\xe2\x80\x932007 to investigate whether there were significant changes in weather elements, and if such changes have had significant impact on the production of spices and plantation crops. Spatial and temporal variations in air temperatures (maximum and minimum), rainfall and relative humidity are evident across stations. The mean air temperature increased significantly during the last 30\xc2\xa0years; the greatest increase and the largest significant upward trend was observed in the daily temperature. The highest increase in minimum temperature was registered for June (0.37\xc2\xb0C/18\xc2\xa0years) at the Myladumpara station. December and January showed greater warming across the stations. Rainfall during the main monsoon months (June\xe2\x80\x93September) showed a downward trend. Relative humidity showed increasing and decreasing trends, respectively, at the cardamom and tea growing tracts. The warming trend coupled with frequent wet and dry spells during the summer is likely to have a favorable effect on insect pests and disease causing organisms thereby pesticide consumption can go up both during excess rainfall and drought years. The incidence of many minor pest insects and disease pathogens has increased in the recent years of our study along with warming. Significant and slight increases in the yield of small cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum M.) and coffee (Coffea arabica), respectively, were noticed in the recent years.; however the improvement of yield in tea (Thea sinensis) and black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) has not been seen in our analysis.'

Abstract: 'Dam removal has been increasingly reported globally and is becoming an important approach for river management, restoration and environmental conservation in damming rivers. However, current limited knowledge of global trends in dam removal and related research may be potentially biased in terms of the geographic distribution and organisms studied. Such bias could mislead dam removal planning and management in different areas and ecological conservation for different taxa. In this study, we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed datasets of dam removal and publications of dam removal research using bibliometric methods. A total of 1449 dam removal documents were published from 1953 to 2016. Trends, current hotspots and future directions of dam removal research were identified. The results from this study reveal that dam removal largely occurred in the North America and Europe, and most of the removed dams were small and old dams. With respect to the topic analysis, more dam removal studies should focus on the responses of a wide range of organisms, not only fish, as well as the interspecies relationships, food webs and ecosystem structures and functions. Based on our findings, we also provide some suggestions for future dam removal planning and analysis.'

Abstract: 'Changes in species composition and density of trees >10 cm gbh in a tropical dry evergreen forest in Puthupet, south India are interpreted for the period between 1992 and 2002. A 1-ha plot was inventoried in 1992 and was recensused in 2002. During the 10-year interval tree taxa diversity as well as stand density increased, but the basal area value decreased. Tree species richness increased by 21% (from 24 to 29 species) by an addition of eight species and local extinction of three species. The tree density increased just by eight individuals (from 1330 stems ha\xe2\x88\x921 in 1992 to 1338 ha\xe2\x88\x921 in 2002), but the basal area decreased by 8% (from 37.5 to 34.5 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921). Many species (11 numbers) have increased in abundance rather than decreased. Many surviving species seem to have considerable stability in abundance at the local scale. The density of smaller stems (10 29 cm gbh) increased by 15.3%, while that of the larger trees decreased drastically (81.6%). Ninety percent of the missing stems were from the middlestorey of the forest. Tree density changes among the three ecological guilds revealed a decrease in stem density and an increase in basal area in the lowerstorey; while the middlestorey exhibited a reverse trend. Family-wise, tree density changes revealed that the majority of families (67%) showed an increase in stem density. Long-term studies on tree population changes are essential to estimate tree mortality and recruitment rates, which will provide a greater insight in tropical forest dynamics.'

Abstract: 'Geophysical resistivity survey was conducted in 35 locations along the foothills of Courtallam, Tamilnadu, in order to depict the groundwater potential zone. The layer parameters like apparent resistivity (\xcf\x81a) and thickness (h) of different layers were arrived. A maximum of four layers were identified in few regions, but major part of the study area is dominated mainly by three layers. Three major zones has been delineated as weathered, fractured and massive. Generally, A, H, KH type curve are dominant in this region and minor representation of HK is also observed. Resistivity and thickness of both the layers show decreased value in riparian zone. More resistivity and thickness along mountain front (MF) indicates good groundwater potential. The observed high conductivity in Southern part is symptomatic of the contaminated groundwater leached and drained into the subsurface from the agricultural regions. VES 6 and 13 along MF and VES 1, 3 and 12 along riparian zone are the probable locations for productive groundwater abstraction. Resistivity values and their corresponding depth for some selected VES locations were used in producing two resistivity cross sections (A\xe2\x80\x93B, C\xe2\x80\x93D), which show the geoelectric distribution of the subsurface near and away from the MF.'

Abstract: 'The Western Himalayan region of India possesses rich genetic diversity of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Rice landraces having withstood the rigors of biotic and abiotic stresses, suit to the local conditions of farms and reflect socio-cultural preferences can still be found in crop fields located distantly in rural and tribal areas. This region is known for growing World fame basmati in the foot hills and many varieties of red rices grown at higher elevations, known for cold tolerance and medicinal properties. Genetic resources of rice were collected for about 8\xc2\xa0years (1999\xe2\x80\x932006) and 1069 germplasm accessions including 154 named landraces were collected. Prominent landraces such as Begumi, Ramjwain, Thapachini, Naurang, Hansraj, Tilakchandan, Lalsati, Jhini, Mushakbudji, Jattoo, Barpasso, Qadirbeigh, Safedbrez, Shahie known for their special quality attributes were collected. The change in land use, cropping patterns and aggressive introduction of modern varieties in the region has resulted in the loss of a large number of landraces especially from irrigated lands. The present paper looks at the status of rice genetic resources, genetic variability, genetic erosion and future strategies to conserve rice germplasm on farm and to maximize its use in rice breeding.'

Abstract: 'The two species of yellow catfish, Horabagrus brachysoma and H. nigricollaris are categorized as \xe2\x80\x98endangered\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98critically endangered\xe2\x80\x99 respectively in their wild habitat. Proper knowledge of genetic structure and variability of these endangered species are highly essential for the management, conservation and improvement of fish stocks. Therefore, genetic variation and phylogenetic relationships between these species of yellow catfish sampled from Chalakkudy River in the hot spot of biodiversity-Western Ghats region, Kerala, India were analyzed by using Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and microsatellite markers. 85 RAPD and five microsatellites loci were detected to analyze the genetic variation and phylogenetic relationships among these species. Out of 85 RAPD loci produced only 52.94% were polymorphic whereas in microsatellite, all 5 loci were polymorphic (100%). Species-specific RAPD bands were found in both species studied. In microsatellite, the number of alleles across the five loci ranged from 1 to 8. The observed heterozygosities in H. brachysoma and H. nigricollaris were 0.463 and 0.443, respectively. Here, both RAPD and microsatellite methods reported a low degree of gene diversity and lack of genetic heterogeneity in both species of Horabagrus which strongly emphasize the need of fishery management, conservation and rehabilitation of these species.'

Abstract: 'A potential impact of climate change in the south Asian context in general and the Indian subcontinent in particular is an increase in rainfall, in some areas up to 50%. Using an extensive information base available on the dynamics of landscape structure and function of the northeastern hill areas of India, scenarios on landscape changes, as an adaptation to climate change, have been constructed. Climate change would impose a variety of stresses on sustainable livelihood of the inhabitants of the rain-forested areas through stresses on ecosystem function. It is concluded that appropriate management strategies for natural forests and plantation forestry should go hand in hand with a comprehensive rural ecosystem rehabilitation plan.'

Abstract: 'Tree species richness, tree density, basal area, population structure and distribution pattern were investigated in undisturbed, mildly disturbed, moderately disturbed and highly disturbed stands of tropical wet evergreen forests of Arunachal Pradesh. The forest stands were selected based on the disturbance index (the basal area of the cut trees measured at ground level expressed as a fraction of the total basal area of all trees including felled ones): (i) undisturbed stand (0% disturbance index), (ii) mildly disturbed (20% disturbance index), (iii) moderately disturbed (40% disturbance index), and (iv) highly disturbed stand (70% disturbance index). Tree species richness varied along the disturbance gradient in different stands. The mildly disturbed stand showed the highest species richness (54 of 51 genera). Species richness was lowest (16 of 16 genera) in the highly disturbed stand. In the undisturbed stand, 47 species of 42 genera were recorded while in the moderately disturbed stand 42 species of 36 genera were found. The Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Wiener diversity index for tree species ranged from 0.7 to 2.02 in all the stands. The highest tree diversity was recorded in the undisturbed stand and the lowest in the highly disturbed stand. The stands differed with respect to the tree species composition at the family and generic level. Fagaceae, Dipterocarpaceae and Clusiaceae dominated over other families and contributed 53% in the undisturbed, 51% in the mildly disturbed, 42% in the moderately disturbed and 49% in the highly disturbed forest stands to the total density of the respective stand. Stand density was highest (5452 stems ha\xe2\x88\x921) in the undisturbed stand, followed by the mildly disturbed stand (5014), intermediate (3656) in the moderately disturbed stand and lowest (338) in the highly disturbed stand. Dominance, calculated as the importance value index of different species, varied greatly across the stands. The highest stand density and species richness were represented in the medium girth class (51\xe2\x80\x93110 cm) in all the stands. In the undisturbed stand, the highest density was found in the 111\xe2\x80\x93140 cm girth class, while in the mildly disturbed stand the 51\xe2\x80\x9380 cm girth range recorded the highest density. About 55, 68 and 52% species were found to be regenerating in the undisturbed, mildly disturbed and moderately disturbed stands, respectively. No regeneration was recorded in the highly disturbed stand. Variation in species richness, distribution pattern and regeneration potential is related to human interference and the need for forest conservation is emphasized.'

Abstract: 'High-frequencyin vitro flowering is reported here fromin vitro regenerated shoots ofin vitro-raised seedlings of rare and endemicCeropegia lawii, Ceropegia maccannii, Ceropegia oculata, andCeropegia sahyadrica, as well as the widely distributedCeropegia bulbosa var.bulbosa andCeropegia hirsuta. In our first set of experiments, the MS medium contained 87 mM sucrose and was supplemented with varying concentrations of BAP (4.4 to 26.6 \xc2\xb5M). For the second set of trials, varying concentrations of sucrose (87 to 233 mM) were tested in MS media containing a constant 4.4 p.M BAP. Sub-cultured apical as well as axillary buds flowered with similar frequencies after 30 d of incubation. For all six species, the highest percentage of flowering shoots was obtained with either 26.6 \xc2\xb5M BAP or 175 mM sucrose. Although smaller in size, theirin vitro flowers were morphologically comparable within wVo-derived flowers. Variations among species were noted for the number of flower buds per shoot and the percentage of flower formation. Because all six species showed similar responses in both experiments, we can suggest that this protocol is applicable across the wide range ofCeropegia species.'

Abstract: 'A new and interesting species of Sporidesmium was discovered during a survey of plant debris inhibiting litter decomposing microfungi in Binser forest, Almora, Uttarakhand, India. This new species, Sporidesmium binserum sp. nov., a dematiaceous  hyphomycete was found on decaying leaf litter of the host plant Quercus leucotrichophora (oak). The key features of special interest that distinguish it from other morphologically similar species of Sporidesmium are macronematous, mononematous, percurrent proliferations towards the end in the flexuous multiseptate conidiophores with obtuse tip having distinctively curved, fusiform to subfusiform, 3-septate conidia, consist of 3 cells, second cell dark brown with slightly or distinctly constricted at the septa, tip cell of conidia highly curved and/or twisted, mostly flat and conic-truncated ends at base due to schizolytic secession. The conidial maturation is presumably synchronous with conidial ontogeny. Based on these features, the specimen is proposed here as a new species. Apart from it, a note on the current status of Sporidesmium sensu lato in India is also provided.'

Abstract: 'The Cauvery river basin of South India has a large phyto-floristic wealth, rightfully enough to constitute a separate phyto-geographic unit. Increase in the anthropogenic pressures within the river basin and surrounding landscapes have persistently stressed the riparian ecosystem structure adversely, besides altering its composition. The objective of this study was to examine the present status of riparian vegetation along the Cauvery river basin, in response to anthropogenic pressures. For vegetation analysis, the riparian forest coming in the middle stretch of Cauvery river was categorized into two zones, viz., forest zone covering ~54\xc2\xa0km stretch and agroecosystem zone covering ~80\xc2\xa0km stretch. In each zone, tree species were quantified using transects at 8-km interval. Overall tree species accounting for both forest and agroecosystem were recorded and compared. The results indicate that the mean density and basal area of trees per plot were higher in the forest zone than agroecosystem zone. The Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Weiner diversity of forest zone is 4.6, which is higher than agroecosystem. In addition, species composition indicated a relatively low or poor similarity between the two zones. The vegetation density and site disturbance scores for all the study sites reveals that sand mining and grazing areas have exerted negative impact on riparian forest. The results of the present study clearly brought out the need for preparing and implementing site-specific conservation plans for riparian ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'Environmental, biological, socio-cultural and economic status variation existing in the Central Himalaya have led to the evolution of diverse and unique traditional agroecosystems, crop species and livestock, which facilitate the traditional mountain farming societies to sustain themselves. Indigenous agroecosystems are highly site specific and differ from place to place, as they have evolved along divergent lines. For maintenance of traditional agrodiversity management the farmers of the Central Himalaya have evolved various types of crop rotations in consonance with the varied environmental conditions and agronomic requirements. In irrigated flat lands two crops are harvested in a year with negligible fallow period but in rainfed conditions if a cropping sequence is presumed to be starting after winter fallow phase then four major cropping seasons can be identified namely first kharif season (first crop season), first rabi season (second crop season), second kharif season (third crop season) and second rabi season (fourth crop season). Highest crop diversity is present in kharif season in comparison to rabi season. Traditionally the fields are left fallow after harvest of the second kharif season crop. Important characteristics of agrodiversity management are the use of bullocks for draught power, human energy as labour, crop residues as animal feed and animal waste mixed with forest litter as organic input to restore soil fertility levels. Women provide most of the human labour except for ploughing and threshing grain. The present study deals with assessment of traditional agrodiversity management such as (i) crop diversity, (ii) realized yield under the traditional practices and (iii) assess the differences of realized yields under sole and mixed cropping systems. It indicated that crop rotation is an important feature of the Central Himalayan village ecosystem which helps to continue the diversity of species grown, as are the distribution of crops in the growing period and the management of soil fertility. The cropping diversity existing and the sequences practiced by the traditional farmers seems to have achieved high degree of specialization and thus even when the yield/biomass variations are about 60%, the farmers continue to practice these sequences as they need to maintain diversity and synergistic relationships of crops in addition to manage the food and labour requirements for crop husbandry. Crop yields are generally higher in irrigated systems than rainfed systems and in sole cropping as compared with mixed cropping. However, gross biological and economic yields are higher in mixed cropping than sole cropping systems.'

Abstract: 'Lichens are a classic example of symbiosis, being an association between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner that can be either an alga or a cyanobacterium or both. A lot is now known about the physiological interactions between the two and about the composite thallus which makes this group of organisms especially valuable as biological monitors. Several books* have also dealt with this topic; however they have focused on temperate regions of the world. The Indian subcontinent, and other warmer regions of Asia, have a rich lichen flora but at the same time pollution levels in many areas are high and have increased dramatically in recent decades. Hence a book to instruct scientists and others about lichens and encourage their use for monitoring changes in diversity and the environment is most welcome. Unfortunately, this book is like the curate\xe2\x80\x99s egg, good in parts. It reviews a lot of material, is attractively produced with illustrations in colour, and it has a good bibliography....'

Abstract: ' The allozyme variation and population genetic structure of Horabagrus brachysoma in three natural populations from the southern part of the Western Ghats region, India, were investigated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Variations at 14 loci from 14 enzyme systems were analyzed. The allozyme analysis revealed a high level of genetic variation in this species, with an average of observed alleles per locus of 2.357 and observed heterozygosity of 0.178. The positive value of the fixation index (F IS\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.507) implied a significant deficiency of heterozygosity at the population level. The highly significant probability (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.0001) for the overall loci suggested that the three sample sets were not part of the same gene pool. '

Abstract: 'Treefall gap, canopy opening caused by the death of one or more trees, is the dominant form of disturbance in many forest systems worldwide. Gaps play an important role in forest ecology helping to preserve bio- and pedo-diversity, influencing nutrient cycles, and maintaining the complex structure of the late-successional forests. Over the last 30 years, numerous reviews have been written describing gap dynamics. Here we synthesize current understanding on gap dynamics relating to tree regeneration with particular emphasis on gap characteristics considered critical to develop ecologically sustainable forest management systems and to conserve native biodiversity. Specifically, we addressed the question: how do gaps influence forest structure? From the literature reviewed, the size of gaps induces important changes in factors such as light intensity, soil humidity and soil biological properties that influence tree species regeneration and differ in gaps of different sizes. Shadetolerant species can colonize small gaps; shade-intolerant species need large gaps for successful regeneration. Additionally, gap dynamics differ between temperate, boreal, and tropical forests, showing the importance of climate differences in driving forest regeneration. This review summarizes information of use to forest managers who design cutting regimes that mimic natural disturbances and who must consider forest structure, forest climate, and the role of natural disturbance in their designs.'

Abstract: 'In a number of places, sacred forest sites play an important role in conservation and local livelihoods. Here we examine how Iban hunters and animals alike use sacred forest in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. To determine the relative importance of different sites in hunting, we compare hunting effort, animal species and their numbers encountered by hunters, and encounters and captures in a variety of forest sites including sacred groves. We relate the results to the role of such sites in the overall Iban agroforestry system and in the conservation of forest habitat that professional conservationists deem precious. Such land use practices, while having social and religious origins, may be important for local economic purposes, but they may also be valuable in promoting and enhancing the more global goals of biodiversity conservation.'

Abstract: 'In recent years, invasion of native grasslands by exotic woody plants has been recognized as a global problem with multiple adverse ecological and socio-economic consequences. Reasons for such expansions are numerous, including fire suppression. An important example of this problem is the native montane grassland in the Nilgiris of the Western Ghats in India, a biodiversity hotspot threatened by invasion of multiple woody species. In this study, the impacts of the highly invasive, nitrogen fixing exotic shrub Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) on the grassland community and ecosystem function have been quantified and the role of fire as a potential management tool evaluated. I established paired plots in uninvaded and broom-invaded grasslands that were either unburned or burned by an unplanned wildfire event. Invasion negatively impacted the grassland community structure and composition, favoring shade tolerant and weedy native plants, but did not greatly alter ecosystem function. Burning broom patches to eliminate the stands resulted in lower soil moisture and nitrogen levels 18\xc2\xa0months after the fire. Yet, there were no notable fire effects on the grassland communities or ecosystem properties. Taken together, the results suggest that fire might be an effective tool for broom control. At the end of the study period burned-broom communities did not become more similar to uninvaded-grasslands; presumably the recovery process may be slow without additional management intervention.'

Abstract: 'We examine the dynamics and spatial determinants of land change in India by integrating decadal land cover maps (1985\xe2\x80\x931995\xe2\x80\x932005) from a wall-to-wall analysis of Landsat images with spatiotemporal socioeconomic database for ~630,000 villages in India. We reinforce our results through collective evidence from synthesis of 102 case studies that incorporate field knowledge of the causes of land change in India. We focus on cropland\xe2\x80\x93fallow land conversions, and forest area changes (excludes non-forest tree categories including commercial plantations). We show that cropland to fallow conversions are prominently associated with lack of irrigation and capital, male agricultural labor shortage, and fragmentation of land holdings. We find gross forest loss is substantial and increased from ~23,810\xc2\xa0km2 (1985\xe2\x80\x931995) to ~25,770\xc2\xa0km2 (1995\xe2\x80\x932005). The gross forest gain also increased from ~6000\xc2\xa0km2 (1985\xe2\x80\x931995) to ~7440\xc2\xa0km2 (1995\xe2\x80\x932005). Overall, India experienced a net decline in forest by ~18,000\xc2\xa0km2 (gross loss\xe2\x80\x93gross gain) consistently during both decades. We show that the major source of forest loss was cropland expansion in areas of low cropland productivity (due to soil degradation and lack of irrigation), followed by industrial development and mining/quarrying activities, and excessive economic dependence of villages on forest resources.'

Abstract: 'Compilation of alien flora from phytogeographically distinct regions is of immediate relevance not only for better understanding the patterns of plant invasion but also for explicating the processes promoting invasion at local, regional or global scales. Despite being at higher risk of invasion by plants because of its European colonial past, south Asia has received very little attention in respect of characterization of its alien flora. This paucity of baseline data necessitated compilation of the first catalogue of alien flora from the Kashmir Himalaya\xe2\x80\x94a phytogeographically distinct south Asian region nestled in the northwestern folds of Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. Total alien flora of the region is represented by 571 plant species, belonging to 352 genera and 104 families. It constitutes a relatively higher (29%) proportion of the total flora of the region. Families with largest number of alien representatives are Poaceae (60 species), Asteraceae (54 species), and Brassicaceae (30 species). However, families such as Amaranthaceae (83%) and Chenopodiacae (71%) show higher percentage of aliens relative to their total number of plant species in the region. Most of the alien plant species (38%) trace their origin to Europe, followed by Asia (27%) and Africa (15%). Present study also reports, for the first time, occurrence of seven plant species in this region. Each alien plant species is provided with information on the origin, habit, mode/purpose of introduction, current invasion status, altitudinal range and the primary published source.'

Abstract: 'We critically discuss the impact of sustainable development initiatives in Kerala, India, on biodiversity and on women farmers in the matrilineal Adivasi community of the Kurichya-tribe in Wayanad. By contextualizing development programs regarding the specifically gendered access to land, division of labor, distribution of knowledge and decision-making power, we situate our analysis within the theoretical framework of feminist political ecology. We first outline women\xe2\x80\x99s gaining of social and political space in local self-government institutions (Panchayath) and then critically discuss the impacts of women\xe2\x80\x99s farming groups (Joint Liability Groups: JLGs). Decentralization and development programs have aimed at empowering women and reducing poverty through improved food security. However, little success has materialized, as patriarchal power structures concerning decision-making processes as well as control over the most valuable resources (land and rice) and traditional knowledge have been maintained. Whereas women\xe2\x80\x99s self-help groups (Kudumbasree) in Kerala have enhanced their position, women\xe2\x80\x99s farming groups (JLGs), by contrast, have brought little betterment. In some cases they have even downsized women\xe2\x80\x99s management and knowledge of resources related to agriculture and do not integrate or enhance Kurichya women\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge. As some women are now introducing high-yielding rice seeds and fertilizer and as it is impossible for them to control land and get access to traditional rice seeds\xe2\x80\x94the domain of men\xe2\x80\x94we contest the notion of women being considered the preservers of agrobiodiversity.

Abstract: 'The subterranean parts of many wild plants form an important constituent of traditional diet of the tribal inhabitants of Similipal Biosphere Reserve, Odisha especially in times of food scarcity during critical periods. However, no specific study has been made so far on this aspect. The present study was conducted during 2008\xe2\x80\x932012 as a search for sources of food and to assess the dietary diversity, consumption pattern, culinary uses and prioritized species of wild tuberous plants sustained by local tribes. The exploration and germplasm collection missions along with intensive botanical survey, focus group discussions, structured household interview and market survey were conducted in 30 villages interacting with 102 key informants of core and buffer zones. A total of 55 wild edible tuberous species representing 37 genera and 24 families were inventoried including 17 species used during food deficiency to meet seasonal shortages. The analyzed data contributed 5 use categories, 4 preparation methods, 7 kinds of food items, 10 species as children snacks, 35 species of pharma-foods and 20 prioritized species. Ten species were domesticated by tribes thus reducing threats on wild tubers and 20 species were traded in local markets to generate additional income exemplifying economic benefits from wild tubers. Seventeen species were identified as novel uses of food items from India. The findings suggested that the nutritional profile along with pharmaceutical attributes of preferred wild food plants be analyzed for recommending suitable species for better nutrition and development of nutraceuticals. Further, many genetic resources of these wild tuberous species of agri-horticultural importance constitute the wild genepool hence their economic and breeding potential along with desirable attributes need to be investigated for utilization in crop improvement programmes.'

Abstract: 'We studied moist deciduous forests of Chhattisgarh, India (1) to assess the effect of four levels of historic wildland fire frequency (high, medium, low, and no-fire) on regeneration of seedlings in fire affected areas during pre and post-fire seasons, (2) to evaluate vegetation structure and diversity by layer in the four fire frequency zones, (3) to evaluate the impact of fire frequency on the structure of economically important tree species of the region, and (4) to quantify fuel loads by fire frequency level. We classified fire-affected areas into high, medium, low, and no-fire frequency classes based on government records. Tree species were unevenly distributed across fire frequency categories. Shrub density was maximum in zones of high fire frequency and minimum in low-frequency and no-fire zones. Lower tree density after fires indicated that regeneration of seedlings was reduced by fire. The population structure in the high-frequency zone was comprised of seedlings of size class (A) and saplings of size class (B), represented by Diospyros melanoxylon, Dalbergia sissoo, Shorea robusta and Tectona grandis. Younger and older trees were more abundant for Tectona grandis and Dalbargia sissoo after fire, whereas intermediate-aged trees were more abundant prefire, indicating that the latter age-class was thinned by the catastrophic effect of fire. The major contributing components of fuel load included duff litter and small woody branches and twigs on the forest floor. Total fuel load on the forest floor ranged from 2.2 to 3.38 Mg/ha. The net change in fuel load was positive in high- and medium-frequency fire zones and negative under low- and no-fire zones. Repeated fires, however, slowly reduced stand stability. An ecological approach is needed for fire management to restore the no-fire spatial and temporal structure of moist deciduous forests, their species composition and fuel loads. The management approach should incorporate participatory forest management. Use of controlled fire, fire lines and mapping of fire prone areas are fundamental principles of fire hazard reduction in these areas.'

Abstract: 'Literature on spot-billed pelican has not been reviewed lately which could provide a critique of the emerging data. We have now chosen it as a key species through which we suggest a conservation action plan which will benefit several waterbird species. The information provided here is scholastic in nature and is meant to focus on aspects that require attention and help plan future work for applied conservation. All known information on this species is brought together in this review which will also provide an update of its biology. Notes on the breeding biology of the species first published in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. So far, 380 works have appeared on the species; of these, 36 contain material reported in earlier works or appeared as papers subsequently. Most appeared as articles in journals, both national and regional, a few international journals, newsletters/bulletins (48.2%), 4 dissertations, 76 reports and 6 popular science articles in magazines. This review on the species will provide an insight into different factors that can be weighed and combined while making a decision in investing resources in species conservation, i.e. importance of the species, level of threat and the time frame over which results are to be achieved.'

Abstract: ' Shade coffee agroforestry systems have the potential to support biodiversity. Sustainable certification of coffee has been promoted as a means to provide incentives to maintain these systems, but as yet there is little evidence if this is effective. We analyzed tree diversity on smallholder organic and conventional farms in buffer zones of three conservation areas in Costa Rica, Guatemala and Nicaragua (the later included some large-scale conventional and Rainforest Alliance certified farms). Organic farms had greater farm level tree species richness and Shannon diversity compared to conventional farms; estimated native tree species richness across the landscape was probably greater on organic farms than conventional in Nicaragua (48 vs. 28 species respectively) and possibly in Guatemala (23 vs. 15 species respectively). Organic farms had higher shade levels and more tree strata than conventional farms. In Guatemala and Nicaragua tree species composition was not closely related to whether farms were organic or conventional, although within composition clusters, organic farms tended to have greater diversity. In contrast, organic and conventional farms in Costa Rica mostly belonged to different tree species clusters. In Nicaragua most large-scale farms, and all Rainforest certified farms, formed a distinct species composition cluster with presence of old-growth forest species and within which Rainforest farms had greater diversity. Tree species composition of the shade seems to be mainly due to management history; but certification effectively differentiates those farms with greater tree diversity. Longer-term monitoring is required to determine whether certification can be an incentive to conserve or expand biodiverse coffee agroforestry systems within the buffer zones around conservation areas.'

Abstract: 'Given the heavy reliance placed on and investment in protected areas for biological conservation, there has been much debate as to how effective these are in representing biodiversity features within their boundaries. The majority of studies addressing this issue have been conducted on a regional or national basis, precluding a broad picture of patterns of representation at the species level. We present a global assessment of the representation of the terrestrial geographic ranges of complete taxonomic groups: all known extant amphibians, birds and mammals (20,736 species) within the current global system of protected areas. We conclude that it is necessary substantially to improve the levels of coverage of the geographic ranges of the majority of species, even the widespread ones. This is particularly true for rare species, which might be assumed to be foci for protected area systems. To improve on the low levels of coverage of vertebrate ranges attained by the existing areas, key regions should be targeted, but heavy reliance will also have to be placed on approaches to sustaining populations in the wider, unprotected landscape.'

Abstract: 'Natural landscapes include more than the physical elements that are typically measured and assessed. Many current sites for studies of biological diversity have long supported human history in various ways, including spiritually. As some studies explicitly query human-environment interactions, ecological research focused outside of these interactions must come to terms with people living and depending on natural resources on the landscape. Religious values promise a beneficial meeting point of human interests and natural resource conservation, where both conservationists and local communities may find similar goals.'

Abstract: 'The prehistoric archaeology of Sri Lanka is of considerable significance for investigations of the evolution, dispersal and adaptation of our species within a variety of environments beyond Africa during the Late Pleistocene. \nIn particular, the archaeological and fossil sequences of Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Microlithic tradition\xe2\x80\x99, c. 38,000\xe2\x80\x933,000\xc2\xa0cal. years BP, have yielded some of the earliest Homo sapiens fossils, microlithic technologies, osseous toolkits, and evidence for symbolic ornamentation and long-distance contacts anywhere in South Asia. The further association of the Late Pleistocene portion of these records with the tropical rainforest of Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s Wet Zone also makes Sri Lanka of particular interest for debates regarding the viability of tropical rainforest for early human foraging and specialization. Yet beyond mentions of its fossil evidence, the archaeology and palaeoenvironmental contexts of the \xe2\x80\x98Microlithic tradition\xe2\x80\x99 have remained little-explored in the international literature. Here we present the first critical review of this period of Sri Lankan prehistory, examining its local chronologies, the spatial and diachronic patterns of its material cultural sequence, and relating its technological and fossil record to broader international archaeological, anthropological and genetic debates.'

Abstract: 'A number of wild plants, used by rural and tribal populations and contributing significantly to their livelihood and food security have escaped recognition and scientific inquiry. Their distribution, conservation, mode of harvest by locals and optimal use require region-specific assessment in order to integrate them into developmental interventions. This study analyzed the collection, consumption, sale and income from edible forest fruits in 49 tribal villages spread over five districts of Orissa State in eastern India. Density, dominance and diversity of species yielding wild fruit were measured by studying ecological parameters in the sample plots. We estimated an average of 48 fruit plants per hectare of deciduous forests. Fifty-six wild edible fruit species belonging to 40 genera in 26 families were recorded in the study region, many of which have multiple uses. Indigenous fruits formed part of the family diet with average annual consumption of 73\xc2\xa0kg per household. Sale of wild fruits contributed 15\xc2\xa0% of income for tribal households. Despite their good knowledge of indigenous fruits, the tribal populations have not adopted fruit tree farming which would enhance their nutrition and income.'

Title: 'Extraction of non-timber forest products in the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills, India. 4. impact on floristic diversity and population structure in a thorn scrub forest'

Abstract: 'Impact of extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) was analyzed in a thorn scrub forest in Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) wildlife sanctuary, India. Six species are most commonly extracted from BRT scrub for subsistence and income generation by an aboriginal tribe, the Soliga. Although the forest has been provided protection from indiscriminate felling since 1978 under a wildlife sanctuary cover, changes in vegetation structure are still occurring as a consequence of anthropogenic pressure in the form of extraction of fuelwood and other NTFPs. The results indicate that large woody species are being replaced by small woody species. The population structure also is becoming increasingly skewed to the smaller size classes due to extraction-bound mortality of the individuals, particularly those>7 cm dbh and above. The data suggest that the scrub community itself may be a manifestation of long persisting anthropogenic pressure in the form of extraction of a variety of forest products, and it currently represents a downward transition from a deciduous forest to a shrub thicket.'

Title: 'Resolving the phylogenetic placement of Porobeltraniella and allied genera in the Beltraniaceae '

Abstract: 'The circumscription of Beltraniaceae has thus far been based on the unique morphological characters of its genera, although these assumptions have never been tested phylogenetically because of a lack of DNA sequence data. The Indian Western Ghats is rich with diverse strains of Beltrania and similar genera, and therefore an attempt was made to re-collect as many species as possible, to study their taxonomy, and to resolve their phylogeny based on LSU and ITS nrDNA sequences. This study provides the first phylogenetic placement of genera Beltraniella, Porobeltraniella, Pseudobeltrania and Hemibeltrania in the Beltraniaceae based on fresh specimens, type studies and molecular phylogenetic analyses. Furthermore, Subramaniomyces appears to be phylogenetically related to beltranioid genera, and is therefore included in Beltraniaceae. However, the phylogenies of the hyphomycete genus Parapleurotheciopsis and the perithecial genus Pidoplitchkoviella appear to change with data selection and phylogenetic analytical method used, and remain unresolved.'

Title: 'Diversity and genetic structure of teak (Tectona grandis L.f) in its natural range using DNA microsatellite markers'

Abstract: 'Teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) is considered to be an extraordinarily durable building timber with a worldwide reputation. Its widespread use has entailed the over-exploitation of natural forests and a large reduction in natural diversity. Fifteen microsatellite markers were used to study the genetic variability and structure of 166 teak trees distributed over the whole natural area of teak. Analysis showed that in the teak natural area there were four main centers of genetic variability. Two clusters were in India and could be considered as main centers of genetic diversity in teak. The third cluster mainly consisting of populations in Thailand and Laos was genetically very distinct from the Indian populations but presented only half as much allelic variability. A fourth cluster from Central Laos showed even less genetic variability. The use of SSR markers for conservation of teak forest diversity is discussed.'

Abstract: 'The Millennium Seed Bank (MSB) Partnership, developed and managed by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (RBG Kew), conserves propagules primarily from orthodox seed-bearing wild vascular plants. It is the largest ex situ conservation programme in the world, currently involving 96 countries and territories. Where possible, seeds are collected and conserved in the country of origin with duplicates being sent to RBG Kew\xe2\x80\x99s MSB for storage. In this paper we assess the conservation value of the germplasm stored at the MSB using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The MSB holdings represent a high quality, rich biological resource. Substantial and unique taxonomic diversity exists amongst the collections, representing 365 families, 5813 genera, 36,975 species and 39,669 taxa conserved. The collections cover a wide geographic range, originating from 189 countries and territories, representing all nine bio-geographic regions and all 35 biodiversity hotspots. The collections possess significant natural capital and population value: 32% of taxa, representing 49% of collections, have at least one identified use to humans; and 74% of taxa, representing 78% of collections, are either endemic, endangered (nationally or globally) and/or have an economic, ecological, social, cultural or scientific value. While 10% of taxa, representing >\xc2\xa08% of collections, are either extinct, rare or vulnerable to extinction at the global and/or national level, 20% of taxa, representing 13% collections, are endemic at the country or territory scale. Over the 17-year period since 2000 at least 11,182 seed samples, representing 12% of taxa and 8% of collections, have been distributed globally for conservation, research, education and display. This analysis highlighted collection gaps in MSB holdings in relation to their geographic representativeness, the taxonomic diversity of large families and genera of angiosperms, and coverage of threatened taxa. Further analysis across the entire MSB Partnership is required to underpin future collection activities and maximize the usefulness of collections.'

Title: 'Comparative efficiency and accuracy of variable area transects versus square plots for sampling tree diversity and density'

Abstract: 'Agroforestry systems have been recognized as areas with high conservation potential, and there is a need to quickly assess the biodiversity and tree stocking density available in these systems. However, it is not clear if the commonly used fixed area plot is most efficient for sampling such landscapes, or if a different method could provide equivalent data with less effort. Thus, a field and simulation-based study was carried out to compare the efficiency and accuracy of a variable area transect versus the fixed area square plot. Field efficiency tests were carried out in three habitat types, robusta coffee plantations, arabica coffee plantations and a privately owned forest fragment, in Kodagu, southern India. A simulation study of bias, precision and accuracy of the two methods for tree density estimation also was carried out using various spatial distribution patterns and densities. The variable area transect was significantly more efficient per unit effort in the field than the fixed area square plot. In the simulation tests both methods performed equally well under random spatial distribution. However, under simulated aggregated distribution both methods were positively biased (square plot up to 12% at low density, variable area transect 9\xe2\x80\x9312% at all densities), and under simulated regular distribution the variable area transect was slightly negatively biased (\xe2\x88\x925 to \xe2\x88\x927% at medium to high density). The variable area transect thus can be recommended over the square plot for rapid assessment of tree diversity and density, when the vegetation is expected to be randomly dispersed.'

Abstract: 'Qualitative reproductive traits of 84 plant species belonging to 41 families were studied in tropical dry evergreen forest on the Coromandel coast of India. Majority of species had rotate type, white-coloured, scented flowers, rewarding nectar and pollen and pollinated chiefly by bees. An association between floral traits and pollination spectrum is evident. Bee pollination was prevalent in pollination systems. Among the fruit types, drupe and berry were common in black and red colour respectively, and dispersed by zoochorous mode. Seeds of brown- and green-coloured dry fruits, without any reward were disseminated by wind and explosion. The reproductive phenophase of trees and lianas occurred mostly during the dry period from January to June, which receives rainfall of less than 50\xc2\xa0mm a month. However, shrubs showed a peak in flowering and fruiting in wet period. Detailed phenological observations of 22 woody species revealed a seasonal and unimodal pattern in flowering. Although some species were in flower round the year, flowering activity was skewed towards the dry season. The fruiting activity showed a bimodal pattern, one peak in dry season and another in wet season. Many species displayed a temporal aggregation in flowering and fruiting. The significant relation was obtained between reproductive traits and phenology of plants in the tropical dry evergreen forest.'

Abstract: 'Endophytic fungi are reported to produce diverse classes of secondary metabolites. This study investigated the antimicrobial and free radical scavenging activity of a foliar endophytic fungus from Nothapodytes foetida, a medium sized tree known to produce the antineoplastic compound camptothecin. The fungal isolate was identified as Bionectria ochroleuca based on the ITS rDNA analysis. The differences among endophytic, pathogenic and free living Bionectria ochroleuca were established by RNA secondary structure analysis. The metabolites showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial, antifungal and anti-dermatophytic activity. Minimum inhibitory concentration values of ethyl acetate extracts were in the range of 78\xe2\x80\x93625\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/mL against all test organisms, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5\xc2\xa0mg/mL). Antimicrobial components in the ethyl acetate extract were identified by GC-MS analysis. The isolate was also produced volatile antifungal compounds. A dose-dependent free radical quenching was observed in the ethyl acetate extract. This is the first report on Bionectria sp. as an endophyte of N. foetida. The results indicate that the B. ochroleuca NOTL33 isolate is a potential source of antimicrobial agents and could be used as an effective biofumigant.'

Abstract: 'A mounting body of critical research is raising the credibility of Traditional Knowledge (TK) in scientific studies. These studies have gained credibility because their claims are supported by methods that are repeatable and provide data for quantitative analyses that can be used to assess confidence in the results. The theoretical importance of our study is to test consensus (reliability/replicable) of TK within one ancient culture; the Irulas of the Kodiakkarai Reserve Forest (KRF), India. We calculated relative frequency (RF) and consensus factor (Fic) of TK from 120 Irulas informants knowledgeable of medicinal plants. Our research indicates a high consensus of the Irulas TK concerning medicinal plants. The Irulas revealed a diversity of plants that have medicinal and nutritional utility in their culture and specific ethnotaxa used to treat a variety of illnesses and promote general good health in their communities. Throughout history aboriginal people have been the custodians of bio-diversity and have sustained healthy life-styles in an environmentally sustainable manner. However this knowledge has not been transferred to modern society. We suggest this may be due to the asymmetry between scientific and TK, which demands a new approach that considers the assemblage of TK and scientific knowledge. A greater understanding of TK is beginning to emerge based on our research with both the Irulas and Malasars; they believe that a healthy lifestyle is founded on a healthy environment. These aboriginal groups chose to share this knowledge with society-at-large in order to promote a global lifestyle of health and environmental sustainability.'

Title: 'Three decades of wildlife radio telemetry in India: a review'

URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2050-3385-2-4
Abstract: 'From 1983, there have been three decades of the application and development of radio telemetry for wildlife studies in India. In this article, we review 82 studies from India, covering 47 species from four taxonomic classes. We examine and discuss the trends in the selection of study species, habitats and objectives of radio-telemetry studies and the functional success of radio collars and tags. A strong bias for study species and study region is observed and researchers generally tend not to look beyond the traditional research questions. Habitats that are difficult to access, such as the Trans-Himalayas, the Himalayas and north-eastern India, are overlooked. Most of the studies aimed to infer primary information only, such as home range, migration and movement patterns and habitat preference (53.7%, 47.6% and 28.1% studies, respectively). We expect these trends to change with time as the development of technology allows researchers to explore further. We investigated the tracking histories of 483 animals and the records of 496 radio collars or tags, but detailed information could be acquired for only 330 collars or tags. Of the collars, 49% malfunctioned before the end of their anticipated life due to a variety of reasons, early battery drainage being the prevalent cause. The performance of different technologies and collar manufacturers was also analysed but the small sample size was an issue for most of the cases. Argos-based collars and tags generally failed to record most of the locations precisely and failed to transmit them successfully. Issues with permissions and capturing animals for tagging, particular to India, are also discussed. A uniform and centralized system for granting permissions and guidelines for capturing and handling animals would be beneficial to future telemetry studies.'

Abstract: 'The understanding of the regional and local dimensions of vulnerability due to climate change is essential to develop appropriate and targeted adaptation efforts. We assessed the local dimensions of vulnerability in the tropical state of Kerala, India, using a purposely developed vulnerability index, which accounts for both environmental and socio-economic factors. The large extents of coastal wetlands and lagoons and high concentration of mangrove forests make the state environmentally vulnerable. Low human development index, large population of socially deprived groups, which are dependent on the primary sector, and high population density make the state vulnerable from a socio-economic point of view. The present study investigates climate change vulnerability at the district level in the State of Kerala relying on a purposely developed composite vulnerability index that encompasses both socio-economic and environmental factors. The Kerala coast contains the socio-economically and ecologically most vulnerable regions, as demonstrated by a composite vulnerability index.'

Abstract: 'A study was carried out to investigate the population structure and tree species diversity in two different forest types of Nagaland. A total of 40 and 48 quadrats were plotted randomly in subtropical semi evergreen (SSE) and tropical wet evergreen (TWE) forest, respectively; and trees having\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x8910\xc2\xa0cm girth at breast height were measured. Maximum 38 tree species belonging to 25 families in SEE and 30 species belonging to 24 families were recorded in TWE forest. Both the forest types were dominated by the tree species belonging to the Meliaceae family. A total of 613 individuals/ha with 1728.23\xc2\xa0m2 basal area were recorded in TWE forest as compared to the 512 individuals/ha with 2363.88\xc2\xa0m2 basal area in SSE forest. Shannon and Simpson diversity indices varied from 3.27\xe2\x80\x932.69 and 0.05\xe2\x80\x930.10, respectively. Moreover, 30\xe2\x80\x9360\xc2\xa0cm girth class showed higher number of individuals followed by 60\xe2\x80\x9390\xc2\xa0cm class. Tectona grandis, Gmelina arborea and Duabanga grandiflora were the dominant species in SSE, while TWE was dominated by Gmelina arborea and Grevillea robusta. The present study provides baseline data on population structure and diversity of trees in two forest types of Nagaland.'

Abstract: 'In a major deviation from conventional joint forest management approaches where the emphasis of management is on provision of forest products to the participating villagers, the Tamil Nadu Afforestation Project (TAP) focused on poverty alleviation as the principal means to achieve sustainable forest management. This study assesses the effectiveness of TAP\xe2\x80\x99s strategy in improving the ecology and socio-economic conditions of forest fringe villages using a diverse set of research methods. Results indicate that in a span of four to seven years, there was significant increase in forest cover, biodiversity, and agricultural productivity. The project villages have also shown considerable progress in various indicators of socio-economic development. The authors, however, suggest continued poverty alleviation and promotion of alternative livelihood opportunities to place the programme on a stable ground. Meeting the development needs of local villagers through strong and durable institutional linkages is also suggested for the programme to sustain and succeed.'

Title: 'Ultramafic geoecology of South and Southeast Asia'

Abstract: 'Globally, ultramafic outcrops are renowned for hosting floras with high levels of endemism, including plants with specialised adaptations such as nickel or manganese hyperaccumulation. Soils derived from ultramafic regoliths are generally nutrient-deficient, have major cation imbalances, and have concomitant high concentrations of potentially phytotoxic trace elements, especially nickel. The South and Southeast Asian region has the largest surface occurrences of ultramafic regoliths in the world, but the geoecology of these outcrops is still poorly studied despite severe conservation threats. Due to the paucity of systematic plant collections in many areas and the lack of georeferenced herbarium records and databased information, it is not possible to determine the distribution of species, levels of endemism, and the species most threatened. However, site-specific studies provide insights to the ultramafic geoecology of several locations in South and Southeast Asia. The geoecology of tropical ultramafic regions differs substantially from those in temperate regions in that the vegetation at lower elevations is generally tall forest with relatively low levels of endemism. On ultramafic mountaintops, where the combined forces of edaphic and climatic factors intersect, obligate ultramafic species and hyperendemics often occur. Forest clearing, agricultural development, mining, and climate change-related stressors have contributed to rapid and unprecedented loss of ultramafic-associated habitats in the region. The geoecology of the large ultramafic outcrops of Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s Sulawesi, Obi and Halmahera, and many other smaller outcrops in South and Southeast Asia, remains largely unexplored, and should be prioritised for study and conservation.'

Abstract: 'The Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) LISS III satellite imagery was used to classify three landscapes in the upper Satluj river watershed in Kinnaur region of western Himalaya viz. Nichar, Kalpa and Pooh. These landscapes representing different eco-climatic zones were subjected to landscape ecological analysis and various landscape composition, patch and edge characteristic metrics were computed to find the extent of fragmentation in the natural vegetation. The natural vegetation comprised of forests (10.24%), grasslands (31.04%) and scrublands (2.95%) as the landscape elements (LSE). These LSEs were further segregated into different LSE types based on the dominant species of plant communities in the landscapes. These LSE types were surveyed for species diversity in the three landscapes. The total landscape area (TLA) covered by natural vegetation in Nichar, Kalpa and Pooh landscapes was calculated to be 651.42, 529.02 and 1,673.72\xc2\xa0km2 making the total area covered with natural vegetation in the district as 2,854.16\xc2\xa0km2. The Pooh block, lying in the east of the district, though covered the largest area of the landscape, was poor in terms of landscape composition as compared to the Nichar block which was rich in landscape elements as suggested by the diversity measures. The extent of fragmentation was found to be highest in Nichar. The Nichar landscape was observed to be having higher mean values of species diversity than other blocks which is consistent with the trends observed with patches diversity. This was in contrast to the Pooh landscape where the patch diversity as well as the species diversity was the lowest. Thus, an ecological analysis utilizing landscape metrics and biodiversity field sampling of vegetation, was attempted for such heterogenous landscapes in high altitudes of Himalaya, which provided a baseline data for the management and conservation of these virgin mountainous areas.'

Abstract: 'Tropical regions are experiencing unprecedented economic and population growth. This goes hand in hand with increase habitat fragmentation of tropical ecosystems. Understanding the genetic consequences of these spatial and temporal changes across landscapes is critical to conservation of the vast majority of global biodiversity. This virtual issue of Conservation Genetics, presents six empirical and one review paper showcasing fascinating and important findings with regard to how habitat fragmentation impacts on genetic diversity in rare or endangered tropical species. The message from these papers is clear, fragmentation has a number of serious genetic consequences, which can contribute to undermining the viability of species in fragmented landscapes. Conservation genetics provides a powerful tool to inform both conservation and management of species and genetic resources. But, careful consideration is needed to ensure studies apply appropriate sampling designs and genetic analysis to better test hypothesis. Next generation genomics offers great opportunities to provide even more answers and greater resolution of the consequences for adaptive genetic variation, to ensure future tropical landscapes are resilient.'

Abstract: 'NORMAN MYERS: An honorary visiting fellow at Green College. He is an independent scientist and consultant working in environment and development.Like most other environmental and economic sectors, forestry worldwide looks set to encounter a growing number of surprises in the sense of major divergencies from established trends. These surprises will be largely environmental or economic or both at once. Unless we do a better job of identifying them ahead of time, these surprises will often be of a scale to overwhelm our anticipatory and preventive capacities. Indeed and as this paper demonstrates, the most likely as well as the most taxing forestry problems of the future will often be the ones we have scarcely thought of. Fortunately, the same applies to forestry opportunities. In these circumstances, there is a premium on not only supplying answers to recognized questions but on raising entirely new questions.'

Abstract: 'For sustainable development in a river basin, it is crucial to understand population growth\xe2\x80\x93land use/land cover (LU/LC) transformations\xe2\x80\x93water quality nexus. This study investigates the effects of demographic changes and LU/LC transformations on surface water quality of rural (Ghod) and urban (Mula-Mutha) subbasins of Upper Bhima River basin. Population data (1981\xe2\x80\x932011) and LU/LC data {October 2002 [Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data] and October/November 2009 (Indian Remote Sensing 1C Linear Imaging Self Scanner III data]} were analysed using statistical, remote sensing and geographic information system techniques to study demographic and LU/LC changes, respectively. Further, overall indices of pollution (OIPs) developed specifically for rural subbasin (OIPr: Hardness CaCO3 and Total Dissolved Solids), urban subbasin (OIPu: Biological Oxygen Demand, Chlorides, Coliform Total, Colour, Dissolved Oxygen%, pH and Turbidity) and single OIP considering all parameters (OIPa) were used for spatio-temporal water quality assessment of pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods. Results revealed that from 1981 to 2011, population increase was higher in urban subbasin than in rural subbasin. Subsequently, from 2002 to 2009 mainly increase in built-up lands (3.82%) and agricultural lands (15.35%) in urban and rural subbasins respectively, affected their water quality. From 2002 to 2009, the highest increase in OIPr and OIPu was observed at Kashti (3.37\xe2\x80\x936.52 due to fertilizers) and Bundgarden Bridge (3.03\xe2\x80\x937.83 due to municipal and industrial wastes) stations of rural and urban subbasins, respectively. With significant increase in OIPa of 2.74\xe2\x80\x936.70, Bundgarden Bridge station affected by urbanization had the most polluted water quality.'

Abstract: 'Sustainable food production is one of the major challenges of the twenty-first century in the era of global environmental problems such as climate change, increasing population and natural resource degradation including soil degradation and biodiversity loss. Climate change is among the greatest threats to agricultural systems. Green Revolution though multiplied agricultural production several folds but at the huge environmental cost including climate change. It jeopardized the ecological integrity of agroecosystems by intensive use of fossil fuels, natural resources, agrochemicals and machinery. Moreover, it threatened the age-old traditional agricultural practices. Agriculture is one of the largest sectors that sustain livelihood to maximum number of people and contribute to climate change. Therefore, a climate-smart approach to sustainable food production is the need of hour. Traditional agriculture is getting increased attention worldwide in context of sustainable food production in changing climate. The present article advocates traditional agriculture as a climate-smart approach for the sustainable food production and also deliberates the correlation between climate change and agriculture.'

Abstract: 'Patches and their boundaries are sensitive to the scale at which they are viewed. The response of species to patchiness may depend on the resolution and on the extent by which the spatial pattern is perceived. The goal of this paper is to identify the scale at which forest spatial pattern causes changes in species richness and abundances of Dipteran and Homopteran species as a whole, and further on their distinctive ecological functional groups. Using remotely-sensed optical imagery, we described the landscape structure surrounding sampling sites. We used two approaches to deal with the problem of the scale of observation: 1) variation of extent using a multiscale analysis, and 2) comparison of two satellite sensors with different spatial resolutions (SPOT: 20 \xc3\x97 20 m, and Landsat TM: 30 \xc3\x97 30 m). The relationship between entomological data and landscape descriptors at different spatial scales was tested with the Mantel test, redundancy analysis and stepwise multiple linear regression. Relative abundances of Homopteran species were affected by landscape patterns at finer scales than in Diptera. The strength of response to landscape was different for each Dipteran functional group. The multiscale analysis also enabled the optimal scale (6.25 ha) of landscape pattern, accounting for 62% of the variation in Homopteran richness, to be identified. As a practical application, Homopteran richness was mapped by extrapolation of the regression function to the pixels of the image. Multiscale analysis provides an alternative view of fragmentation effects, which are traditionally studied through the patch-based approach, and highlights the importance of scale in ecological processes. The detection of optimal scales and the use of satellite images enable maps of important biotic indicators to be drawn up.'

Abstract: 'Long before the applications of Science and Technology for conservation of biodiversity and sustainable development became a recognized field of human endeavour, there have been attempts by individuals and institutions who had the commitment and wisdom to begin the effort. The authors have chosen historical incidents tracing the rudiments of the work of Emperor Ashoka, to the Bishnois of Rajasthan, John Muir, a Scottish-born American in USA, Richard St. Barbe Baker and Wangari Maathai in Africa. People such as Chico Mendes lost their life in preventing the destruction of great Amazonian forest and N. I. Vavilov, a Russian geneticist who foresaw the value of collecting large samples of seeds of cultivated plants in seed banks, much against the then prevalent communist doctrine, not believing in the importance of inheritance. The Chipko movement in Garhwal Himalaya started by Gaura devi and other womenfolk supported by Chandi Prasad Bhat and Sunderlal Bahuguna has been briefly traced. References are also made to the work of Jim Corbett and Salim Ali for the conservation of tigers and birds respectively and recounting the enormous movement to save Silent Valley representing tropical evergreen forest in Kerala from being utilized for generating a very small amount of power. The decision taken by Government of India to refuse Vedanta Resources from utilizing the Niyamgiri Hills in Orissa for bauxite mining which is considered as an abode of their Niyamraja, worshipped by the Dongaria Kondh tribe consisting of 8,000 people has been hailed by the Indian people as just. Finally attention is drawn to Prof. A. Abraham\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to develop a Tropical Botanical Garden and Research Institute in Kerala for collection, conservation and sustainable utilization of 800 medicinal plants, orchids, bamboos and other useful tropical plants. A brief note on the intense efforts made by K. S. Manilal in bringing out English and Malayalam Editions of Hortus Malabaricus compiled by Van Rheede in 12 volumes in old Latin between 1678 and 1693 and in publishing the Flora of Silent Valley has been included.'

Abstract: 'Large connected landscapes are paramount to maintain top predator populations. Across their range, tiger (Panthera tigris) populations occur in small fragmented patches of habitat, often isolated by large distances in human-dominated landscapes. We assessed connectivity between 16 protected areas (PAs) in central India, a global priority landscape for tiger conservation, using data on land use and land cover, human population density, and transportation infrastructure. We identified and prioritized movement routes using a combination of least-cost corridor modeling and circuit theory. Our analyses suggest that there are several opportunities to maintain connectivity in this landscape. We mapped a total of thirty-five linkages in the region and calculated metrics to estimate their quality and importance. The highest quality linkages as measured by the ratio of cost-weighted distance to Euclidean distance are Kanha\xe2\x80\x93Phen/Bandhavgarh\xe2\x80\x93SanjayGhasidas/Melghat\xe2\x80\x93Satpura, and cost-weighted distance to least-cost path length are Nawegaon\xe2\x80\x93Tadoba/Achanakmar\xe2\x80\x93SanjayGhasidas/Kanha\xe2\x80\x93Phen. We used current flow centrality to evaluate the contribution of each PA and linkage toward facilitating animal movement. Values are highest for Kanha and Pench tiger reserves, and the linkages between Kanha\xe2\x80\x93Phen, Kanha\xe2\x80\x93Pench, and Pench\xe2\x80\x93Satpura, suggesting that these PAs and linkages play a critical role in maintaining connectivity in central India. In addition, smaller areas such as Bor, Nawegaon, and Phen have high centrality scores relative to their areas and thus may act as important stepping stones. We mapped pinch points, which are sections of the linkages where tiger movement is restricted due to unfavorable habitat, transportation networks, human habitation, or a combination of factors. Currently, very limited data exist on tiger movement outside of PAs to validate model results. Regional-scale connectivity mapping efforts can assist managers and policy makers to develop strategic plans for balancing wildlife conservation and other land uses in the landscape.'

Abstract: 'The plant resources form an integral part of a huge inter-dependent system that encompasses the physical components and the biological community of life. These resources have enormous prospective benefits to humankind. The ever-increasing population and climate change over the years have contributed substantially to the pressure on plant resources leading to their decline or loss in nature. Hence, there is an immediate need to develop suitable conservation strategies for proper utilization and sustainability of these important resources.'

Abstract: 'The conservation of Himalayan forests is big concern in view of global agenda. Many studies in this endeavor reported that the rate of forests degradation is posing a severe threat to the landscape and existing biodiversity in the Himalayas. Currently there many conservation approaches exists and of them four are widely recognized (1) Conservation through traditional religious beliefs \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional conserved forests\xe2\x80\x9d (TCF); (2) Conservation through governmental planning and schemes \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment conserved forests\xe2\x80\x9d (GCF); (3) Conservation through creation of protected areas (PAF); and (4) Conservation through community efforts \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity conserved forests\xe2\x80\x9d (CCF). Our hypothesis in this direction says that all the conservation approaches lead to same results concerning to forest conservation. To testify our hypothesis we have studied the forests of each conservation regimes and evaluated them based on the identified indicators. We have done empirical studies and following the cloud-free satellite data were used for last three decades (such as Multi-Spectral Scanner, Linear Imaging and Self Scanning, and Enhanced Thematic Mapper ) to study a change in vegetation dynamics of the mountain forests in multi-temporal dimension. Our research concluded that community conservation approach have greater significance for biodiversity conservation and management in the Himalayan region. Here we support the model of CCF for forest ecosystem conservation, alongside the sustainable livelihood of the mountain societies. But every conservation regimes has its own importance in viewpoint of the particular objectives. Therefore, we suggests advancement and revision of PAF and GCF however, some elements of CCF can be introduced in TCF for making up it more sound in view of rapid socio-economic and cultural changes taking place in the communities.'

Abstract: 'Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) is the largest and the most diverse mountain region in the world that provides ecosystem services to one fifth of the total world population. The forests are fragmented to different degrees due to expansion and intensification of human land use. However, the quantitative relationship between fragmentation and demography has not been established before for HKH vis-\xc3\xa0-vis along elevation gradient. We used the globally available tree canopy cover data derived from Landsat-TM satellite to find out the decadal forest cover change over 2000 to 2010 and their corresponding fragmentation levels. Using SRTM-derived DEM, we observed high forest cover loss up to 2400 m that highly corroborated with the population distribution pattern as derived from satellite observation. In general, forest cover loss was found to be higher in south-eastern part of HKH. Forest fragmentation obtained using \xe2\x80\x98area-weighted mean radius of gyration\xe2\x80\x99 as indicator, was found to be very high up to 2400 m that also corroborated with high human population for the year 2000 and 2010. We observed logarithmic decrease in fragmentation change (area-weighted mean radius of gyration value), forest cover loss and population growth during 2000-2010 along the elevation gradient with very high R2 values (i.e., 0.889, 0.895, 0.944 respectively). Our finding on the pattern of forest fragmentation and human population across the elevation gradient in HKH region will have policy level implication for different nations and would help in characterizing hotspots of change. Availability of free satellite derived data products on forest cover and DEM, grid-data on demography, and utility of geospatial tools helped in quick evaluation of the forest fragmentation vis-a-vis human impact pattern along the elevation gradient in HKH.'

Abstract: 'Feelings and experiences of the author over Classical Taxonomy in India during the last 4 decades is discussed. Brief history and outline of development of the subject is provided. The systematic exploratory phase of taxonomy is said to have started around the middle of 16th century and with two major events, the subject reached its peak. The first one being the development of the concept of Herbarium and second one being the introduction of the Binomial System of Nomenclature by Linnaeus in 1753. Both the events laid the firm foundation for Classical Taxonomy. But during the last few decades with the development of Bio-systematic phase, although revolutionary changes in concepts of taxonomy could be noticed, the Classical Taxonomy got completely side tracked. Discussing the current status of Taxonomy in the country, the author emphasizes the dwindling nature of the subject. Among many other causes, development of more fashionable and experimental areas of modern biology, faulty methods of teaching by untrained taxonomists in most Universities, lack of sufficient taxonomic literature and herbaria, synthetic nature of discipline of taxonomy, lack of sufficient number of practicing taxonomists and field botanists to carry out the survey and documentation of the vast diversity of the flora of India, most taxonomic journals with least or no impact factor, low citation index of Classical Taxonomists, development of computer databases and computer identification devices by non-taxonomists, molecular biologists side tracking the Classical Taxonomists in areas of biodiversity assessments, avoidance of taxonomists by modern biologists in programmes of Bioprospection, apathy towards the subject by fund giving bodies and lastly, least recognitions of Classical Taxonomists by scientific bodies are cited as prominent reasons for the decline of the subject. Although Botanical Survey of India has done a commendable job in accomplishing the tasks of Taxonomists, some how the organization has failed in generating and enthusing the required number of younger taxonomists and group specialists in the country. Worse is the case with many Universities who have, to some extent killed the subject. All these factors have collectively brought about a serious decline in the subject resulting in the acute shortage of younger generation of field botanists and taxonomists who are to shoulder the big responsibilities of inventorizing the rich biodiversity in the tropics. However, the situation is not that hopeless. The achievements of Classical Taxonomists during the last 4 decades in inventorization and documentation of the flora of the country is commendable. Today the dimensions and scope of the subject have widened beyond imagination. Floristic taxonomists are sought after by many for taking part in applied aspects such as bio-prospection, new drug discoveries, search for alternate economic plant resources, conservation of biological resources and monitoring of fragile ecosystems. The author strongly feels that taxonomy with the additional objectives and broadened scope will certainly regain its past glory and become one of the challenging disciplines of biology in the 21st century.'

Abstract: 'Global scale drivers such as international markets for shrimp can trigger large changes at local and regional scales. But there is also a poorly appreciated reverse process, operating from the bottom up, with potential for triggering changes at higher scales. Thus, effects of drivers can be seen as a two-way process in which global drivers and local and regional drivers can potentially impact each other. Here, we argue that not only can global drivers impact the sustainability of local and regional social-ecological systems, but sustainability at higher scales can also be impacted by changes at the scale of local and regional social-ecological systems. Using Chilika, a large lagoon on the Bay of Bengal, Odisha State in India as a case, we show that traditional small-scale capture fisheries supporting 150 fisher villages with some 400,000 people were marginalized by aquaculture development for tiger prawn and by state-driven hydrological interventions, with impacts on the ecology of the lagoon. These changes, in turn, contribute to global poverty and food insecurity, making it difficult for India to meet international targets such as millennium development goals. The marginalized fisherfolk become part of environmental justice and other social movements. With large parts of the lagoon converted into a virtual monoculture for the production of tiger prawn, changes in Chilika (a Ramsar site) contribute to wetland habitat loss at the global scale, and biodiversity losses, possibly including IUCN red-listed species.'

Abstract: 'Alborz Mountains host Caspian Hyrcanian forest ecoregion along the northern slopes and forest steppe ecoregion in highlands. Hyrcanian forest covers the southeastern part of Caucasus biodiversity hotspot and is of great biogeographic importance. Altitudinal pattern and correlation between woody species biodiversity (DIV), forest structure ((stem density (DEN), mean basal area (MBA) and mean height class (MHC)) and disturbance (DIS) were explored along 2,400 m altitudinal gradient in Hyrcanian relict forest, Central Alborz Mountains. Vegetation changes from lowland forest (LoF) to midaltitude forest (MiF) and montane forest (MoF) in this area. The altitudinal gradient was divided into twelve 200 m elevational belts. Point centered quarter method (PCQM) with 96 sampling points and 83 vegetation samples by plot method (PM) were used to record field data. Shannon-Wiener index and Pearson coefficient were used for diversity and correlation analysis. The results showed that DEN decreased linearly, MBA and MHC showed relatively hump shaped and DIS showed a reverse hump shaped pattern of change along altitudinal gradient. Woody species diversity decreased non-steadily from LoF to MoF. Transitional vegetations of Carpinus-Fagus and Fagus-Quercus represented higher diversity of woody taxa compared to adjacent homogenous communities. Significant correlation was observed between altitude and all parameters: DEN with MBA, DIS and DIV; MBA with DIS; MHC with DIS along with DIV; and DIS with DIV at the study area scale. Surprisingly, correlation between studied parameters differed within each vegetation type. Altitude probably acts as a proxy for human and environmental driving forces in this area. Stability of warm and wet condition, season length, soil depth along with forest accessibility probably influences the altitudinal pattern of the studied parameters. Disturbance affects forest structure and consequently diversity; especially in lowlands. The obtained results recommend using both forest biodiversity and mensuration data in management process of forest ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Coastal resources viz., coral reefs, seagrasses, mangroves, and coastal land features viz., sandy beach, mudflats and salt pan/aquaculture ponds were classified and assessed in the Palk Bay region of the south-east coast of India using IRS LISS III satellite image (1996, 2000, 2002 and 2004). The study recorded an areal coverage of 286.95 ha of reef area during 2004, which is 177.54 ha lesser than that of the reef area of 1996. The reef vegetation composed mainly of seaweeds has gained over 29.44 ha during the same period. Likewise, sand over reef area has also increased alarmingly i.e. 120.34 ha between 1996 and 2004. The seagrass beds of Munaikkadu region of the Palk Bay are comparatively protected and have gained over 7.5 ha between 1996 and 2004. It has been found that both the dense (2.99 ha) and sparse (36.45 ha) mangroves have gained their areal coverage considerably between 1996 and 2004. Whereas in Devipattinam region, many anthropogenic pressures are exerted only on the seagrass resources which has led to the reduction of over 785.5 ha of dense seagrass beds between 1996 and 2004. The study clearly indicated that the resources are under the pressures of low to high threats, especially the coral reefs and seagrasses, if the pressures continue, coastal resources of the Palk Bay may face serious threats of destruction in this part of the Bay in the years to come.'

Abstract: 'In biodiversity-rich areas, both conservation and socioeconomic development are at the core of discussions among various stakeholders, such as local people, policymakers, conservationists, resource management professionals, economists, researchers/scientists, and so forth. Various innovations are being provided that aim at promoting both improved livelihood for the people and the conservation and management of natural resources in the Central Himalaya of India. Many studies point out the factors responsible for the tremendous decline of natural resources and also how they have affected the local people\xe2\x80\x99s livelihood options. In this context, the current study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of various solutions/innovations that are being implemented in the Himalayas of India. Unfortunately, only a few are found to be successful in both conservation and sustainable livelihood development. This study reveals that people are still looking for more viable solutions that could help them improve their lifestyle, as well as facilitating ecosystem conservation and supporting existing biodiversity. Based on the present study, it is argued that an in-depth empirical study of any region is a necessary process prior to offering solutions to achieve the desired goals, as considered by development agencies and policy-planners.'

Abstract: 'Macrofungi play an extraordinarily important role in the catalysis of the nutrient cycle of deciduous and coniferous forests. Habitat degradation adversely influences the number of fruiting bodies of macrofungi and diminishes the diversity of the fungal community. The diversity of the terricolous- and lignicolous macrofungi assemblages were compared in stands of semi-natural and two plant associations modified by humans in different degrees in North-East Hungary. We used data from 15 permanent plots that were sampled for vascular plants and macrofungi. Rank-abundance curves and R\xc3\xa9nyi\xe2\x80\x99s diversity profiles were applied for diversity research. The results indicated that structure and diversity of the terricolous macrofungi assemblages were mainly influenced by climatic and habitat conditions and the degradation of the plant associations to a lesser degree. The diversity of lignicolous macrofungi was primarily affected by the continuous presence, quality, and quantity of deadwood. Accordingly, the form and degree of forest management, as well as the age of the growing stocks, influenced community structure. If nature conservation planning and conservation activity are based on those biodiversity indicators which are good proxies for macrofungi biodiversity, the latter might be optimal for preserving macrofungi biodiversity.'

The change of relative abundance for the moisture-sensitive tree species, such as Quercus mongolica and Larix olgensis, was helpful to detect climate change. Use of GIS software and the \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2w indices of tree diversity on NECT showed that the areas of high and medium tree diversity decreased, respectively, while the area of low tree diversity increased. The heterogeneity of habitats along the NECT increased with climate change and local human activities.'

Abstract: 'Conservation efforts globally are skewed toward terrestrial ecosystems. To date, conservation of aquatic ecosystems, in particular fish fauna, is largely neglected. We provide a country-wide assessment of Indian river ecosystems in order to identify and prioritize areas for protection and restoration of freshwater fish fauna. Using various biodiversity and anthropogenic attributes, coupled with tools of ecological modeling, we delineated areas for fish fauna conservation and restoration in the 20 major river basins of India. To do this, we used prioritization analyses and reserve selection algorithms to derive conservation value index (CVI) and vulnerability index (VI) of the river basins. CVI was estimated using endemicity, rarity, conservation value, and taxonomic singularity, while VI was estimated using a disturbance index derived from percent geographic area of the basin under human settlements, human population density, predominant land use, and total number of exotic fish species in each basin. The two indices, CVI and VI, were converted into geo-referenced maps, and each map was super-imposed onto species richness and forest cover maps, respectively. After superimposition, areas with high CVI and low VI shade intensities were delineated for conservation, while areas with high CVI and high VI shade intensities were demarcated for restoration. In view of the importance of freshwater fish for human livelihoods and consumption, and ecosystems of India\xe2\x80\x99s rivers, we call for urgent attention to the conservation of their fish fauna along with restoration of their degraded habitats.'

Abstract: 'Ecotourism is increasingly being promoted as an instrument that helps local socio-economic development and generate revenues to strengthen conservation of critically endangered biodiversity. It is often posited the magic bullet particularly across protected areas in the Global South. In theory, ecotourism can provide economic benefits to economically weaker communities living around protected areas and inspire them to protect the biodiversity in their own interest. This paper, however, provides empirical evidence that the so-called win\xe2\x80\x93win is not an unqualified truism. With a case study on Sundarban Biosphere Reserve, world\xe2\x80\x99s largest mangrove biodiversity and home of highly endangered Royal Bengal Tiger, this article examines complexities involved in ecotourism and urges the need to make it context-specific. It assesses ecotourism\xe2\x80\x99s ability to provide livelihood alternatives to local communities and how can it help in conservation. The findings demonstrate an unequal, uneven, and skewed accumulation of benefits of ecotourism, often associated with market mechanisms of global environmental protection. As little as 36% of the interviewees claimed receiving direct or indirect benefits from ecotourism, the study finds. It failed to offer any benefits at all to the poorest and most marginal communities. On the contrary, it offered disproportionately larger returns to the remotely located capital invested in the local ecotourism facilities in the Sundarbans, thus defeating the principle behind the mechanism. In the area of conservation, tourism was blamed for increasing pollution and harming the health of the ecosystem by tourists who were considered \xe2\x80\x98outsiders\xe2\x80\x99 and insensitive to the ecology by the locals and conservation agencies alike.'

Abstract: 'Vegetation health of any ecosystem and changes in it are vital in global change in ecology and it is delicately linked to climate change. This study evaluated the spatial patterns of significant negative change trend using composite NOAA-AVHRR data time series (1982\xe2\x80\x932006), long term forest fire point data, invasive hotspot data and predicted climate anomalies data over the different harmonized landcover categories of India. Around 65% of Indian forest shows the trend of negative change. Significant negative change were found to be highest (203,026\xc2\xa0km2) over \xe2\x80\x98Tropical mixed deciduous and dry deciduous forests\xe2\x80\x99 category, followed by \xe2\x80\x98Tropical lowland forests, broadleaved, evergreen\xe2\x80\x99 (81,555\xc2\xa0km2) and \xe2\x80\x98Evergreen shrubland & regrowth/Abandoned shifting cultivation/Extensive shifting cultivation\xe2\x80\x99 (55,811\xc2\xa0km2). Around 85% of Indian biodiversity hotspot showed the negative change. The analysis of forest fire revealed the \xe2\x80\x98Tropical mixed deciduous and dry deciduous forests\xe2\x80\x99 retained the highest forest fire percentage (40%). The prediction of temperature anomalies for the year 2030 using RCP 4.5 model showed the increase in the temperature in the range of 0.58\xe2\x80\x931.32\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C and was found highest in northern part of India. Similarly, the rainfall prediction for the year 2030 showed rainfall deficit in several states of India. The outcomes of the present study would help in prioritization of various vegetation types suffering from anthropogenic and natural disturbances and will guide the policymakers to safeguard, prioritized forest areas for effective conservation, scientific protection and climate change mitigation endeavors.'

Abstract: 'Forest fragmentation is one of the most important threats to global biodiversity, particularly in tropical developing countries. Identifying priority areas for conservation within these forests is essential to their effective management. However, this requires current, accurate environmental information that is often lacking in developing countries. The Cockpit Country, Jamaica, contains forests of international importance in terms of levels of endemism and overall diversity. These forests are under severe threat from the prospect of bauxite mining and other anthropogenic disturbances. In the absence of adequate, up-to-date ecological information, we used satellite remote sensing data and fragmentation analysis to identify interior forested areas that have experienced little or no change as priority conservation sites. We classified Landsat images from 1985, 1989, 1995, 2002, and 2008, using an object-oriented method, which allowed for the inclusion of roads. We conducted our fragmentation analysis using metrics to quantify changes in forest patch number, area, shape, and aggregation. Deforestation and fragmentation fluctuated within the 23-year period but were mostly confined to the periphery of the forest, close to roads and access trails. An area of core forest that remained intact over the period of study was identified within the largest forest patch, most of which was located within the boundaries of a forest reserve and included the last remaining patches of closed-broadleaf forest. These areas should be given highest priority for conservation, as they constitute important refuges for endemic or threatened biodiversity. Minimizing and controlling access will be important in maintaining this core.'

Abstract: 'This study examines the spatial and temporal forest cover changes in Swat and Shangla districts to understand the deforestation pattern in context of the recent security conflict in these districts. We used multi-resolution satellite images to assess the long term deforestation from 2001 to2009 and also to identify episodic forest cutting areas appeared during the conflict period of Oct. 2007\xe2\x80\x93Oct. 2008. There are only 58 ha of deforestation identified during the conflict period while 1268 ha of gross annual deforestation were assessed during last eight years. Most of the deforestation patches persist around the administrative boundaries at sub-district levels (tehsils) which can be attributed to ambiguity in unclear jurisdiction between the forest official. The results highlight that the forest cutting appeared in Swat and Shangla during the conflict period is not as significant when compared with the long term deforestation pattern in the area. On the one side the results of the study are supportive to the picture that emerges from international studies which report high rate of deforestation in the country and on the other side it negates any relation between the security situation and the increasing deforestation in the north western Pakistan. The study concludes that deforestation assessments require verification by independent sources of data, such as satellite imagery to improve our understanding of deforestation processes.'

Abstract: 'The present study is focussed on development of a high-frequency micro-multiplication system in Calamus thwaitesii, through somatic embryogenesis from immature zygotic embryos cultured in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 31.68\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The semi-friable calli when cultured in the same medium augmented with 2.22\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 1.07\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M \xce\xb1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) induced\xc2\xa0~\xc2\xa012 discrete globular embryoids in 6\xc2\xa0weeks. The isolated embryoids in hormone-free media yielded 65% plantlets. Furthermore, embryoids and axenic shoots exhibited maximum shoot induction in medium supplemented with 0.45\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M Thidiazuron (TDZ). The shoot initials after subculture in media supplemented with 1.78\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M BAP and 0.45\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M TDZ produced shoot proliferation followed by elongation in basal medium. The elongated shoots produced roots in media supplemented with 16.11\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M NAA. With this established protocol,\xc2\xa0~\xc2\xa05940 rooted plantlets could be harvested after 40\xc2\xa0weeks from a single embryoid. Genetic stability analysis of the plantlets using inter simple sequence repeat markers recorded only 0.05% genetic polymorphism. The plantlets were hardened in a mist house for 8\xc2\xa0weeks, and then to 50% shade house for another 16\xc2\xa0weeks, and the well-established 6-month-old nursery plants, reintroduced to selected forest segments, exhibited 86% field establishment even after 3\xc2\xa0years of observation. Thus, the mass multiplication system developed could be a breakthrough for large-scale multiplication of C. thwaitesii to ensure continuous supply of quality planting material to the cottage industry through the development of agroforestry systems. Furthermore, the in vitro culture system developed here can be replicated for research activities related to the long-term\xe2\x80\x93short-term conservation, micro-multiplication and sustainable utilization of rare, endangered, endemic, monopodial/single stemmed rattan palms.'

Abstract: 'Eleven accessions of an under-utilized legume, Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC. var. utilis (Wall. ex Wight) Baker ex Burck (velvet bean) were collected from four districts of South India and their agronomic characters were evaluated. The vegetative growth characters such as the germination percentage, plant height, number of leaves and branches per plant were recorded. The yield based characters such as the number of clusters/plant (4\xe2\x80\x9314), number of flowers/cluster (3\xe2\x80\x9315) and the fertility index (66\xe2\x80\x9391%) were observed. The seed yield reaches 2.9\xe2\x80\x936.9\xc2\xa0t/ha. The number of seeds per pod, seed weight and the seed recovery percentage were also calculated. The level of diversity in the agrobotanical traits of velvet bean observed in the present study could be of interest in a breeding programme.'

Abstract: 'Malaria control is compromised worldwide by continuously evolving drug-resistant strains of the parasite demanding exploration of natural resources for developing newer antimalarials. The northeastern region of India is endemic for malaria characterized by high prevalence of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains. Many plants are used by the indigenous communities living in the northeast India in their traditional system of medicine for the treatment of malarial fever. Folklore claim of antimalarial property of one such plant Brucea mollis was evaluated in vitro and in vivo for antiplasmodial activity. Crude extracts from dried B. mollis root powder were prepared through soxhlet extraction using petroleum ether, methanol, and water sequentially. Methanol extract was further partitioned between chloroform and water. These extracts were tested in vitro against laboratory-adapted chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum. In in vitro evaluation, extracts were found more active on the chloroquine-sensitive strain. Methanolic-chloroform (IC50 5.1\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xe2\x80\x89ml\xe2\x88\x921) and methanolic-aqueous (IC50 13.9\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xe2\x80\x89ml\xe2\x88\x921) extracts recorded significant in vitro antiplasmodial activity which was also supported by their promising in vivo activity (ED50 72 and 30\xc2\xa0mg\xe2\x80\x89kg\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\x89bw\xe2\x80\x89day\xe2\x88\x921, respectively) against chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium yoelli N-67 strain in Swiss albino mice. Methanolic-aqueous extract-treated mice survived on average for 14\xc2\xa0days that was comparable to the reference drug chloroquine. This is the first report of antiplasmodial activity of B. mollis validating the traditional use of this plant as antimalarial in the northeast India and calls for further detailed investigations.'

Abstract: 'We examined the response of forest tree species with different dispersal modes to anthropogenic pressure in a dry deciduous forest of South India. The species and their populations were sampled in two forest stands, one in proximity to a Soliga settlement (greater disturbance) and the other distant to the settlement (lower disturbance). Our results suggest that the populations of animal dispersed species than those of wind or passively dispersed species are more vulnerable to human disturbance. In fact wind dispersed species seem to be facilitated by human disturbances. The proximal site had a higher representation of understory plants and seedling belonging to wind dispersed species than that of animal dispersed species. We discuss the results in the context of the role of dispersal mode in shaping species response, and vegetation composition of forest to anthropogenic pressures.'

Title: 'Intra-specific differentiation of fungal endosymbiont Alternaria longissima CLB44 using RNA secondary structure analysis and their anti-infective potential'

Abstract: 'New antimicrobial agents derived from endosymbio-tic fungi with unique and targeted mode of action are crucially rudimentary to combat multidrug-resistant infections. Most of the fungi isolated as endosymbionts show close morphological feature resemblance to plant pathogenic or free-living forms, and it is difficult to differentiate these different lifestyles. A fungal endosymbiont strain CLB44 was isolated from Combretum latifolium Blume (Combretaceae). CLB44 was then identified as Alternaria longissima based on morphological and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) intervening 5.8S rRNA gene sequence analysis. ITS2 RNA secondary structure analysis was carried out using mfold server with temperature 37\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C, and anti-infective potential was determined by MIC and disk diffusion methods. ITS2 RNA secondary structure analysis clearly distinguished endosymbiotic A. longissima CLB44 from free-living and pathogenic A. longissima members in the same monophyletic clade. Secondary metabolites produced effectively inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml), Escherichia coli (25 \xce\xbcg/ml), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (50\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml), Candida albicans (100\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml), and other human pathogens. This study emerges as an innovative finding that explores newly revealed ITS2 RNAs that may be an insight as new markers for refining phylogenetic relations and to distinguish fungal endosymbionts with other free-living or pathogenic forms. A. longissima CLB44, in the emerging field of endosymbionts, will pave the way to a novel avenue in drug discovery to combat multidrug-resistant infections. The sequence data of this fungus is deposited in GenBank under the accession no. KU310611.'

Abstract: ' Knema andamanica is a red-listed endemic medicinal species of Myristicaceae restricted to Andaman and Nicobar (A&N) Islands, India. This species is used in tribal medicines and has immense bioprospective potential. With a view to generate suitable genomic markers for classification and identification, we have generated RAPD, SCAR and conserved 18S rDNA markers from K. andamanica. A unique 585\xc2\xa0bp fragment, that distinguished it from seven other related species of Myristicaceae was first amplified using the random primer OPE 06 and converted to SCAR marker (GenBank accession # JN228256). The conserved sequences of 18S rDNA loci from K. andamanica were also amplified and sequenced (GenBank accession #JN228265). The sequence revealed deviations including 18 variable regions and 15 indels that were unique to K. andamanica. These markers can help in definite identification of K. andamanica even at the juvenile stages.'

Abstract: 'Climate change is one of the most important global environmental challenges, which affects the entire earth system in terms of negative impacts on food production, water supply, health, livelihood, energy, etc. The intent of the present study was to assess the impact of climate change on the water balance components of a data-starved Upper Baitarani River basin of Eastern India using ArcSWAT model. The ArcSWAT model was calibrated using SUFI-2 technique. The daily observed streamflow data from 1998 to 2003 were employed for calibration and those for 2004\xe2\x80\x932005 for validation. The calibration results were found to be satisfactory with the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.88 and 9.70\xc2\xa0m3/s for the daily time step, respectively. Also, the model was validated successfully for simulating daily streamflow (NSE\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.80 and MAE\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8910.33\xc2\xa0m3/s). The calibrated and validated model was then used to evaluate basin response to the anticipated climate changes by the end of the 21st century. Twelve independent as well as twenty eight combined area-specific climatic scenarios were considered in this study to evaluate the impact of climate change on the hydrology of the basin. The analysis of model results for the 12 Independent Climatic Scenarios indicated a reduction in the surface runoff ranging from 2.5 to 11\xc2\xa0% by changing the temperature from 1 to 5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C, whereas the increase in rainfall by 2.5 to 15\xc2\xa0% suggested an increase in surface runoff by 6.67 to 43.42\xc2\xa0% from the baseline condition. In case of 28 Combined Scenarios compared to the baseline condition, the changes in surface runoff would vary from \xe2\x88\x924.55 to 37.53\xc2\xa0%, the groundwater recharge would change from \xe2\x88\x928.7 to 23.15\xc2\xa0% and the evapotranspiration would increase from 4.05 to 11.88\xc2\xa0%. It is concluded that future changes in the climatic condition by the end of the 21st century are most likely to produce significant impacts on the streamflow in the study area. The findings of this study and those of follow-up studies in this direction will be useful for guiding suitable adaptation measures for sustainable water management in the basin in the face of impending climate change.'

Abstract: 'The genetic variation of local subpopulations (Palni hills, India) of the blackfly Simulium gravelyi was surveyed at different altitudinal locations using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. By comparing the similarity of the bands produced by RAPDs, it may be concluded that there is variation within this population. These data suggest that the heterogeneity of band pattern of S. gravelyi steadily increased from low elevation to high elevation. Site 5 (1590 m altitude) was more polymorphic and it differed most from site 1 (290 m). This is established by the ecological diversity and statistical analyses (PCA) and predicting two major ecological factors of conductivity and current velocity. The speciation hypothesis is consistent with the molecular evidence, postulates a high elevational site 5 (1590 m) and a subsequent site 4 (1250 m).'

Abstract: 'The advent of modern forces and the changes in socioeconomic patterns of forest dwellers have increased the pressures on the forests. In order to mitigate such pressures and also to protect the forests and wildlife the model of protected areas networks has shifted and enhanced such pressures in the unprotected natural forests due to several reasons. Being a low profile category of protected status and continuous human settlements, the present study highlights the case of dry deciduous forests of Sarguja district of Chhattisgarh state of India. The major objectives of this study were to quantify the status of forests and wildlife and also to determine the extent of anthropogenic disturbances faced by the dry deciduous forests of central India. Transect and silent drive count methods were used for sampling wildlife and quadrat method was used for sampling vegetation. Besides, the local uses of various forest produces were also studied in view of understanding the people dependency on forests. The forest vegetation, in the study area, was pre-dominated by Shorea robusta, which had Madhuca indica, Diospyrus melanoxylon and Buchnania lanzan as the major companion species. The forest had either the high girth class mature tree species or the saplings. The low vegetation cover and density were due to the high anthropogenic pressures mainly in the form of heavy livestock grazing and collection of ethnobotanically important species. The study though reveals that the area is not rich in wildlife and the forest is fragmented, the area still supports some important species, which include many rare and endangered plants and animals. The findings of this study have been discussed in view of the management and conservation of the forest and wildlife in the dry deciduous forests.'

Abstract: 'Larvae of almost all of the 5,680 species of the insect order Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) are dependent on freshwater habitats. Both larvae and adults are predators. The order is relatively well studied, and the actual number of species may be close to 7,000. Many species have small distributional ranges, and are habitat specialists, including inhabitants of alpine mountain bogs, seepage areas in tropical rain forests, and waterfalls. They are often successfully used as indicators for environmental health and conservation management. The highest diversity is found in flowing waters in rain forests of the tropics, the Oriental and Neotropical regions being the most speciose. This paper discusses diversity, summarises the biogeography of dragonflies in the different biogeographical regions and gives the total number of species and genera per family per biogeographical region. Examples are given of areas of particular diversity, in terms of areas of endemism, presence of ancient lineages or remarkable recent radiations but no well-based review of areas with high endemism of dragonflies is available so far. The conservation status of dragonflies is briefly discussed. Species confined to small remnants of forest in the tropics are most under threat of extinction by human activities.'

Abstract: 'The bird fauna of logged and unlogged forest in Kibale National Park, western Uganda were studied and comparisons made. Species diversity and richness were higher in the logged areas. A single species, the Yellow-whiskered Greenbul Andropadus latirostris dominated in the logged compartment. However, the majority of individual birds found in the logged forest were generalist or forest-edge species. Over 84% of the forest interior specialist species that occurred in primary forest had recolonized or persisted in the logged forest; however, there were seven out of 48 understorey forest specialists that had not done so. Although there was moderate species overlap between the two habitats, the logged forest compartment had not fully recovered from logging after 23 years.'

Abstract: 'The use of paddock trees as stepping stones by birds was assessedin a grazing landscape in southern New South Wales, Australia. A totalof 70 paddock tree sites was surveyed for 20 min each inthe morning, and 36 sites were surveyed again in the afternoon in March2000. During the surveys, the presence, direction of arrival, anddirection of departure to and from sites was recorded for each bird. Astepping stone effect of paddock trees was examined in two ways: (1) byanalysing the arrival and departure direction of birds relative tosurrounding vegetation cover, and (2) by analysing the departuredirection of birds relative to their arrival direction. An arrivaldirection was obtained for 150 independently acting groups of birds, anda departure direction was obtained for 203 independently acting groupsof birds. Both arrival and departure direction were obtained for 87independently acting groups. Foliage-foraging birds tended to followrelatively densely vegetated areas. There was some indication thatgranivores and nectarivores also preferred to move along denselyvegetated areas. This trend was absent for open-country species. Allgroups of birds examined tended to return to their place of origin ormove in the opposite direction of their arrival. This trend was mostpronounced for nectarivores and the foliage-foraging White-plumedHoneyeater (Lichenostomus penicillatus), and lesspronounced for open-country species and parrots. The results arediscussed in relation to the biology and ecology of the various speciesof birds. We conclude that paddock trees have the potential to enhancelandscape connectivity by acting as stepping stones to assist movement.This further highlights their conservation value as demonstrated in thefirst paper of this series.'

Abstract: 'Land use and land cover (LULC) change have considerable influence on ecosystem services. Assessing change in ecosystem services due to LULC change at different spatial and temporal scales will help to identify suitable management practices for sustaining ecosystem productivity and maintaining the ecological balance. The objective of this study was to investigate variations in ecosystem services in response to LULC change over 27\xc2\xa0years in four agro-climatic zones (ACZ) of eastern India using satellite imagery for the year 1989, 1996, 2005, 2011 (Landsat TM) and 2016 (Landsat 8 OLI). The satellite images were classified into six LULC classes, agriculture land, forest, waterbody, wasteland, built-up, and mining area. During the study period (1989 to 2016), forest cover reduced by 5.2%, 13.7%, and 3.6% in Sambalpur, Keonjhar, and Kandhamal districts of Odisha, respectively. In Balasore, agricultural land reduced by 17.2% due to its conversion to built-up land. The value of ecosystem services per unit area followed the order of waterbodies > agricultural land > forests. A different set of indicators, e.g., by explicitly including diversity, could change the rank between these land uses, so the temporal trends within a land use are more important than the absolute values. Total ecosystem services increased by US$ 1296.4\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89105 (50.74%), US$ 1100.7\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89105 (98.52%), US$ 1867\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89105 (61.64%), and US$ 1242.6\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89105 (46.13%) for Sambalpur, Balasore, Kandhamal, and Keonjhar, respectively.'

Abstract: 'The dependence of coastal communities on mangrove forests for direct consumptive use due to the scarcity of alternate resources makes them one of the highly disturbed landscapes. This paper examines the spatial characteristics and extent of anthropogenic disturbances affecting the mangrove forests of Bhitarkanika Conservation Area situated along the east coast of India by using remotely sensed data and GIS, supplemented with socioeconomic surveys. The study reveals that resource extractions from these forests were considerable despite the protected status. Around 14% of the total fuel wood consumed annually in each of the household came from the mangrove forests of the Park. The patterns of consumption were spatially heterogeneous, controlled by the availability of alternatives, ease of accessibility, presence of markets, human density, and forest composition. The disturbance surface showed 30% of the major forest classes to be under high to very high levels of disturbance especially at easy access points. Besides, the distribution of economically useful species also determined the degree of disturbance. Resource use surfaces clearly identified the biotic pressure zones with respect to specific mangrove use and could be combined with the disturbance regime map to prioritize areas for mangrove restoration.'

Abstract: 'The Nawarangpur district, Orissa, a trop ical region with Sal mixed moist deciduous and Sal mixed dry deciduous forests, has been affected by extensive deforestation. The district was surveyed using Landsat MSS (1973), Landsat TM (1990) and IRS P6 LISS III (2004) satellite imagery. From 1973 to 1990, more than 888.6\xc2\xa0km2 of dense forest (rate of deforestation = 3.62) and from 1990 to 2004, 429.7\xc2\xa0km2 (rate of deforestation = 3.97) were found to have been deforested. The analysis of results identified the reduction in area of dense forest and increase of agricultural land, degraded areas of abandoned agricultural land and unproductive scrub. There is an urgent need for rational management of the remaining forest for it to be able to survive beyond next decades. From this study it can be concluded that temporal changes and the factors affecting these changes should be determined for sustainable management of natural resources.'

Abstract: 'Climate change can be particularly hard-hitting for small underdeveloped countries, relying heavily on natural resources for the economy and livelihoods. Nepal is one among these countries, being landlocked, with diverse physiographical characteristics within a relatively small territory and with rugged terrain. Poverty is widespread and the capacity of people and the country to cope with climate change impact is low. The country is dominated by the Asian monsoon system. The main occupation is agriculture, largely based on rain-fed farming practices. Tourism based on high altitude adventures is one of the major sources of income for the country. Nepal has a large hydropower potential. While only 0.75% of the theoretical hydropower potential has been tapped, Nepal can greatly benefit from this natural resource in the future. Climate change can adversely impact upon water resources and other sectors of Nepal. The source of water is mainly summer monsoon precipitation and the melting of the large reserve of snow and glaciers in the Himalayan highlands. Observations show clear evidences of significant warming. The average trend in the country is 0.06\xc2\xb0C per year. The warming rates are progressively higher for high elevation locations. The warming climate has resulted in rapid shrinking of majority of glaciers in Nepal. This paper presents state-of-knowledge on the glacial dynamics in the country based on studies conducted in the past in Shorong, Khumbu, Langtang, Dhaulagiri and Kanchenjunga regions of Nepal. We present recent trends in river flow and an overview of studies on expected changes in the hydrological regime due to climate change. Formation, growth and likely outburst of glacial lake are phenomena directly related to climate change and deglaciation. This paper provides a synopsis of past glacial lake outburst floods impacting Nepal. Further, likely impacts of climate change on other sectors such as agriculture, biodiversity, human health and livelihoods are discussed.'

Abstract: 'On the 23rd of February, some 50 Conservation Geneticists from around the global gathered for a half day symposium entitled \xe2\x80\x98Fragmentation Genetics in the Tropics\xe2\x80\x99 held at the Friedrich-Alexander University, Erlangen, Germany as part of the German Tropical Ecology Society annual meeting 2012. The overall aim of this symposium was to showcase the latest novel research applying molecular methods (landscape genetics, conservation genetics and phylogeography) to advance our understanding of genetic consequences of fragmentation in the tropics, particularly in the context of how population size and isolation influences population and species extinction. I provide a brief overview of the symposium and finish with a call for papers for a special issue of the sister journal Conservation Genetics, for which submission is now open.'

Title: 'Palynoflora from deccan volcano-sedimentary sequence (Cretaceous-Palaeogene transition) of central India: implications for spatio-temporal correlation'

Abstract: 'The sedimentary beds associated with Deccan Continental Flood Basalt (DCFB) sequences exposed in the volcanic subprovinces of Jabalpur-Mandla-Chhindwara (JMC) regions of Madhya Pradesh and Nand-Dongargaon (N-D) basin and the adjoining areas to the west in Yeotmal-Nanded in Maharashtra were studied for their palynofloral analysis. The sediments were characterized palynologically and changes in the palynoflora are observed at different stratigraphic levels in a number of sections including several new intertrappean localities recorded in recent years. For the purpose of effective correlation of different subprovinces, palynofloras of some of the previously studied intertrappeans are also reviewed. Our studies suggest that before the start of the Deccan volcanic activity, the palynoflora found in the Lameta sediments, was dominated by gymnosperms-angiosperm association. The plant canopy consisted mainly of gymnosperms (Conifers and Podocarpaceae) whereas, the understory members were mostly of palms and herbs (Poaceae and Asteraceae). The eruption of Deccan volcanic flows severely affected the existing floral association and proved fatal for the well established plant community. The immediately overlying sediments associated with the earliest volcanic flows are dominated by pteridophytes and angiosperm taxa (Azolla cretacea, Aquilapollenites bengalensis, Ariadnaesporites sp., Gabonisporis vigourouxii and Triporoletes reticulatus). Higher up in the stratigraphic sequence, similar forms continued with simultaneous appearance of new taxa including Scabrastephanocolpites spp. At still higher stratigraphic levels, abundance of fungi especially the mycorrhizal fungi, concurrent with sharp decline in pollen/spore recovery was observed. In the culminating phase (i.e. Palaeocene) of Deccan volcanic history a new palynofloral assemblage of typical Palaeocene taxa (Dandotiaspora dilata, D. pseudoauriculata, D. plicata, Spinizonocolpites echinatus, Matanomadhiasulcites sp., and Lakiapollis ovatus) was encountered.'

Abstract: 'We studied the regeneration of tree species in the sub-tropical forest of Alaknanda Valley in Garhwal Himalaya, India. The overall regeneration status was fairly good in the study area. Seedling density ranged between 520 and 1,240 seedlings per ha while the density of saplings varied between 400 and 800 saplings per ha. Out of eight sites studied, five sites, viz., A1, A2, B1, B2 and C2 contained the highest number of seedlings (280\xe2\x80\x93480 per ha) and saplings (200\xe2\x80\x93440 per ha) for Pinus roxburghii and remaining three sites viz., C1, D1 and D2 represented the highest number of seedlings (240\xe2\x80\x93400 per ha) and saplings (200\xe2\x80\x93240 per ha) for Anogeissus latifolius. The DBH class distribution of the tree species revealed that the highest number of individuals was concentrated in the lower diameter classes while smallest numbers were found in the higher diameter classes. Species such as Acacia catechu, Anogeissus latifolius, Dalbergia sissoo, Engelhardtia spicata, Lannea coromandelica, Mallotus philippensis and Pinus roxburghii have the largest number of saplings and seedlings in the lower DBH classes, suggesting that they have good regeneration potential. Other species such as Aegle marmelos, Bauhinia variegata, Bombax ceiba, Cassia fistula, Erythrina variegata, Haldinia cordifolia, Mangifera indica, Ougeinia oojeinensis, Phyllanthus emblica, Syzygium cumini, Terminalia alata and Toon a hexandra have either no or very small number of saplings in the lower DBH classes, which indicates that the status of these species implies poor regeneration.'

Abstract: 'The present study outlines an approach to classify forest density and to estimate canopy closure of the forest of the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago. The vector layers generated for the study area using satellite data was validated with the field knowledge of the surveyed ground control points. The methodology adopted in this present analysis is three-tiered. First, the density stratification into five zones using visual interpretation for the complete archipelago. In the second step, we identified two island groups from the Andaman to investigate and compare the forest strata density. The third and final step involved more of a localised phytosociological module that focused on the North Andaman Islands. The results based on the analysis of the high-resolution satellite data show that more than 75% of the mangroves are under high- to very high-density canopy class. The framework developed would serve as a significant measure to forest health and evaluate management concerns whilst addressing issues such as gap identification, conservation prioritisation and disaster management\xe2\x80\x94principally to the post-tsunami assessment and analysis.'

Abstract: 'Sri Lanka is one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. This study has utilized satellite remote sensing and GIS techniques to generate a nation-wide database on forests, forest types and land use/land cover of Sri Lanka. Spatial assessment of forest cover changes was carried out for the periods 1976\xe2\x80\x931985, 1985\xe2\x80\x931994, 1994\xe2\x80\x932005 and 2005\xe2\x80\x932014. The landscape fragmentation analysis has carried out to calculate the spatial and temporal patterns of forest. Land use/land cover map was prepared representing seven classes in 2014. The plantations occupy a large area (34.2%) followed by forests (33.4%) and agriculture (26.1%) in 2014. During the period of 1976\xe2\x80\x932014, the forest has been decreased by 5.5%. From 1976 to 1985 forest recorded a loss at an annual rate of 0.49%. This annual rate decreased to 0.01% during 2005\xe2\x80\x932014 indicates declining trend of deforestation and effective conservation measures. The study found deforestation hotspots in south east and northern most parts of the Sri Lanka. Total number of patches estimated has increased from 15193 in 1976 to 16136 in 2014. The study has found that main causes of deforestation in Sri Lanka were due to expansion of agriculture and plantations. The extent of change detected in the study through geospatial techniques has significance to the forest ecology and management of natural landscapes in Sri Lanka.'

Abstract: 'Understanding phyto-geographical distribution pattern and ethnobotanical applications are critical for comprehensive conservation and utilisation of native plant genetic resources. Dearth of such scientific reports on Corchorus species in India seriously compromises inclusiveness, precision and penetration of national endeavour to conserve the valuable resources. In this context, an ecogeographical study conducted to analyse geographical distribution, ecological adaptation, species richness and ethnobotanical applications of the genus in the country. The study revealed pandemic distribution of the genus with differential habitat preferences. Combine geographical, edaphic and precipitation based distribution profile of Corchorus spp. demonstrated multilayer interactions between species and environment that led to their differential spatial distribution. The highest species concentration was found in Tamil Nadu followed by Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Complementarity analysis showed that the major diversity hotspots for the genus present in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. Besides, wide spectrum ethnobotanical applications of the genus reflect their long association with prevailing ethnic communities across regions. Documentation of such time honoured traditional practices has special bearing on designing comprehensive conservation and management strategies. This information will help to prioritise both ex-situ and in-situ conservation efforts for the genus particularly in ecologically vulnerable sites of India.'

Abstract: '\nIn cashew plantations of south west Karnataka, India, foraging activity of 49 ants species belonging to 24 genera and 7 subfamilies were recorded. The study found that ants visited cashew trees regularly throughout the year. Myrmicinae ants were most dominant comprising 22 species followed by Formicinae with 13 species while, among Aenictinae and Dorylinae, only single species was found. Species richness was high in old cashew plantations recording 89.8\xc2\xa0% of total species, while medium and young plantations recorded only 46.9 and 24.5\xc2\xa0%. Dominance of different ant species was noticed on cashew canopy, trunk and soil in different aged cashew plantations. Old cashew plantations were characterized by Oecophylla smaragdina, followed by Anoplolepis gracillipes, while, Camponotus compressus and C. sericeus were dominant in young and medium aged plantations. Pit fall trap collection consisted mostly of Odontomachus haematodus, Lophomyrmex quadrispinosus, Technomyrmex albipes, Myrmicaria brunnea, Diacamma sp., C. compressus and C. sericeus. During flowering and fruiting period of cashew, foraging of up to 10 ant species was seen on the same tree at a time. Activities of most ant species were predominant during winter and summer which coincides with flowering and fruiting period of cashew (December\xe2\x80\x93May), while during heavy down pour of south west monsoon, activities of only 10 species were seen. A significant positive correlation was found between number of ant species and maximum air temperature (0.842) and also with afternoon soil temperature (0.925).'

Abstract: 'Taxonomic studies on scolopendrid centipedes have often documented variability at the individual and population levels and applied those data to questions of species delimitation, but these investigations have mostly lacked an explicit phylogenetic framework. A molecular phylogeny and recent taxonomic revision for Indian species of the scolopendrid Digitipes Attems, 1930, permit variability of traditional taxonomic characters for Scolopendridae to be mapped onto a phylogeny. Based on their fit to the tree using maximum likelihood, reliable species-level characters include the number of glabrous antennal articles, presence of a median ridge on the tergites, and presence or absence of a tarsal spur on leg 20. Characters that are conserved within and diagnostic for particular species but labile within others (typically with geographic structure) include the first tergite with paramedian sutures, presence or absence of a lateral spine on the coxopleuron, and the number of spines in a ventromedial row on the ultimate leg prefemur. Comparisons with published accounts of variability in species of other scolopendrid genera, particularly Scolopendra and Otostigmus, show that Indian Digitipes has conserved morphology in some characters that are taxonomically useful elsewhere in the family, and most of its taxonomically informative characters have analogous patterns of variability in other genera. The approach used in this study to evaluate morphological variation in a phylogenetic framework can be applied to other taxa in which morphologically cryptic species have been reported and where species diagnosis requires a combination of characters.'

Abstract: 'The present study deals with the species abundance, diversity and species richness of avian communities in the Bangalore University Campus (BUC), Bengaluru, India. One hundred and six species of birds belonging to 42 families under 68 genera were recorded. Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Wiener\xe2\x80\x99s and Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s alpha diversities, species evenness, species richness of bird communities, number of bird species and percentage of population density of birds between various seasons in the BUC differed significantly between the study years. Of these bird species, the relative abundance (6.96\xc2\xa0%) and species distribution ratio (0.070) of Psittacula krameri were highest, whereas relative abundance (0.04\xc2\xa0%) and species distribution ratio (0.002) of Coracias benghalensis were lowest. The existing 32 species of flowering plants/trees belonging to 29 genera under 14 families in the campus are used for perching by birds. Moreover 29 species of flowering plants/trees belonging to 24 genera under 16 families depend on birds for pollination and/or seed dispersal. Occurrence of greater bird diversity and abundance of avian communities were recorded highest in the winter season in the BUC premises. In the different seasons, the BUC had varying community structure of birds between the study years. BUC suffers from numerous threats namely grass cutting, fire and grazing of domestic animals. Conservation methods needed for habitat management are restoration of vegetation and wetlands, and increase plant and tree diversity to protect the ecosystem of BUC habitat and to preserve its diversity of avifauna.'

Title: 'Extraction of non-timber forest products in the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills, India. 6. fuelwood pressure and management options'

Abstract: 'Fuelwood is a predominant source of domestic energy for the Soliga, an aboriginal tribe, and non-Soliga people inhabiting the core and the fringe of the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) wildlife sanctuary in Karnataka, India. Approximately 7000 Soliga and 66000 non-Soliga people depend on the 540 km2 sanctuary for fuelwood. The demand for fuelwood is estimated to be 134.7 t d-1 or 49165 t y-1 against production of 66024 t y-1 for the entire sanctuary. Consumption patterns vary with the season and the altitude. The pressure for fuelwood is far greater on the fringe (85.8%) than in the core (14.2%). The fuelwood supply emanates from an activity zone of 20.1% of the total forest area which produces only 27% of the total demand. Furthermore, only selected species are preferred for fuel use, indicating that only a certain percentage of total productivity is available for extraction. Thus, the demandsupply gap is far greater than it actually appears. A wide gap between demand and supply demonstrates that the BRT forests cannot cater to the fuelwood needs sustainably with the prevailing patterns of extraction. Probable consequences of fuelwood extraction on biodiversity are discussed, and management options to meet energy requirement and to conserve biodiversity are explored.'

Abstract: '60% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystems are not used in a sustainable way. Modern agriculture is blamed for declining soil carbon and biodiversity. Climate change, habitat fragmentation and other obstacles impede the movement of many animal species, and distribution changes are projected to continue. Therefore, we need alternative management strategies. The colony organisation of social insects, especially of ants, is seen as a model to design an improved agricultural management, because ants are very experienced agriculturists. Ants represent half of the global insect biomass. Their individuals work like a super organism. This article focuses on harvester and leaf cutter ants by considering Lasius species. It reviews the organisation structure of social ant communities. Harvester and leaf cutter ants represent a high percentage of the worldwide ant societies. They collect plant saps with carbon nitrogen (C/N) ratios of about 40 for their own nourishment and leaf fragments with C/N ratios of about 100 for fungi gardens and brood nourishment. They sustain huge numbers of individuals with their low N-based organic imports and their colony commensalisms enable them to convert these polymers into lower molecular, partly volatile compounds, adenosinetriphosphate (ATP), and heat. Digging improves water infiltration, drainage and soil aeration. Ants maintain fungi as a food source for the scleroproteinous brood, carry out food preservation, infection control and waste management, and construct with endurance new nests and rebuild them after damage. All these activities move the nest sites far away from the thermodynamic equilibrium. Physical, chemical and biological gradients emerge and the growing populations, together with nest-penetrating mycorrhized plant roots, absorb the released nutrients and form biomass by lowering energy flows into potentially strong consumer-resource interactions or runaway consumptions. The plant material import of leaf cutter ants, rich in carbon but low in proteins, amounts to 85\xe2\x80\x93470 kg dry weight per year. It keeps the electron donor/acceptor ratio in favour of the electron donor so that denitrifiers can reduce nitrate predominantly to N2. Ants living in highly N-polluted areas bind the pollutant in the cuticle. In their low N-input environments harvester, leaf cutter and honeydew-sucking ants furnish the N demand of adult ants with the help of N2-fixing bacteria. The low N-input management of harvester, leaf cutter and honeydew-sucking ants is therefore a resourceful concept for approaching a highly productive agriculture by avoiding soil carbon decline and N2O emissions increase.'

Title: 'Threatened biotas: "Hot spots" in tropical forests'

Abstract: 'The mass-extinction episode underway is largely centred on tropical forests, insofar as they contain at least half of all Earth\'s species and they are being depleted faster than any other biome. But species distributions and depletion patterns are anything but uniform throughout the biome. This paper identifies 10 areas that, a) are characterised by exceptional concentrations of species with high levels of endemism and b) are experiencing unusually rapid rates of depletion. While these "hotspot" areas comprise less than 3.5 percent of remaining primary forests, they harbour over 34 000 endemic plant species (27 percent of all plant species in tropical forests and 13 percent of all plant species worldwide). They also feature 700 000 endemic animal species and possibly several times more. Unfortunately, they appear likely to lose 90 percent of their forest cover as soon as the end of the century or shortly thereafter, causing the extinction of almost 7 percent of Earth\'s plant species and at least a similar proportion of animal species, this occurring in only 0.2 percent of Earth\'s land surface. By concentrating on such areas where needs are greatestand where the pay-off from safeguard measures would also be greatest, conservationists can engage in a more systematised response to the challenge of largescale extinctions impending in tropical forests.'

Abstract: 'This paper identifies newer areas of arsenic contamination in the District Kanker, which adjoins the District Rajnandgaon where high contamination has been reported earlier. A correlation with the mobile phase episodes of arsenic contamination has been identified, which further hinges on the complex geology of the area. Arsenic concentrations in both surface and groundwater, aquatic organisms (snail and water weeds) soil and vegetation of Kanker district and its adjoining area have been reported here. The region has been found to contain an elevated level of arsenic. All segments of the ecoysystem are contaminated with arsenic at varying degrees. The levels of arsenic vary constantly depending on the season and location. An analysis of groundwater from 89 locations in the Kanker district has shown high values of arsenic, iron and manganese (mean: 144, 914 and 371\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg L\xe2\x88\x921, respectively). The surface water of the region shows elevated levels of arsenic, which is influenced by the geological mineralised zonation. The most prevalent species in the groundwater is As(III), whereas the surface water of the rivers shows a significant contamination with the As(V) species. The analysis shows a bio-concentration of the toxic metals arsenic, nickel, copper and chromium. Higher arsenic concentrations (groundwater concentrations greater than 50\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg L\xe2\x88\x921) are associated with sedimentary deposits derived from volcanic rocks, hence mineral leaching appears to be the source of arsenic contamination. Higher levels of arsenic and manganese in the Kanker district have been found to cause impacts on the flora and fauna. A case study of episodic arsenical diarrhoea is presented.'

Abstract: 'This study deals with the production of manure by two pill-millipedes (Arthrosphaera fumosa and A. magna) that harbour in the Western Ghat forests of India, from mixed leaf litter of three plant species (Lagerstroemia microcarpa, Pongamia pinnata and Terminalia paniculata) under laboratory microcosm incubation for 4\xc2\xa0weeks. Comparison of feed (applied as mixed leaf litter; ratio, 1:1:1 w/w/w) and manure (faecal pellets) of both millipedes revealed significantly lower total phenolics, organic carbon and C/N ratio (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) in the manure. On the other, the contents of total nitrogen and phosphorus were significantly enhanced (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). Our studies further indicate the possibility of harvesting the manure, from pill-millipedes fed on mixed leaf litter, with increased contents of nitrogen and phosphorus over a short duration. Performance of both manures showed similar impact with higher biomass of root and shoot, and length of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and finger millet (Eleusine coracana). During the third week, cowpea showed root nodulation indicating the presence of plant growth-promoting rhizobia in the manure. Depending on the geographical and environmental conditions, suitable pill-millipedes could be employed for in situ and ex situ manure production for improving agricultural productivity.'

Abstract: 'Carbon forestry mitigation potential estimates at the global-level are limited by the absence or simplicity of national-level estimates, and similarly national-level estimates are limited by absence of regional-level estimates. The present study aims to estimate the mitigation potential for a large diverse country such as India, based on the GTAP global land classification system of agro-ecological zones (AEZs), as well the Indian AEZ system. The study also estimates the implications of carbon price incentive (US$50 and $100) on mitigation potential in the short-, medium- and long-term, since afforestation and reforestation (A & R) is constrained by lack of investment and financial incentives. The mitigation potential for short and long rotation plantations and natural regeneration was estimated using the GCOMAP global forest model for two land area scenarios. One scenario included only wastelands (29\xc2\xa0Mha), and the second enhanced area scenario, included wastelands plus long fallow and marginal croplands (54\xc2\xa0Mha). Under the $100 carbon price case, significant additional area (3.6\xc2\xa0Mha under the wasteland scenario and 6.4\xc2\xa0Mha under the enhanced area scenario) and carbon mitigation is gained in the short-term (2025) compared to the baseline when using the GTAP land classification system. The area brought under A & R increases by 85\xe2\x80\x93100% for the $100 carbon price compared to $50 carbon price in the short-term, indicating the effectiveness of higher carbon price incentives, especially in the short-term.'

The present study showed the biodiversity of root colonization and AM fungi are active in nutrient cycling, survivals and seedling establishment of the plants in the Hazarikhil forest, plantation and nursery.'

Title: 'Climate change projections for Tamil Nadu, India: deriving high-resolution climate data by a downscaling approach using PRECIS'

Abstract: 'In this paper, we present regional climate change projections for the Tamil Nadu state of India, simulated by the Met Office Hadley Centre regional climate model. The model is run at 25\xc2\xa0km horizontal resolution driven by lateral boundary conditions generated by a perturbed physical ensemble of 17 simulations produced by a version of Hadley Centre coupled climate model, known as HadCM3Q under A1B scenario. The large scale features of these 17 simulations were evaluated for the target region to choose lateral boundary conditions from six members that represent a range of climate variations over the study region. The regional climate, known as PRECIS, was then run 130\xc2\xa0years from 1970. The analyses primarily focus on maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall over the region. For the Tamil Nadu as a whole, the projections of maximum temperature show an increase of 1.0, 2.2 and 3.1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C for the periods 2020s (2005\xe2\x80\x932035), 2050s (2035\xe2\x80\x932065) and 2080s (2065\xe2\x80\x932095), respectively, with respect to baseline period (1970\xe2\x80\x932000). Similarly, the projections of minimum temperature show an increase of 1.1, 2.4 and 3.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C, respectively. This increasing trend is statistically significant (Mann-Kendall trend test). The annual rainfall projections for the same periods indicate a general decrease in rainfall of about 2\xe2\x80\x937, 1\xe2\x80\x934 and 4\xe2\x80\x939\xc2\xa0%, respectively. However, significant exceptions are noticed over some pockets of western hilly areas and high rainfall areas where increases in rainfall are seen. There are also indications of increasing heavy rainfall events during the northeast monsoon season and a slight decrease during the southwest monsoon season. Such an approach of using climate models may maximize the utility of high-resolution climate change information for impact-adaptation-vulnerability assessments.'

Abstract: 'Ecotourism potentially provides a sustainable approach to tourism development in national parks. The paper focuses on ecotourism impacts and the status of wildlife within the Rajiv Gandhi National Park (Nagarhole) situated in Karnataka. It explores a multitude of interactions that exist among wildlife, conservation efforts, socio-economic, and relocation attempts of the tribal people in the park. Field exploration was undertaken to identify the impacts of ecotourism. The results revealed the ongoing effort by the government to relocate the tribal people within the park and the difficulty faced by park officials to cope with the numerous impacts and conservation strategies in the park. The tourists were engaged in different ecotourism activities and made an observation on the lack of educational awareness and biophysical impacts such as littering and vegetation damage. This paper will contribute a greater understanding of the impacts of ecotourism management for sustainability of the national park.'

Abstract: 'Food security is a problem in many developing and less developed countries due to increase in human population and decrease in crop productivity and food availability. Edible insects are a natural renewable resource of food providing carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals and vitamins. As such, entomophagy is common in ethnic groups in South America, Mexico, Africa and Asia, where indigenous insects are easily available and are consumed in various forms (raw/processed) or used as an ingredient or supplement in modern recipes. Entomophagy therefore offers an opportunity to bridge the protein gap of human foods irrespective of a few constraints that are discussed. Concerning food security, more attention is needed to assess and revalidate entomophagy in the context of modern life. Further research would be necessary to exploit insect biodiversity and ethno-entomophagy, stop overexploitation of these insects, and initiate actions for insect conservation.'

Abstract: 'A survey of anthropological, archaeological, botanical, and historical literature reveals that two species of fox-tail millet were domesticated in the Old World (S. italica, S. pumila), and one may have been domesticated in the New World (S. parviflora). Others were prehistorically and historically gathered and eaten as cereal starch sources, includingS. liebmannii, S. macrostachya, S. pallide-fusca, S. palmifolia, S. parviflora, S. pumila, S. sphacelata, S. verticillata, S. viridis, and perhaps others. The American species are briefly discussed and compared with the Old World plants, and a synopsis of food changes is presented.'

Abstract: 'Science is a global phenomenon that knows no frontiers. But in the real world, production and efficient utilization of scientific knowledge are highly concentrated in a few countries. A large majority of countries\xe2\x80\x94those on the periphery, contribute precious little to the growth of scientific knowledge. Indeed, the distribution of science is even more skewed than is the distribution of wealth among nations. As a result, peripheral countries are left out of the intellectual discourse that is at the very foundation of the knowledge enterprise. The extent of this skewness and the relative neglect of the perihpery can be seen in some quantitative form from publication and citation data. However, while it may be true that mainstream science has not greatly benefitted from the efforts of the periphery, scientifically advanced societies are certainly benefitting from the traditional medical and agricultural knowledge base of the peripheral societies. Countless numbers of plants used in the traditional medical systems of India, China, Africa and Latin America are being drafted into the western system of medicine. A number of multinationals are learning from folk medicine and are gathering tons of plant material from these regions for the manufacture of modern medicine.'

Abstract: 'Despite the extensive use of small millet landraces as an important source of nutrition for people living in semi-arid regions, they are presently marginalized and their diversity and distribution are threatened at a global scale. Local farmers have developed ancient breeding programs entrenched in traditional knowledge (TK) that has sustained rural cultures for thousands of years. The convention on biological diversity seeks fair and equitable sharing of genetic resources arising from local knowledge and requires signatory nations to provide appropriate policy and legal framework to farmers\xe2\x80\x99 rights over plant genetic resources and associated TK. DNA barcoding employed in this study is proposed as a model for conservation of genetic diversity and an essential step towards documenting and protecting farmers\xe2\x80\x99 rights and TK. Our study focuses on 32 landraces of small millets that are still used by indigenous farmers located in the rain fed areas of rural India and Nepal. Traditional knowledge of traits and utility was gathered using participatory methods and semi-structured interviews with key informants. DNA was extracted and sequenced (rbcL, trnH-psbA and ITS2) from 160 samples. Both multivariate analysis of traits and phylogenetic analyses were used to assess diversity among small millet landraces. Our research revealed considerable variation in traits and DNA sequences among the 32 small millet landraces. We utilized a tiered approach using ITS2 DNA barcode to make 100\xc2\xa0% accurate landrace (32 landraces) and species (six species) assignments for all 160 blind samples in our study. We have also recorded precious TK of nutritional value, ecological and agricultural traits used by local farmers for each of these traditional landraces. This research demonstrates the potential of DNA barcoding as a reliable identification tool and for use in evaluating and conserving genetic diversity of small millets. We suggest ways in which DNA barcodes could be used in the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Rights in India and Nepal.'

Abstract: 'Present study revealed the presence of 16 earthworm species belonging to 11 genera and four families viz. Megascolecidae (Amynthus alexandri, Metaphire houlleti, Lampito mauritii, Kanchuria sp1, Perionyx excavatus), Octochaetidae (Eutyphoeus gigas, Eutyphoeus comillahnus, Eutyphoeus orientalis, Octochaetona beatrix, Dichogaster bolaui, Lennogaster chittagongensis, Lennogaster yeicus), Moniligastridae (Drawida papillifer papillifer, Drawida assamensis, Drawida nepalensis) and Glossoscolecidae (Pontoscolex corethrurus) in the soils of five bamboo species [Bambusa balcooa (Sil Barak), Melocanna baccifera (Muli), Bambusa polumorpha (Bari), Bambus cacharensis (Bom) and Bambus bambus (Katabarak)] of West-Tripura. While four earthworm species viz. Metaphire houlleti, Drawida assamensis, Drawida papillifer papillifer and Pontoscolex corethrurus were common to all species of bamboo plantations, the rest showed restricted distribution. Among the earthworm species 4 were exotic (Amynthus alexandri, Metaphire houlleti, Dichogaster bolaui and Pontoscolex corethrurus) and the others were native to the Indian sub-continent. In general, earthworms under the bamboo plantations occurred within temperature range of 21.6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C\xe2\x80\x9328.0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C, pH 4.0\xe2\x80\x937.0, organic matter 0.56\xe2\x80\x935.99\xc2\xa0%, moisture 9.6\xe2\x80\x9331.7\xc2\xa0%, water holding capacity 14.6\xe2\x80\x9343.9\xc2\xa0% and bulk density 0.7\xe2\x80\x931.8\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0cm\xe2\x88\x923.

Earthworm diversity, dominance and evenness indices showed the values 1.00, 0.47 and 0.70 respectively. Earthworm density and biomass showed a negative correlation with temperature whereas those had a strong positive correlation with pH, moisture and organic matter of the soils.'

Title: 'Role of non-timber forest products in a subsistence economy: The case of a joint forestry project in India'

Abstract: 'Non-timber forest products (NTFP) such as fuelwood, fodder, fruit, medicinal plants, and small timber are important to the rural poor in India. The traditional usufruct rights that the poor enjoyed have been gradually eroded by state control. This process has accelerated with increases in the prices of timber and industrial wood products. Non-timber forest products collected by the poor do not enter the system of national accounts, which results in the undervaluation of the forest wealth of the country. According to some estimates, the total demand for these products outstrips the sustainable yield of the forests in India. To ensure the best use of the forests, it is necessary for rural communities to share the responsibility of forest management with the forest departments. A proposed joint forestry project in South India is discussed as a case study of this innovative approach to forest management. Data on the existing patterns of NTFP extraction are presented to gain a better understanding of the role that these products play in the life of the rural poor. Policies from the case study are discussed in the concluding section.'

Abstract: 'Serious attempts have been made to manage the highly populated Indian coast during the last 25\xc2\xa0years in terms of regulating the activities and managing disasters. This has lead to formulation of various policies to maintain environmental quality and sustainably manage the coastal resources. Basically, the coastal zone needs to address the demands of all the stakeholders starting from traditional local communities, administrators, to academic researchers etc. India has faced tremendous challenges in implementing regulatory measures like Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) issued in 1991 by demarcating countries coast in to four different zones with provisions and prohibitions for various activities. The concept of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) has been taken with the support of spatial decision-support tools derived from satellite data including national programmes on inter-sectoral approaches towards ICZM. 2004 onwards a series of disasters have reminded the necessity of having regulatory measures through implementable approaches. Subsequently, the CRZ 2011 notification has been a new addition to the list of policies using bottom-up approach as a good governance tool. The country has strengthened its potential in coastal management, disaster management and several community based field projects to enhance participation of stakeholders. This paper is aimed to critically review the processes that are made during the last two decades including the future challenges towards sustainable management of coastal zone with special emphasis on the three coastal areas from eastern, western and southern coast of India.'

Abstract: 'We identified 67 and 21 NTFP-yielding plant and animal species, respectively, in a reserve forest in Cachar district of Assam. We recorded globally threatened species listed by IUCN as Critically Endangered (plant species Dipterocarpus turbinatus), Vulnerable (plant species Aquillaria malaccensis), Endangered (animal species Hoolock hoolock, Indotestudo elongata and Manis pentadactyla), and Vulnerable (animal species Nilssonia hurum and Rusa unicolor). The whole plant or animal and/or their various parts were used as food or medicine, in house construction, magico-religious activities and others. While some NTFPs were harvested throughout the year, others were harvested seasonally. A comprehensive NTFP policy, along with scientific measures for regeneration, restoration and augmentation of NTFP-yielding plants and animals, would help in addressing the conflicting demands of conservation and livelihood in the forests of this area.'

Abstract: 'Selection of appropriate ecological niche model for predicting species niche distribution has been a challenge considering the type of species and input variables. Therefore, two ecological niche modelling approaches (Maxent and GARP) are employed to predict the present distribution of a planted species (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.) in two bio-geographical regions of India: Western Ghats (WG) and North east (NE) regions. The difference between two approaches is in the algorithm and kinds of species data (presence-only or presence and absence) used for model training. GARP over-estimates were observed more in NE as compared to that of WG. Maxent predicts Hevea distribution more accurately in both regions as it considers presence-only data, which appears to be more accurate for this species. The over-prediction of Hevea niche distribution by GARP especially in NE may be attributed to inaccurate and insufficient \xe2\x80\x98absence data\xe2\x80\x99 as compared to \xe2\x80\x98presence data\xe2\x80\x99. The model accuracy estimator, AUC failed to attribute the difference in model predictability between Maxent and GARP, whereas partial-AUC is found to be better estimator of model spatial accuracy. Therefore, Maxent is found to be more appropriate model for predicting the niche distribution of a plantation species like Hevea. '

Abstract: 'Although tropical rain forests represent the most species-rich terrestrial ecosystem on the planet, the three main rain forest regions (Neotropics, South-East Asia and continental Africa) are not equally diverse. Africa has been labeled the \xe2\x80\x9codd man out\xe2\x80\x9d because of its perceived lower species diversity when compared to the Neotropics or South-East Asia. Understanding why, within a biome, certain regions have higher or lower species diversity provides important insights into the evolution of biodiversity. I review the evidence in favor of an \xe2\x80\x9codd man out\xe2\x80\x9d pattern and the different hypotheses that have been advanced to explain and test this pattern using recent ecological, biogeographical and diversification studies. The \xe2\x80\x9codd man out\xe2\x80\x9d pattern has yet to be formally tested using extensive inventory plot data (including non woody species) between all three major rain forest regions based on appropriate statistics in an area controlled manner. The lower species diversity is not the result of a single cause, but is probably linked to numerous intricate causes related to present and past events. Future comparative studies should combine numerous variables including novel ones such at plant functional diversity. Finally, though more extinction in Africa is apparent from the fossil record, it is still hard to precisely quantify to what degree extinction varied between the three major regions. Diversification studies of important tropical plant lineages tend to support higher speciation rates in the Neotropics and South-East Asia instead of higher extinction in Africa as the main cause explaining the differences in species diversity. The lower species diversity of African rain forests remains an understudied question with numerous preconceived and largely untested ideas for which we are still far from having a synthetic explanation. This review highlights that there are still very little intercontinental rain forest comparisons of plant species diversity hindering any solid conclusions. To better address this, an integrative approach involving archeologists, climatologists and biologists coupled with data from all three regions should be privileged.'

Abstract: 'Grain legumes contribute significantly to total world food production. Legumes are the primary source of dietary proteins in many developing countries, where protein hunger and malnutrition are widespread. Grain legumes germplasm constitute ~15% of the 7.4\xc2\xa0M accessions preserved globally. Nearly, 78% of the CGIAR\xe2\x80\x99s, 0.217\xc2\xa0M accessions, have been characterized, compared to 34% of national genebank collections. Interestingly, limited data on grain quality are available as the primary focus has been on morpho-agronomic traits. Clearly, more resources should be targeted on biochemical evaluation to identify nutritionally rich and genetically diverse germplasm. The formation of core and mini core collections has provided crop breeders with a systematic yet manageable entry point into global germplasm resources. These subsets have been reported for most legumes and have proved useful in identifying new sources of variation. They may however not eliminate the need to evaluate entire collections, particularly for very rare traits. Molecular characterization and association mapping will further aid to insights into the structure of legume diversity and facilitate greater use of collections. The use of high resolution elevational climate models has greatly improved our capacity to characterize plant habitats and species\xe2\x80\x99 adaptive responses to stresses. Evidence suggests that there has been increased use of wild relatives as well as new resources resulting from mutagenesis to enhance the genetic base of legume cultigens.'

Abstract: 'Mountain front recharge (MFR) is the contribution of mountains to recharge the aquifers in the adjacent basins. The estimation of MFR is essential to obtain a detailed investigation of recharge of the groundwater at the mountain front. This study summarises the current understanding of recharge processes by comparing daily groundwater fluctuation to daily rainfall and identifies the recharge rates. The recharge rates vary with time due to difference in water table depth and travel time. Thus to understand the MFR along the foothills of Courtallam, a total of 14 surface water, rainwater and groundwater samples were collected and measured for stable isotopes. The isotopic data were used to investigate the recharge process and to identify the elevations to recharge. The study findings also suggest that predominantly rainfall along the foothills contributes recharge to the riparian zone (basin block region), whereas foothill regions receive recharge from rainfall over mountain block.'

URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02907331
Abstract: 'Sustainable extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) depends upon harvesting a small fraction of the total productivity. Over-exploitation can lead to a loss of biodiversity, but a low level of extraction, without value addition at the point of origin, is usually not economically feasible for extractors. Extraction and productivity levels per unit area for most non-timber forest products are unknown, nor do we have much information about value addition at various points in the marketing channels. Here we determine extraction and productivity levels for Amla trees (Phyllanthus emblica), which yield fruits that are used for a wide variety of purposes in preparation of various foods, beverages and medicines. We also present preliminary data on the price appreciation of the fruit for one of the processed products. We have determined that the current level of extraction, 60-80% of all fruits at the population level, may have a negative effect on new recruitment. We present a model for value addition that has the potential to enhance income and reduce the level of extraction. This model is currently being implemented by the Soliga community with the assistance of a non-governmental organization.'

Abstract: 'With Ernst Assmann\xe2\x80\x99s appointment to the chair of Forest Yield Science in Munich in 1951, he assumed responsibility for the maintenance of the extensive network of growth-and-yield plots of the Bavarian Forest Research Institute. This network, with some plots having been remeasured since 1870, proved to be a rich source of observations, and constituted the empirical basis for Assmann\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental theories in production ecology. Realizing the strategic value of long-term field observations, scientists are using (a) designed experiments and (b) observational studies to study forest structure and dynamics. This contribution is an attempt to clarify fundamental differences, and to present examples, of these two approaches. We present recent developments regarding the installation of Designed Experiments and show that rigorous experimental design, usually found in planted forests and based on very specific manipulations, that are normally not found in the natural environment is required to address a particular hypothesis that cannot be tested by merely using available observations. We also present examples of new Forest Observational Networks established in China, India, Africa and America. These alternative research infrastructures are especially suitable for the study of natural forests that exhibit a high diversity of tree species with varying size and age structures. Our conclusion is that Forest Observational Studies are emerging as an important alternative to Designed Experiments because they provide a vast amount of information about complex natural forest communities rather quickly. However, long-term commitment is essential to ensure a steady flow of observations about forest dynamics. Manipulated experiments and observational studies can be complementary, but the optimum use of both installations requires careful planning and coordination.'

Abstract: 'Microfinance projects now seek to achieve improvement in environmental quality in addition to poverty alleviation. Achievement of these goals may depend upon the economic and environmental impact of microfinance businesses. This study is a quantitative analysis of these outcomes for Ecodevelopment, an Indian microfinance project, which aims to prevent forest degradation by poverty alleviation. The study divides businesses into perishable goods, non-perishable goods, simple skills, and special skills and measures their economic outcome by two indicators, repayment percentage and continuity of businesses. The study examines the effect of loan amount on the economic outcome of businesses. To quantify the environmental outcome, it analyzes the use of firewood or fodder and release of pollutants by businesses. The results show that loan amount does not affect the economic outcome, special skills have best performance, and skills cause less pressure on forest resources. These results suggest the need for development of knowledge-intensive skills, involvement of institutions in the operations of business, and inclusive policies for protected area management.'

Abstract: 'Description of biodiversity is often cited as one of the most important actions necessary for conservation programs. There are more than 600 species of stingless bees spread over the Tropical regions of the world; though for various species, little is known about their biology and taxonomy. We sampled bees from feral colonies from various regions of India and compared them using wing morphology. The results of population analysis of the patterns of wing venation, using geometric morphometric techniques, suggested the existence of at least two phenotypic clusters within our samples of the so-called Tetragonula iridipennis complex. These findings were supported by other features, including differences in nest architecture. This helps to explain the patterns of variability found in stingless bees in India and also will be valuable for conservation planning.'

Abstract: 'The wide knowledge gaps in invasion biology research that exist in the developing world are crucial impediments to the scientific management and global policymaking on biological invasions. In an effort to fill such knowledge gaps, we present here an inventory of the alien flora of India, based on systematic reviews and rigorous analyses of research studies (ca. 190) published over the last 120\xc2\xa0years (1890\xe2\x80\x932010 AD), and updated with field records of the last two decades. Currently, the inventory comprises of 1,599 species, belonging to 842 genera in 161 families, and constitutes 8.5% of the total Indian vascular flora. The three most species-rich families are Asteraceae (134 spp.), Papilionaceae (114 spp.) and Poaceae (106 spp.), and the three largest genera are Eucalyptus (25 spp.), Ipomoea (22 spp.), and Senna (21 spp.). The majority of these species (812) have no report of escaping from cultivation. Of the remaining subset of 787 species, which have either escaped from intentional cultivation, or spread after unintentional introduction, casuals are represented by 57 spp., casual/naturalised by 114 spp., naturalised by 257 spp., naturalised/invasive by 134 spp., and invasive by 225 spp. Biogeographically, more than one-third (35%) of the alien flora in India has its native ranges in South America, followed by Asia (21%), Africa (20%), Europe (11%), Australia (8%), North America (4%); and cryptogenic (1%). The inventory is expected to serve as the scientific baseline on plant invasions in India, with implications for conservation of global biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'India\xe2\x80\x99s Gujarat state has a long coastline with rich maritime history. The entrepreneurial nature of its citizens enabled Gujarat to emerge as the most aggressive industrial development state in the country. Due to the availability of vast land resource for industrial expansion along the coast, affordable labor cost, sparse human density and liberal state government policies have significantly contributed towards the outburst of the industrial sector\xe2\x80\x99s growth across Gujarat. Ecologically fragile ecosystems such as mangroves, coral reefs, mudflats, salt marshes, sea grass beds and nesting sites of winter migratory birds are increasingly threatened due to direct and indirect pressure induced by the industrial and allied development projects. This article reviews the status of coastal environment in Gujarat state with an emphasis on integrated coastal management associated laws and regulations.'

Abstract: 'The Naaf River estuary is one of the large estuaries in the Bangladesh coastal region not to have been affected by extensive human disturbance. This research provides information about the fisheries diversity status by Estuarine Set Bag Net (ESBN) sampling relation to physicochemical variables in both spatio-temporal scales. About 25\xc2\xa0km of the lower estuary was divided into six zones for sample collection by considering the accessibility and availability of the ESBN operation, fish landing centers and location of the fishing villages. In total 48 samples have been analyzed which were taken throughout March to October 2006. To quantify the species diversity, all fisheries data were analyzed by using EstimateS and EcoSim software which accounts the different diversity indices viz., species richness, Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Wiener diversity Index, Dominance and Evenness index. The research results demonstrate that the Naaf River estuary is a habitat of 161 (species richness, Sobs\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89161, Choa 1\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89162\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892.34, ACE\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89161.73) different species which belong to 98 fin fishes, 23 shrimps and prawns, 13 crabs, 11 molluscs, 3 echinoderms, 4 other crustaceans; while 9 remain unidentified. Results on the aquatic environment, mainly salinity and turbidity were found to have a major influence on their occurrence and distribution. All the findings indicated that the Naaf River estuary is a highly productive system and provides a favourable environment for large variety of estuarine species assemblages.'

Abstract: 'The present study was conducted in tropical Sal forest ecosystem of the Doon valley in the Indian Himalayas to assess the critical load of sulfur and nitrogen and their exceedances. The observed pattern of throughfall ionic composition in the study are Ca2+>K+>Mg2+>Cl\xe2\x88\x92>\xe2\x80\x89HCO3\xe2\x88\x92>\xe2\x80\x89Na+>NO 3 \xe2\x88\x92 >\xe2\x80\x89SO 3 2\xe2\x88\x92 \xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x89NH 4 + >F\xe2\x88\x92. The sum of cation studied is 412.29\xc2\xa0\xce\xbceq\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 and that of anions is 196.98\xc2\xa0\xce\xbceq\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921, showing cation excess of 215.31\xc2\xa0\xce\xbceq\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921. The cations, namely Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, and NH 4 + , made a contribution of about 67% of the total ion strength, where as anion comprising of SO 4 2\xe2\x88\x92 , Cl\xe2\x88\x92, NO 3 \xe2\x88\x92 , and HCO 3 \xe2\x88\x92  contributed 33%. The chief acidic components were Cl\xe2\x80\x93 (12%) and HCO 3 \xe2\x88\x92  (8%), while the presence of SO 4 2\xe2\x88\x92  (5%) and NO 3 \xe2\x88\x92  (6%), respectively. Percentage contribution of bole to total aboveground biomass was \xe2\x88\xbc72.38% in comparison to 2.24\xe2\x80\x932.93% of leaf biomass, 10.34\xe2\x80\x9310.96% of branch biomass and 13.21\xe2\x80\x9317.07% of bark biomass. There was high and significant variation (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001) in the total aboveground biomass produced at different sites. The aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in these sites ranged between 2.09 and 9.22\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921. The base cations and nitrogen immobilization was found to be maximum in bole. The net annual uptake of the base cations varied from 306.85 to 1,311.46\xc2\xa0eq\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 and of nitrogen from 68.27 to 263.51\xc2\xa0eq\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921. The critical appraisal of soil showed that cation exchange capacity lied between 18.37 and 10.30\xc2\xa0Cmol (p+) kg\xe2\x88\x921. The base saturation percentage of soil was as high as 82.43% in Senkot, whereas in Kalusidh it was just 44.28%. The local temperature corrected base cation weathering rates based on soil mineralogy, parent material class, and texture class varied from 484.15 to 627.25\xc2\xa0eq\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921, showing a weak potentiality of the system to buffer any incoming acidity and thus providing restricted acid neutralizing capacity to keep the ecosystem stable under increased future deposition scenarios in near future. The appreciable BS of the soil indicates the presence of intense nutrient phytorecycling forces within this climate and atmospheric deposition in replenishing base cations in the soil, which includes intrinsic soil-forming processes, i.e., weathering. The highest value of critical load for acidity was 2,896.50\xc2\xa0eq\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 and the lowest was 2,792.45\xc2\xa0eq\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921. The calculated value of the minimum critical loads for nitrogen varied from 69.77 to 265.01\xc2\xa0eq\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921, whereas the maximum nitrogen critical load ranged between 2,992.63 and 4,394.45\xc2\xa0eq\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921. The minimum and the maximum critical loads of sulfur ranged between 2,130.49 and 3,261.64\xc2\xa0eq\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 and 2,250.58 and 3,381.73\xc2\xa0eq\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. The values of exceedance of sulfur and nitrogen were negative, implying that in the current scenario Sal forests of the Doon valley are well protected from acidification.'

Abstract: 'Flying squirrels are capable of gliding and one of the least known mammals of the world. Work on these animals is less and sporadic due to their crepuscular and cryptic habits. At the present scenario, a complete pilot study is in an urgent need to formulate conservation strategies and policies to conserve them in India. Therefore, a thorough review on biology and conservation status of flying squirrels in India is provided here. A total of 13 species of flying squirrels present in India i.e., Belomys pearsonii, Biswamoyopterus biswasi, Eupetaurus cinereus, Eoglaucomys fimbriatus, Hylopetes alboniger, Petaurista elegans, P. mishmiensis, P. magnificus, P. mechukaensis, P. nobilis, P. petaurista, P. philippensis and Petinomys fuscocapillus, wherein three are endemic to the country. P. philippensis has broader distribution and is found to be more studied than others. Eastern part of the country contains the highest species number (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa010) follows three in northern part, two in southern part and one in western part subsequently. All species are facing threat to their population due to native habitat loss, degradation and hunting. Harmonization, alliances and partnership between various stakeholders along with better application of standard techniques would be strengthen to develop conservation strategies and implementing their coordinated actions could preserve flying squirrels\xe2\x80\x99 future in the country landscape.'

Title: 'Environmental justice and the expanding geography of wind power conflicts'
Author: 'Sofia\xc2\xa0Avila'

Abstract: 'Wind power is expanding globally. Simultaneously, a growing number of conflicts against large-scale wind farms are emerging in multiple locations around the world. As these processes occur, new questions arise on how electricity from wind is being generated, how such energy is flowing within societies, and how these production-flows are being shaped by specific power structures. The present paper explores the expanding geography of wind energy conflicts by analyzing 20 case studies from across the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe. Based on the Environmental Justice Atlas database, it reflects on how land pressures and patterns of uneven development emerge as two features of the current expansion of wind farms. Following a relational analysis, these patterns are examined to interpret the plural instances of opposition emerging throughout the rural spaces of the world. The article argues that previously unexplored forms of collective action are expanding the scope and content of the \xe2\x80\x9cwind energy debate\xe2\x80\x9d. In addition to the claims of \xe2\x80\x9clandscape\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwildlife protection\xe2\x80\x9d addressed by the existing literature, this study sheds light on the rural/peripheral contexts where opposition emerges through the defense of indigenous territories,\xc2\xa0local livelihoods and communal development projects. The study contends that these \xe2\x80\x9cemerging storylines\xe2\x80\x9d embrace an environmental justice perspective when\xc2\xa0challenging the socially unequal and geographically uneven patterns reproduced by the ecological modernization paradigm. From this lens, cases of local opposition are not interpreted as selfish forces blocking a low-carbon transition, but instead, are understood as political instances that enable a wider discussion about the ways such transition\xc2\xa0should take place.'

Abstract: 'A key step towards the restoration of heavily disturbed fragile coastal wetland ecosystems is determining the composition and characteristics of the plant communities involved. This study determined and characterized the community of higher plants in the Chenier wetland of Bohai Bay using a combination of field surveys, quadrat approaches, and multivariate statistical analyses. This community was then compared to other adjacent wetlands (Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Laizhouwan, Jiaozhouwan, and Yellow River Delta wetland) located near the Huanghai and Bohai Seas using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Results showed a total of 56 higher plant species belonging to 52 genera from 20 families in Chenier wetland, the majority of which were dicotyledons. Single-species families were predominant, while larger families, including Gramineae, Compositae, Leguminosae, and Chenopodiaceae contained a higher number of species (each\xe2\xa9\xbe6 species). Cosmopolitan species were also dominant with apparent intrazonality. Abundance (number of species) of temperate species was twice that of tropical taxa. Species number of perennial herbs, such as Gramineae and Compositae, was generally higher. Plant diversity in the Chenier wetland, based on the Shannon-Wiener index, was observed to be between the Qinhuangdao and Laizhouwan indices, while no significant difference was found in other wetlands using the Simpson index. Despite these slight differences in diversity, PCoA based on species abundance and composition of the wetland flora suggest that the Bohai Chenier community was highly similar to the coastal wetlands in Tianjin and Laizhouwan, further suggesting that these two wetlands could be important breeding grounds and resources for the restoration of the plant ecosystem in the Chenier wetland.'

Abstract: 'This study assesses the potential impacts of future global warming on the carbon budget of terrestrial ecosystems across monsoon Asia using the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP) dataset. We used simulation results of two emission pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5), climate projections of five climate models, and seven terrestrial biome models to analyze the changes in net primary production and carbon stocks in the South, Southeast, and East Asian subregions during the period 1981\xe2\x80\x932099. The simulations indicated that by the end of the 21st century, net primary production would increase by 9\xe2\x80\x9345\xc2\xa0% and ecosystem carbon storage would increase by 42\xe2\x80\x9386 Pg C. The clearest climatic impacts were found when using the adaptation-oriented emission scenario (RCP8.5), which assumes a greater CO2 increase and a larger change in climatic conditions. Substantial disparities in temporal trajectories and spatial patterns were found in the estimated changes, owing to the uncertainties in the emission scenarios, climate projections, and ecosystem models. We attempted to derive consistent patterns throughout the simulations to specify potential hotspots of climatic impacts (e.g., soil carbon change in the southern Tibetan Plateau). Finally, we discuss changes to the climatic characteristics in the study region (e.g., a change in the rainy season), the implications for ecosystem services, and the need for collaborative field monitoring studies.'

Abstract: 'The study was conducted in south Rajasthan to explore diversity and species composition of Odonata from January 2013 to June 2013. Odonates were sampled from 13 localities i.e., Pichola lake, Udaisagar lake, Badi lake, Ghasa lake, Menar lake, Badwai lake, Rup sagar lake, Roli todgarh Wildlife Sanctuary, Sitamata Wildlife Sanctuary, Karmoi river stream in Sitamata WLS, College campus, Rajsmand lake and Meja dam. During the study period, a total of 1,290 individuals from 8 families and 54 species were recorded. 4 families and 28 species were related to Anisoptera, while 4 families and 26 species belonged to Zygoptera. Suborder Zygoptera were represented by the families Chlorocyphidae, Coenagrionidae, Lestidae and Platycnemididae, and suborder Anisoptera by the Aeshnidae, Gomphidae, Libellulidae and Macromiidae. Libellulidae was the largest family with 24 species, while the most dominant species was Brachythemis contaminata (21.80\xc2\xa0%). Orthetrum chrysis and Lestes sp. were found randomly distributed in the study area, while other were aggregated and showed habitat preference.'

Abstract: 'Insect communities associated with wood decaying macro fungi inhabiting fallen trees in Rajiv Gandhi National Park (Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, Karnataka) were investigated during 2005\xe2\x80\x932007. Fruiting bodies of 19 species of polypores were collected from fallen logs of different species at varied stages of deterioration. A total of 43,711 insects belonging to 91 morpho species from ten different orders were found inhabiting the fruiting bodies. Coleoptera was found to be the most abundant and species rich group. The insect emergence followed a temporal pattern. Some of the most common groups like Ciidae and Erotylidae had two or three generations per year. Ciidae was found to be the most generalist feeder, in which one unidentified species was found to breed on 11 species of fungal fruit bodies. There existed a niche partitioning among the insect communities in fresh and dried fruiting bodies. A mild positive correlation was found between the number of insect species emerged and weight of the fruiting bodies. The study elaborated the intricate relationships among wood substrates, fungal fruiting bodies and the insect faunal diversity it supports and highlighted the fact that the wood decaying fungi and thereby decomposing wood are important components of forest ecosystem, conserving valuable diversity of insects.'

Title: 'A viable alternative in vitro system and comparative metabolite profiling of different tissues for the conservation of Ceropegia karulensis '

Date: 2017-12

Abstract: ' Ceropegia karulensis is an endemic and critically endangered plant of the Western Ghats from India. Exploitation of the tubers and poor regeneration from seed has narrowed distribution and propagation of the species. There is a need to develop in vitro propagation methods for C. karulensis to alleviate these problems. Here, we optimized callus induction, somatic embryogenesis and microtuberization from different seedling explants viz. cotyledonary leaf and root. The environmental scanning electron microscopy was used to observe somatic embryonic origin and their developmental stages. Highest callus proliferation was recorded with 2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M 6-benzylaminopurine and 1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Somatic embryos derived from cotyledonary leaf explants were more proliferative than root explants. The combination of 2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M 6-benzylaminopurine, 2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M naphthalene acetic acid and 7% sucrose in MS media resulted in highest microtuberization. Further, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based metabolic profiling was carried out from native wild plants and in vitro callus tissues which identified various phytochemicals such as alkaloids, fatty acids, esters alcohols, etc. Multivariate analysis revealed the chemical disparities, where considerable variations were observed between native wild type and in vitro tissues, but no significant differences were found among in vitro callus from both root and cotyledonary explants. Overall, our results suggested that the production of various secondary metabolites found in C. karulensis was not affected by in vitro propagation and could be utilized in the conservation strategies for this plant.'

The species was found in wild as well as in homestead cultivation in North Eastern India and exemplify direct utilization of biodiversity by indigenous people.'

Title: 'Against the current: rewiring rigidity trap dynamics in urban water governance through civic engagement'
Author: 'Johan\xc2\xa0Enqvist'

Abstract: 'This paper investigates how the agency of local residents can affect persistent and unsustainable practices in urban water supply governance. Using a case study from Bangalore, India, we analyze a social\xe2\x80\x93ecological trap which developed after a shift to external water provision paired with rapid urbanization. The reluctance of forsaking initial investments in infrastructure and competence, and the subsequent loss of the local network of lakes built for harvesting rainwater, reinforced dependence on external sources while undermining groundwater levels in the city. These feedbacks made water scarcity a structurally persistent feature of Bangalore. This situation started to change when local residents recently started organizing to preserve and restore Bangalore\xe2\x80\x99s lakes. By entering collaborative management agreements with municipal authorities, these lake groups have restored and established effective protection of five lakes. Through a case study of this civic engagement we show that the lake restorations have the potential to counteract trap mechanisms by restoring ecological functions, and by reducing water scarcity as groundwater levels rise and authorities are relieved from maintenance and monitoring tasks. Importantly, these lake groups have also created opportunities for over a dozen similar groups to form across the city. This demonstrates that social movements can be an important source of change in social\xe2\x80\x93ecological traps.'

Abstract: 'India is one of the most water stressed countries in the world. However, despite appreciable increase in funding for water research, high quality science that is usable by stakeholders remains elusive. I argue that this can be attributed to the absence of research on questions that actually matter to stakeholders, unwillingness to transcend disciplinary boundaries, and the demise of fleld-work research culture in favour of computer simulation.'

Abstract: 'The CC genome of Oryza is found in nine species of Oryza that are distributed on all continents having a tropical climate. Three diploid Oryza species with CC genome are found in Africa and Asia to Papua New Guinea. In southern South Asia these three CC genome diploid species can be found, O. eichingeri and O. rhizomatis in Sri Lanka and O. officinalis in India. AA genome wild relatives of rice are also found in the same geographic region. Germplasm of both diploid CC and AA genome Oryza germplasm has recently been collected from Sri Lanka. AFLP analysis was used to compare the genetic diversity of the two Oryza genomes from a similar geographic region in southern South Asia. In addition, the diploid CC Oryza germplasm was also analyzed by RAPD and SSR methodologies and the combined results were analyzed. The results show that in southern South Asia the diploid CC genome species have a high level of genetic diversity compared to the diploid AA genome species. Molecular marker analysis revealed that populations of O. rhizomatis from northern and southeastern Sri Lanka are genetically differentiated. One accession of O. rhizomatis was aligned with O. eichingeri. This accession was collected from the site of O. rhizomatis that is the closest to a population of O. eichingeri. O. eichingeri showed lower genetic diversity than the other two diploid Oryza CC genome species. O. officinalis accessions from Assam, India, and China were genetically less diverged from O. eichingeri and O. rhizomatis than two accessions of O. officinalis from Kerala state, India.'

Abstract: 'Indian village ecosystems are diverse with respect to population pressures, agricultural activities and production, livestock composition, energy sources, economics and infrastructural capabilities. Natural resource degradation is a major global concern and the factors and processes leading to degradation are regional and scale up from the micro levels such as village ecosystems. There is need for integrated multidisciplinary approaches for monitoring the resource status and environmental issues at the decentralized level. This paper presents an approach to assess village ecosystems using a set of key indicators developed and tested across fourteen diverse village ecosystems of the Southern India. The concept of ecosystem services associated with village ecosystems of India has been described and adopted to identify indicators and assess issues and trends. Comparison across villages has been demonstrated and the indicators successfully reflected the key environmental issues at each village level as well as differences across villages. We also report unique cases of stabilized land use and \xe2\x80\x98desakota-like\xe2\x80\x99 trends from village ecosystem studied.'

Title: 'Spatial distribution and potential biological risk of some metals in relation to granulometric content in core sediments from Chilika Lake, India'

Abstract: 'The article presents first systematic report on the concentration of selected major elements [iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn)] and minor elements [zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co)] from the core sediment of Chilika Lake, India. The analyzed samples revealed higher content of Pb than the background levels in the entire study area. The extent of contamination from minor and major elements is expressed by assessing (i) the metal enrichments in the sediment through the calculations of anthropogenic factor (AF), pollution load index (PLI), Enrichment factor (EF), and geoaccumulation index (Igeo) and (ii) potential biological risks by the use of sediment quality guidelines like effect range median (ERM) and effect range low (ERL) benchmarks. The estimated indices indicated that sediment is enriched with Pb, Ni, Cr, Cu and Co. The enrichment of these elements seems to be due to the fine granulometric characteristics of the sediment with Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides being the main metal carriers and fishing boats using low grade paints, fuel, and fishing technology using lead beads fixed to fishing nets. Trace element input to the Chilika lake needs to be monitored with due emphasis on Cr and Pb contaminations since the ERM and ERL benchmarks indicated potential biological risk with these metals.'

Abstract: 'Debates on linking livelihoods and conservation through the commercialization of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) continue to hold significance considering the increasing market demand for NTFPs, its high economic value for forest-dependent communities and \xe2\x80\x9cenabling\xe2\x80\x9d neoliberal policies that are in place. Kerala, located on the southwest coast of India, flanked by the Western Ghats\xe2\x80\x94a UN declared biodiversity hot spot, on its windward side, is of particular significance due to the presence of the Ayurvedic industry\xe2\x80\x94a traditional medicine industry that procures 90\xc2\xa0% of its raw materials from the wild. In addition, the presence of a resource-dependent tribal population re-affirms the economic, social and cultural significance of NTFPs. Unsustainable practices and poor co-management and marketing arrangements have rendered the sector ineffective in terms of meeting livelihood as well as conservation goals in the region. Although new approaches such as NTFP certification are being recommended for India not much has been reported on its feasibility and/or implementation challenges. Focusing on the Kadar community of Kerala, this study attempts to highlight some of the issues within the sector and using an \xe2\x80\x9cinstrumental model\xe2\x80\x9d, present the benefits accrued from new strategies such as NTFP certification through quantitative and qualitative assessments. Last but not least, recommendations for the adoption of sustainable strategies in context with the existing policy environment are provided that may be broadly applicable to other forest-dependent communities in India and elsewhere.'

Abstract: 'Rubber growers in South East Asian countries are facing acute crisis due to the price volatility, sharp increase in cost of cultivation, increasing drought and declining soil fertility. With an objective to generate additional income and improve small-holder welfare by integrating diverse crops in rubber ecosystem, three experiments were conducted in Rubber Research Institute of India during 2001\xe2\x80\x932014 period. In one experiment, coffee, vanilla on Glyricidia standards, Garcinia and nutmeg were cultivated along with rubber without altering the planting design and density of rubber trees. Growth of rubber was significantly higher under mixed planting and yield was not influenced. Soil moisture status during summer and microbial population were higher in mixed planting system and soil nutrient status was maintained. Yield of all the intercrops was good during initial years. As the shade from rubber canopy intensified, Garcinia perished but vanilla and coffee continued to yield reasonably well. In another experiment, nine shade tolerant medicinal plants were evaluated in mature rubber plantation. All the medicinal plants established well and produced reasonable biomass, but the performance of Strobilanthes cuspida and Alpinia calcarata were comparatively better. In another study, it was observed that short duration vegetables like amaranthus and salad cucumber can be cultivated during the annual leaf shedding period in mature rubber plantations to meet part of the household requirement. The results showed that diverse crops can be integrated with rubber without any adverse effect on growth and yield of rubber. Crop diversification generated additional income, mitigated drought and sustained soil fertility.'

Abstract: 'Horizontally transmitted endophytes are an ecological group of fungi that infect living plant tissues and survive in them without causing any disease symptoms. Even as facets of the endophyte-plant symbiotic relationship are being uncovered, there is an increasing appreciation of the different growth substrates exploited by endophytes and the vast repertoire of secreted enzymes of these fungi. These attributes exemplify the striking biodiversity of fungal endophytes and should motivate bioprospecting these organisms to identify novel biocatalysts that might help address challenges in medicine, food security, energy production and environmental quality.'

Abstract: 'Mikania micrantha (Asteraceae: Eupatorieae), widely called mile-a-minute, has been a persistent problem to forestry, plantations and biodiversity conservation in southwestern and northeastern India, as well as in Andaman and Nicobar islands. To supplement the previously imported Trinidad-originating Puccinia spegazzinii (Pucciniales: Pucciniaceae), a different pathotype (IMI 393076) was imported from Peru, South America, after obtaining the import permit from the Plant Protection Advisor to the Government of India. The Peruvian pathotype was held in the National Containment-cum-Quarantine Facility for Transgenic Planting Material at ICAR\xe2\x80\x93National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources in New Delhi as a quarantine organism for pre-release evaluation. Screening of M. micrantha populations from Andaman and Nicobar islands (12), Assam (15) and Kerala (3) indicated their complete susceptibility to the Peruvian pathotype. In the host-specificity tests, the rust could not infect any of the 25 plant species in ten tribes within Asteraceae, which confirmed its safety to non-target plant species. Further, none of the 31 sunflower cultivars/accessions screened were infected.'

Abstract: 'Obesity is the most prevailing disease spread all over the world. Targeting lipid metabolism for the development of anti-obesity drugs is best therapeutic option. Primary drug target is pancreatic lipase which causes degradation of 50\xe2\x80\x9370\xc2\xa0% of ingested fat. In the present study cell free extracts of 70 endophytic fungi isolated from medicinal plants of Western Ghats were primarily tested for their pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity using chromogenic olive plate assay. Three endophytic fungi #6 AMLWLS, #59 AMSTWLS and #1058 AMSTITYEL showed reduction in the halo formation indicating potential pancreatic lipase inhibition. Further quantitative assays for pancreatic activity of these fungi were estimated using p-nitrophenyl laurate as substrate. The IC50 of crude aqueous extract of #6 AMLWLS was 2.12\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0ml\xe2\x88\x921 which is better than orlistat exhibiting IC50 of 2.79\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0ml\xe2\x88\x921. The crude compound was further purified by column chromatography. The pure compound was characterized to be an amino acid derivative. On the basis of classical and molecular taxonomy the bioactive fungus was identified as Fusarium incarnatum.'

Abstract: ' Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) being an eco-friendly bioinsecticide is effectively used in pest management strategies and, therefore, isolation and identification of new strains effective against a broad range of target pests is important. In the present study, new indigenous B. thuringiensis strains were isolated and investigated so that these could be used as an alternative and/or support the current commercial strains/cry proteins in use. For this, 159 samples including soil, leaf and spider webs were collected from ten districts of Kashmir valley (India). Of 1447 bacterial strains screened, 68 Bt strains were identified with 4 types of crystalline inclusions. Crystal morphology ranking among the Bt strains was spherical (69.11%)\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0spore attached (8.82%)\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0rod (5.88%)\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0bipyramidal (5.88%)\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0spherical plus rod (4.41%)\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0spherical plus bipyramidal (2.94%)\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0cuboidal (2.94%). SDS-PAGE investigation of the spore\xe2\x80\x93crystal mixture demonstrated Bt strains contained proteins of various molecular weights ranging from 150 to 28\xc2\xa0kDa. Insecticidal activity of the 68 indigenous Bt strains against Spodoptera litura neonates showed that Bt strain SWK1 strain had the highest mortality. Lepidopteron active genes (cry1, cry2Ab, cry2Ab) were present in six Bt strains. Further, analysis of a full-length cry2A gene (~1.9\xc2\xa0kb) by PCR\xe2\x80\x93RFLP in strain SWK1 revealed that it was a new cry2A gene in Bt strain SWK1 and was named as cry2Al1 (GenBank Accession No. KJ149819.1) using the Bt toxin nomenclature (http://www.btnomenclature.info). Insect bioassays with neonate larvae of S. litura and H. armigera showed that the purified Cry2Al1 is toxic to S. litura with LC50 2.448\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g/ml and H. armigera with LC50 3.374\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g/ml, respectively. However, it did not produce any mortality in third instar larvae of Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles stephensi larvae/pupae insects (100\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g/ml) at 28\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C and 75 to 85% relative humidity under a photoperiod of 14L:10D.'

Title: 'How much seed remains in the soil after a fire?'

Abstract: 'Soil seed banks that persist after a fire are important in fire-prone habitats as they minimise the risk of decline or local extinction in plants, should the fire-free interval be less than the primary juvenile periods of the species. In two common woody plant genera (Acacia and Grevillea) in southeastern Australia, we examined the size and location of the residual seed bank after fire across areas of varying seedling densities at three locations in comparison to the distribution of seeds in the soil at an unburnt site. We found viable dormant seeds remaining in the soil after fire (evidence of residual soil seed bank). A significantly lower proportion of seeds remained in the top 5\xc2\xa0cm of soil than at 5\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0cm or 10\xe2\x80\x9315\xc2\xa0cm soil depths, independent of seedling density or plant genus. This was due to greater germination, and possibly some seed mortality, near the soil surface. Reduced germination below 5\xc2\xa0cm was probably due to the reduced efficacy of the fire cues that break seed dormancy, a declining ability of seeds to emerge successfully from such depths, and the lower abundance of seeds in the soil at such depths. The magnitude of the residual seed bank was similar across 0\xe2\x80\x935, 5\xe2\x80\x9310 and 10\xe2\x80\x9315\xc2\xa0cm soil depths in Acacia suaveolens. For two Grevillea species, most residual seeds were at 0\xe2\x80\x935 and 5\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0cm. The residual soil seed bank in the top 10\xc2\xa0cm of soil after fire varied across sites with estimates of 0, 19 and 27% in G. speciosa and 23, 35, and 55% in A. suaveolens. At two sites, both species had similar residual seed bank sizes, while at a third, there were large differences between the species (0\xe2\x80\x9355%). The observed patterns imply that the fire-related cues that break seed dormancy generally declined with soil depth. For Acacia, seed dormancy is broken by heat shock, a fire-cue that declines with soil depth. Some 250 species (approx 15% of the fire-prone flora) in the region are thought to have dormancy broken by heat shock. For Grevillea, where seed dormancy is broken by the interaction of smoke and heat shock, at two sites, we suggest three possibilities: (i) the smoke cue declined with soil depth; (ii) both heat and smoke are obligatory for breaking seed dormancy; or (iii) the cues may be independent and additive and below the zone of soil heating, only a proportion of available seeds had dormancy broken by smoke alone. At a third site (no residual seed bank detected) the smoke cue was predicted not to have declined with soil depth. Up to 900 species (just under half the fire-prone flora) in the study region are thought to have seed dormancy broken by the interaction of heat and smoke during the passage of a fire.'

Abstract: 'A total of fifty-four endophytic fungi were isolated from living symptomless leaves, stem and petals ofRosa damascaena Mill. (Rose). Rose is commercially exploited for the essential oil which is used in flavour and fragrances. Methyl eugenol [1,2-dimethoxy 4-(2-propenyl) benzene] constitutes about 1.9% composition of the rose oil and also acts as a precursor for the synthesis of methyl DOPA an important vasodilator. Besides this, it is an important bioactive compound with wide range of applications in pharmaceutical and flavouring industries. So far, methyl eugenol has been extracted either from rose oil or synthesized. During the present investigation GC-MS revealed the production of methyl eugenol by anAlternaria species isolated as an endophyte of cultivated and wild rose. The present work indicates that endophytes not only duplicate the secondary metabolite composition of host plant but can also serve as important tool for the preservation of biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Plants are a valuable source of pharmacologically important compounds since these are traditionally important in medicinal systems. Medicinal plant-based ancient wisdom could serve as a powerful tool to facilitate focused research on natural compounds for the drug discovery process. Medicinal plants are more important sources for drug discovery, specifically lead molecules as these offer several advantages over the synthetic molecules. Since in post genomic era, molecular targets for most diseases are known, conventional bioscreening strategies for medicinal plants are not sufficient to fulfill the present demand. It makes the role of medicinal plants more significant than ever before. The rich heritage of Indian medicinal plants can be explored utilizing various computational approaches for bioprospecting in the post-genomic era. In this review, the authors explore how Indian medicinal plant legacy can be utilized in post-genomic era utilizing the computational, bioinformatics, chemo-informatics, genomics and systems biology approaches. This approach shall make possible the systematic analysis integrating traditional and modern data in order to validate medicinal plant based knowledge.'

Abstract: "Recent reports have suggested that a global decline in amphibian populations has taken place during the past few decades. Urban development is thought to affect the richness and abundances of species and, therefore, could be an important cause of decline. We estimated the richness and abundances of anurans in wetlands at a residential development and in similar wetlands at a nearby undeveloped park. The residential development originally was pine flatwoods habitat, as is the undeveloped park curiently. We also compared the anuran species' composition of the park in 1992 with the composition in 1974."

Abstract: 'Ridge top ecosystems (RTEs) are considered to be more sensitive to global warming as they are characterized by uniform sunlight exposure and low human interferences and hence are perfect places for monitoring and comparing the effects of climate change in species composition. The present study was carried out on RTEs of four different mountain ranges, viz. (1) Narendranagar\xe2\x80\x93Hindolakhal (2) Mussoorie\xe2\x80\x93Dhanolti (3) Chaurangikhal\xe2\x80\x93Harunta and (4) Dayara\xe2\x80\x93Gidara, along altitudinal gradient (situated below 2000 to above 3500\xc2\xa0m), in Garhwal Himalaya to understand the variation in tree composition and distribution range. 0.1\xc2\xa0ha-sized sample plot was used to analyze the tree species, whereas 5\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0m for saplings and 1\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa01\xc2\xa0m for seedlings. The tree layers on RTEs were consisted of total 69 tree species, belonging to 55 genera and 39 families. Shorea robusta, Pinus roxburghii, Rhododendron arboreum, Quercus leucotrichophora, Q. floribunda, Q. semecarpifolia, Cedrus deodara, Pinus wallichiana and Abies spectabilis were found as the dominant and well-occupied tree species on the RTEs from lower to higher elevations. The mean stand density was recorded as 597\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa029 trees ha\xe2\x88\x921 (ranged between 546 and 616 trees ha\xe2\x88\x921) with a mean basal cover of 77.25\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa017.90\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 (ranged between 54.43 and 102.83\xc2\xa0m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921). A traditional pattern for tree diversity was recorded which decreased with increasing altitude. The detrended correspondence analysis ordination plot clumped the species together which shared the same habitat and environmental conditions which revealed that elevation and geographic location were the dominant factors for regional differences in species composition among RTEs.\n\n'

Abstract: 'Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi have a worldwide distribution. However, the ecology of tropical ECM fungi is poorly documented, limiting our understanding of the symbiotic associations between tropical plants and fungi. ECM Basidiomycete diversity was investigated for the first time in two tropical rain forests in Africa (Western Upper Guinea) and in Asia (Western Ghats, India), using a fragment of the mitochondrial large subunit rRNA gene to type 140 sporocarps and 54 ectomycorrhizas. To evaluate taxonomic diversity, phylogenetic analyses were performed, and 40 sequences included from identified European specimens were used as taxonomic benchmarks. Five clades were recovered corresponding to six taxonomic groups: boletoids, sclerodermatoids, russuloids, thelephoroids, and a clade grouping the Amanitaceae and Tricholomataceae families. Our results revealed that the Russulaceae species display a great diversity with several putative new species, especially in Guinea. Other taxonomic issues at family/section levels are also briefly discussed. This study provides preliminary insights into taxonomic diversity, ECM status, and biogeographic patterns of ECM fungi in tropical two rain forest ecosystems, which appear to be as diverse as in temperate and boreal forests.'

Abstract: 'The taxonomy of the palaemonid freshwater prawns of Myanmar is reviewed and 19 species are recorded. These belong to three genera, with 17 species of Macrobrachium, one species of Palaemonetes and one species of Leptocarpus. The identities of Palaemon spinipes birmanicus Schenkel, 1902, and Palaemon naso Kemp, 1918, are clarified with both recognised as distinct taxa. The taxonomy of several poorly known species of Macrobrachium,viz. M. villosimanus (Tiwari, 1949), M. peguense (Tiwari, 1952), M. hendersoni (De Man, 1906) and M. platyrostrum (Tiwari, 1952) is revised and discussed. Five species are reported from Myanmar for the first time, viz. Macrobrachium lamarrei (H. Milne-Edwards, 1837), M. dayanum (Henderson, 1893), M. lanchesteri (De Man, 1911), M. nipponense (De Haan, 1894), and Palaemonetes sinensis (Sollaud, 1911). One new species, Macrobrachium lanatum, which is closely allied to M. scabriculum (Heller, 1862) and M. dolichodactylus (Hilgendorf, 1879), is described and figured.'

Abstract: 'Groundwater potential zones were demarcated with the help of remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. The study area is composed rocks of Archaean age and charnockite dominated over others. The parameters considered for identifying the groundwater potential zone of geology slope, drainage density, geomorphic units and lineament density were generated using the resource sat (IRS P6 LISS IV MX) data and survey of India (SOI) toposheets of scale 1:50000 and integrated them with an inverse distance weighted (IDW) model based on GIS data to identify the groundwater potential of the study area. Suitable weightage factors were assigned for each category of these parameters. For the various geomorphic units, weightage factors were assigned based on their capability to store ground-water. This procedure was repeated for all the other layers and resultant layers were reclassified. The reclassified layers were then combined to demarcate zones as very good, good, moderate, low, and poor. This groundwater potentiality information could be used for effective identification of suitable locations for extraction of potable water for rural populations.'

Abstract: 'Invasive alien organisms can impact adversely on indigenous biodiversity, while riparian invasive alien trees (IATs), through shading of the habitat, can be a key threat to stream invertebrates. We ask here whether stream fauna can recover when the key threat of riparian IATs is removed. Specifically, we address whether IAT invasion, and subsequent IAT removal, changes benthic macroinvertebrate and adult dragonfly assemblages, for the worse or for the better respectively. Natural riparian zones were controls. There were statistically significant differences between stream reaches with natural, IAT-infested and IAT-cleared riparian vegetation types, based on several metrics: immature macroinvertebrate taxon richness, average score per macroinvertebrate taxon (ASPT), a macroinvertebrate subset (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata larvae; EPTO), and adult dragonfly species richness. Reaches with natural vegetation, or cleared of IATs, supported greater relative diversity of macroinvertebrates than reaches shaded by dense IATs. Greatest macroinvertebrate ASPT and EPTO were in reaches bordered by natural vegetation and those bordered by vegetation cleared of IATs, and the lowest where the riparian corridor was IATs. Highest number of adult dragonflies species was along streams cleared of dense IATs. Overall, results showed that removal of a highly invasive, dense canopy of alien trees enables recovery of aquatic biodiversity. As benthic macroinvertebrate scores and adult dragonfly species richness are correlated and additive, their combined use is recommended for river condition assessments.'

Abstract: 'Most community forests in hill regions of northeast India have been managed by traditional local institutions for centuries and most of these institutions remain functional even today. Higher forest coverage on private and community lands as compared to government land indicates that traditional institutions effectively manage community forests in the region. The present study was conducted through a survey of literature and field work using participatory research tools viz., PRA exercises, group discussions and questionnaire interviews with key informants in northeast India. We categorized the institutions involved in conservation and management of forests into three major types: traditional, quasi-traditional and modern. Traditional institutions with hierarchal structure were found in all states and are intact and functional in the state of Meghalaya. Quasi-traditional institutions, a blend of traditional and modern institutions were prevalent in Nagaland while modern institutions have almost replaced traditional institutions in Mizoram. We recorded at least eleven types of community forests viz., group of village forest, village forest, restricted forest, sacred forest, clan forest, cemetery forest, regeneration forest, bamboo forest, recreation forest, village reserved forest and medicinal plantation in villages of three states. The tribal people, through long-term trial and error experiments, have developed an elaborate, functional and generally democratic system of conservation and management of forests and associated natural ecosystems. Several forest and natural resource management lessons can be learnt from the institutional structure and decision making system of the evolving and dynamic institutions of tribal communities of the region.'

Abstract: 'There is evidence that human beings are familiar with use of animals for food, cloth, medicine, etc. since ancient times. Enormous work has been done on ethnobotany and traditional medicine. Like plants, animal and their products are also possessing medicinal properties that can be exploited for the benefit of human beings. In India, many ethnic communities are dispersed all over the country and these people are still totally depended on local traditional medicinal system for their health care. India is gifted with faunal and floral biodiversity, Mount Abu wildlife sanctuary is also one of them, and thus the aim of this work was to take an ethnozoological field survey among Garasiya people (main tribal group of this area) in the adjoining areas of this sanctuary.'

Abstract: 'The Andaman and Nicobar (A&N) group of islands is immensely rich in plant biodiversity. Andaman\xe2\x80\x99s native tribes are hunter-gatherers, sustaining on wild or marine food and practically do not have any cultivation. Diversity in cultivated crops is presently maintained in home gardens by settlers from the mainland and other adjoining countries. The National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) through explorations either alone or in association with CARI or with other ICAR institutes has collected 1234 accessions in 48 exploration and collection missions. Variability was collected in rice, cowpea, black gram, green gram, okra, Chinese spinach, ash gourd, taro, cucumber, pumpkin, bottle gourd, ridge gourd, bitter gourd, chilli, greater yam and coconut. Indigenous landraces are absent. The in\xc2\xa0situ conservation of the wild relatives of crops is well taken care of by a large number of protected forest reserves.'

Abstract: 'Sustainable use of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) can be affected by levels of extractions as well as by other anthropogenic influences such as fire and grazing. We examined the effects of fire on the demography of Phyllanthus emblica, an important NTFP in the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills, India. We then assessed demographic responses to the combined effects of fire and current fruit harvesting patterns. Fruits of Phyllanthus are commercially harvested by an indigenous forest dwelling people. Using matrix population models, we compared demographic indices across a chronosequence of time since last fire. Population growth rates (\xce\xbb) ranged from 0.7692 to 1.1443 across the five times since last fire. \xce\xbb was the lowest at times since last fire of 2 and 3\xc2\xa0yr. Frequent fires increased time to maturity by altering growth and survival rates, thereby causing a demographic shift from growth to regressions or negative growth. Elasticity analysis revealed that stasis of adults makes the biggest contribution to \xce\xbb. Simulations of periodic and stochastic fire regimes suggest that higher \xce\xbb and population persistence can be achieved at fire-return intervals of \xe2\x89\xa57 and \xe2\x89\xa59\xc2\xa0yr, respectively. These fire-return intervals became longer when the simulations included harvesting and fire. Extinction probabilities under the current fire regimes (every 2\xe2\x80\x933\xc2\xa0yr) suggest that populations will decline to lower densities. Our findings provide critical information for developing guidelines for sustainable use and management of NTFPs in Biligiri Rangan Hills, and demonstrate the need to incorporate various human-generated physical regimes in assessing sustainability of NTFPs.'

Title: 'Ecology of acoustic signalling and the problem of masking interference in insects'

Abstract: 'The efficiency of long-distance acoustic signalling of insects in their natural habitat is constrained in several ways. Acoustic signals are not only subjected to changes imposed by the physical structure of the habitat such as attenuation and degradation but also to masking interference from co-occurring signals of other acoustically communicating species. Masking interference is likely to be a ubiquitous problem in multi-species assemblages, but successful communication in natural environments under noisy conditions suggests powerful strategies to deal with the detection and recognition of relevant signals. In this review we present recent work on the role of the habitat as a driving force in shaping insect signal structures. In the context of acoustic masking interference, we discuss the ecological niche concept and examine the role of acoustic resource partitioning in the temporal, spatial and spectral domains as sender strategies to counter masking. We then examine the efficacy of different receiver strategies: physiological mechanisms such as frequency tuning, spatial release from masking and gain control as useful strategies to counteract acoustic masking. We also review recent work on the effects of anthropogenic noise on insect acoustic communication and the importance of insect sounds as indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem health.'

Title: 'Tourism as a threat to critically endangered and endangered birds: global patterns and trends in conservation hotspots'

Abstract: 'More than 12\xc2\xa0% of bird species are threatened with extinction. Numerous anthropogenic activities and processes are considered responsible for such declines, including tourism related activities. These activities often occur in global biodiversity hotspots but few\xc2\xa0studies consider the potential risks associated with tourism. The relative importance of tourism as a threat to birds was quantified using a global analysis of the threats facing critically endangered and endangered birds in the hotspots. Sixty-three critically endangered and endangered bird species are reportedly threatened by tourism. Among those 63 species, marine, coastal and aquatic birds are threatened more by tourism than was expected. Hotspots with the most species threatened by tourism are Polynesia\xe2\x80\x93Micronesia and the Mediterranean Basin. This study uses individual threatening processes in a new way to characterise hotspots for conservation action, advancing previous identification criteria. Analysing hotspots in terms of the relative presence of individual threatening processes may help to more effectively direct future research in these priority regions.'

Abstract: 'The handicrafts made fromSyngonanthus nitens scapes have been an important source of income for rural communities in the Jalap\xc3\xa3o region of Brazil since the late 1990s. This study analyzedS. nitens harvest and management techniques and the economic importance of the handicrafts. We also tested the effects of harvest onS. nitens population ecology. Handicrafts provide about US$1,800/year per artisan, being especially important to women. Experimental scape harvesting in mid-October, which is when knowledgeable artisans harvest and when the seeds are mature, had no consistent effects on population density, plant survival, or reproduction (clonal or sexual) after one year. Since 40% of the new recruits come from seeds, harvest after seed maturation, combined with removal of only the scapes and not the flowerheads, can allow forS. nitens seeds to remain in the populations and help ensure sustainability of the growingS. nitens handicraft activity. Important economic aspects ofS. nitens harvest sustainability include the high value of the handicrafts and the fact they are not perishable.'

Abstract: 'Information on landuse/landcover change is a critical input for natural resource management policy decisions. Remote sensing data under GIS domain were utilized to evaluate the changes in land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) spanning a period of thirty three years during 1975 to 2008 along the Dhansiri River channel, Assam, India. Seven different types of LU/LC were categorized and out of them cropland was evident as the most important landuse/landcover practices followed by dense mixed jungle in 1975 and the settlement in 2008. Significant reduction (13.02%) in cropland area to settlement was observed. Moreover, teagarden also occupies 0.77% of the total area from cropland and open mixed jungle. The changes in the areas of swampy land as evident from the present study in turn will impact the environmental quality around it and will help to increase the surface run off leading to enhancement of erosion processes. It is believed that the present study will help to contribute towards sustainable land-use planning and management towards protection of extremely rich biodiversity of the North East India with mighty Brahmaputra River system.'

Abstract: 'Recent advances in Deccan volcanic studies indicate three volcanic phases with the phase-1 at 67.5 Ma followed by a 2 m.y. period of quiescence. Phase-2 marks the main Deccan volcanic eruptions in Chron 29r near the end of the Maastrichtian and accounts for \xe2\x88\xbc80% of the entire 3500 m thick Deccan lava pile. At least four of the world\xe2\x80\x99s longest lava flows spanning 1000 km across India and out into the Gulf of Bengal mark phase-2. The final phase-3 was smaller, coincided with the early Danian Chron 29n and also witnessed several of the longest lava flows.'

Abstract: 'This paper investigates how changes in neighborhood facilities\xe2\x80\x94new schools, health posts, bus services, mills, dairies, agricultural cooperatives, and other facilities\xe2\x80\x94influence perceptions of environmental degradation. We use three types of data from a rural area in Nepal: (1) data on changing neighborhood facilities from 171 neighborhoods, collected using ethnographic, survey, and archival methods; (2) survey data on household characteristics and environmental perceptions from 1,651 households; and (3) individual-level survey data. We find that new neighborhood facilities are associated with perceptions of environmental degradation. This is important because perceptions may indicate objective environmental degradation, encourage participation in programs to improve the environmental, and influence environmental behavior.'

Abstract: ' Healing Animals, Feeding Souls: Ethnobotanical Values at Sacred Sites in Central Italy. Ethnobotanical knowledge is a fundamental repository of the values and applications of different plants. This knowledge is often related to spiritual beliefs and religious sites, where plants have been nurtured and conserved for their use in rituals and traditional practices. While this link is well known for different areas of the global south, it has hardly been investigated in relatively more secular and modernized Western contexts. Here, we use first\xe2\x80\x93hand vegetation surveys and published records to examine the occurrence of ethnobotanical values at 30 Catholic shrines in Central Italy, and compare them with an equal number of non\xe2\x80\x93sacred control sites. We ask this: to what extent is there an association of useful plants with sacred places in Italy, as found in other cultural contexts? We show that a greater number of useful plants are found at sacred sites. While this is mainly a consequence of the higher species richness of sacred sites, an association with plants used in animal husbandry is particularly evident, and likely related to the deep historical connection between sacred places and pastoralist traditions in Central Italy. Also, we show that there are significant variations in the distribution of old trees; the largest specimens are found at the center of sacred sites, while tree size visibly decreases away from the shrines. This indicates also that individual trees have been actively managed and conserved at sacred sites, probably driven by the symbolic values that old trees frequently embody.'

Abstract: 'A study was conducted to characterize the land use, biomass and carbon status of dry tropical forest in Raipur district of Chhattisgarh, India using satellite remote sensing data and GIS techniques in the year of 2001\xe2\x80\x932002. The main forest types observed in the area are Teak forest, mixed forest, degraded forest and Sal mixed forest. The aspect and slope of the sites influenced the forest vegetation types, biomass and carbon storage in the different forests. The standing volume, above ground biomass and carbon storage varied from 35.59 to 64.31 m3\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, 45.94 to 78.31 Mg\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, and 22.97 to 33.27 Mg\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively among different forest types. The highest volumes, above ground biomass and carbon storage per hectare were found in the mixed forest and lowest in the degraded forest. The total standing carbon present in the entire study area was 78170.72 Mg in mixed forest, 81656.91 Mg in Teak forest, 7833.23 Mg in degraded forest and 7470.45 Mg in Sal mixed forest, respectively. The study shows that dry tropical forests of the studied area in Chhattisgarh are in growing stage and have strong potential for carbon sequestration.'

Abstract: 'Caecilians of the genus Ichthyophis Fitzinger, 1826 are among the most poorly known amphibian taxa within Southeast Asia. Populations of Ichthyophis from the Indochina region (comprising Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam) have been assigned to five taxa: Ichthyophis acuminatus, Ichthyophis bannanicus, Ichthyophis kohtaoensis, Ichthyophis laosensis, and Ichthyophis nguyenorum. Barcoding of recently collected specimens indicates that Indochinese congeners form a clade that includes several morphologically and genetically distinct but yet undescribed species. Although body coloration is supported by the molecular analyses as a diagnostic character at species level, unstriped forms are paraphyletic with respect to striped Ichthyophis. Based on our morphological and molecular analyses, three distinct unstriped ichthyophiid species, Ichthyophis cardamomensis sp. nov. from western Cambodia, Ichthyophis catlocensis sp. nov. from southern Vietnam, and Ichthyophis chaloensis sp. nov. from central Vietnam are described as new herein, almost doubling the number of Ichthyophis species known from the Indochinese region. All three new species differ from their unstriped congeners in a combination of morphological and molecular traits. In addition, redescriptions of three unstriped Ichthyophis species (Ichthyophis acuminatus, I. laosensis, I. youngorum) from Indochina and adjacent Thailand are provided.'

Abstract: 'Eighty four different fungal endophytes isolated from sea grasses (5), marine algae (36) and leaves or barks of forest trees (43) were grown in vitro and the secondary metabolites secreted by them were harvested by immobilizing them on XAD beads. These metabolites were eluted with methanol and screened using SYBR Green I assay for their antiplasmodial activity against blood stage Plasmodium falciparum in human red blood cell culture. Our results revealed that fungal endophytes belonging to diverse genera elaborate antiplasmodial metabolites. A Fusarium sp. (580, IC50: 1.94 \xce\xbcg ml\xe2\x88\x921) endophytic in a marine alga and a Nigrospora sp. (151, IC50: 2.88 \xce\xbcg ml\xe2\x88\x921) endophytic in a tree species were subjected to antiplasmodial activity-guided reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography separation. Purification led to potentiation as reflected in IC50 values of 0.12 \xce\xbcg ml-1 and 0.15 \xce\xbcg ml\xe2\x88\x921 for two of the fractions obtained from 580. Our study adds further credence to the notion that fungal endophytes are a potential storehouse for a variety of novel secondary metabolites vested with different bioactivities including some that can stall the growth of the malaria parasite.'

Abstract: 'The major hydrological and geographic characteristics of the Godavari River and the coastal zone of the Bay of Bengal that have their effect on the hydrological regime and the morphological structure of the river delta are considered. The hydrographic, climatic, and environmental conditions in the Godavari delta are described. The specific features of hydrological processes in the delta are considered, including river and bay water mixing and the impact of tropic storms and hurricanes on the delta. The main features of morphological processes in the delta are revealed, including cyclic changes in the delta in Holocene and the dynamics of the channel network and delta coastline in the past 150 years. It is shown that the processes of erosion and retreat of the delta coastline became more active in the late XX century.'

Abstract: 'Anthra, an organization of women veterinary scientists working in the field of livestock production and development, has been involved since 1996 in a research project to document and validate local ethnoveterinary and animal management practices carried out by livestock-rearing communities in different parts of the states of Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra in India. Communal knowledge and innovation are an integral part of the day-to-day healing and management practices of farmers in all areas and over 80% of farmers continue to use these because they are easily and quickly available, especially in remote villages. However, this knowledge is today rapidly being lost. Farmers, both men and women, have expressed a keen desire to increase their own knowledge of these systems. This paper outlines the validation framework evolved by Anthra, wherein farmers using these medicines are actively participating in an evaluation process. Major findings are that local practices are effective, participating farmers use them confidently and other farmers are keen to use and increase their knowledge of them.'

Abstract: 'We investigated the phytosociology, structure and dynamics of Pinus roxburghii in 40 stands in northern areas of Pakistan by using cluster analysis (Ward\xe2\x80\x99s agglomerative clustering) and ordination (Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling). Cluster analysis revealed three major groups associated with specific environmental characteristics: (1) P. roxburghii (2) Pinus-Quercus baloot and (3) Pinus-Olea ferruginea community types. NMS-ordination showed the major gradient as an amalgam of elevation (r 2 = 0.441, p <0.01) and slope (r 2 = 0.391, p <0.05) as the two topographic factors correlated with species distribution. The first ordination axis also showed positive correlation with soil variables like pH and electrical conductivity, suggesting that soil chemistry was related to topographic characteristics and probably acted as a secondary gradient. We also examined size class distributions, age structures and growth rates of the three communities in order to describe community development and dynamics. Total tree density was 14700 plants/ha, with P. roxburghii having a relative density of 82% to 100%. Density of juvenile and total density and basal area of the subordinate tree species were low. The low density of trees in the smallest diameter size-class suggested that the recruitment of small P. roxburghii plants into the adult population may be lower than the required replacement rate for the stands. Pooled size-class distributions for the species showed a multimodal pattern with some regeneration gaps. Browsing, heavy logging and other anthropogenic activities were the overriding factors responsible for the poor recruitment of P. roxburghii. We concluded from the age structure that the forests were characterized by the dominance of young trees. Growth rate analysis revealed that P. roxburghii was the fastest growing species among the conifers species in Pakistan. In view of its relatively fast growth and longevity, P. roxburghii seems to be a suitable choice for short-term cultural practices in order to enhance wood production in lesser Himalaya and Hindukush ranges of Pakistan.'

Abstract: 'Land use/land cover change dynamics along the estuarine complex of Mandovi\xe2\x80\x93Zuari in the coastal state of Goa, India is studied by the application of multi-temporal remote sensing data. This tropical estuarine region has faced significant changes in the last few decades due to diverse pressures from various sectors, mainly of anthropogenic origin. Spatial and temporal changes in the LU/LC classes have been evaluated using satellite datasets from Landsat MSS, TM and IRS-LISS III for the years 1973, 1989, 2001 and 2011. Considering a spectrally heterogeneous landscape of the region, the LU/LC changes are identified by using principal component analysis (PCA) as a pre-classification step, followed by the implementation of a combination of supervised and unsupervised classification called hybrid classification. The application of PCA has proved to be suitable to successfully identify discrete land surface classes for this study area. An overall accuracy of 95.56\xc2\xa0% (kappa\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.9556), 92.93\xc2\xa0% (kappa\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.92), 84.64\xc2\xa0% (kappa\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.85) and 86.36\xc2\xa0% (kappa\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.85) has been obtained for the year 2011, 2001, 1989 and 1973, respectively. The study reveals a gradual increase in built-up area due to urbanization corresponding to a decrease in agricultural land and a considerable loss in beach area. Changes in the mangroves are also assessed within this extent as Goa has significant pockets of mangroves which are located mainly along the estuarine complexes of Mandovi and Zuari (along with the Cumbarjua canal complex). The results highlight an increase in mangrove coverage within the study extent by 1,585.8\xc2\xa0ha from 1973 to 2011. The mangrove areal extent along Mandovi has increased from 149.45 to 1,059.77\xc2\xa0ha and from 142.95 to 676.12\xc2\xa0ha along Zuari (including Cumbarjua canal). Increasing awareness and the steps taken by the forest department to provide suitable environment for the growth of mangroves are the main reasons for this increment.'

Abstract: 'Plant probiotic potential of rhizosphere microbiome and its role in phytofertilizer mobilization are\xc2\xa0largely unexplored. In the current study, the rhizobacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens R68 (PFR68) isolated from Western Ghat was analyzed for its growth enhancement effect on the leafy vegetable Amaranthus tricolor (L.). One month of field growth of PFR68 inoculated A. tricolor has found to have enhanced growth parameters such as leaf number (1.57 fold), root number (1.76 fold), shoot length (1.28 fold) and fresh weight (2.31 fold). The treatment also improved soil fertility in terms of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium content. Most remarkably, application of PFR68 alone and 50% of recommended NPK dose along with PFR68 has resulted in enhanced growth of A. tricolor comparable to plants treated with full dose of NPK. In addition to this, application of PFR68 along with 50% NPK augmented the available Nitrogen and Phosphorus content in soil. This indicates the potential of selected organism in enrichment of soil health and enhancement of crop productivity. In conclusion, field performance of PFR68 on growth of A. tricolor confirms its promises to develop into plant probiotic formulation.'

Abstract: 'Mosquito vectors are responsible for the transmission of parasitic and viral infections, including loss in commercial and labor outputs, particularly in developing countries with tropical and subtropical climates. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the adulticidal and smoke toxicity of Cipadessa baccifera (Roth) against three important mosquitoes vectors, Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae). Adult mortality was observed after 24-h recovery period. The plant crude extracts showed dose-dependent mortality. At higher concentrations, the adult showed restless movement for some times with abnormal wagging and then died. Among the extracts tested, the highest adulticidal activity was observed in acetone extract against An. stephensi followed by Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus with the LD50 and LD90 values 16.021 (14.080\xe2\x80\x9318.345), 29.095 (25.118\xe2\x80\x9334.089); 23.581 (22.100\xe2\x80\x9328.315), 38.636 (35.321\xe2\x80\x9341.021); and 13.560 (9.479\xe2\x80\x9317.391), 248.35 (203.47\xe2\x80\x93344.43) mg/ml, respectively. No mortality was recorded in the control. Smoke toxicity was observed at 10-min interval for 40\xc2\xa0min and the mortality data were recorded. Among the C. baccifera plant powder tested. Smoke toxicity results show that Cx. quinquefasciatus, An. stephensi, and Ae. aegypti shows 88.6\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.8, 78.2\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.5, and 77\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891, respectively. One hundred percent mortality was recorded in the commercial mosquito control. The present study shows that C. baccifera leaf powder can be used as an efficient toxicity against mosquitoes. These results suggest that the leaf extracts of C. baccifera have a potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of mosquitoes.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests are well known to have great species diversity and contribute substantial share in terrestrial carbon (C) stocks worldwide. Shrubs are long-neglected life form in the forest ecosystem, playing many roles in the forest and human life. Shrub has great impact on vegetation attributes which in turn modify the C storage and capture. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore the dynamics of shrub species in four fire regimes, viz. high, medium, low, and no fire zones of Bhoramdeo Wildlife Sanctuary of Kawardha forest division (Chhattisgarh), India. The variations in structure, diversity, biomass, productivity, and C sequestration potential in all the sites were quantified. The density and basal area of shrub varied from 1250 to 3750 individuals ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 2.79 to 4.92\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. The diversity indices showed that the value of Shannon index was highest in medium fire zone (3.77) followed by high, low, and no fire zones as 3.25, 3.12, and 2.32, respectively. The value of Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s index or concentration of dominance (Cd) ranged from 0.08 to 0.20, species richness from 0.56 to 1.58, equitability from 1.41 to 1.44, and beta diversity from 1.50 to 4.20, respectively. The total biomass and C storage ranged from 6.82 to 15.71 and from 2.93 to 6.76\xc2\xa0t ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. The shrub density, importance value index (IVI), and abundance to frequency ratio (A/F) significantly correlated between high fire and medium fire zone. The basal area was found to be significantly positively correlated between high fire and medium fire, and low and no fire zones, respectively. Two-way cluster analysis reflected various patterns of clustering due to influence of the forest fire which showed that some species have distant clustering while some have smaller cluster. Principal component analysis (PCA) reflects variable scenario with respect to shrub layer. Ventilago calyculata and Zizyphus rotundifolia showed higher correlation between themselves in terms of basal area (BA). The total shrub production was 1.59\xe2\x80\x933.53\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 while the C sequestration potential of 0.71\xe2\x80\x931.57\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 under different fire regimes. Shrub community in the medium fire zone reflected higher productivity and higher C sequestration in comparison to other fire zone. Among the different plant parts, the biomass accumulation ratio was highest in the root of shrub community among various fire regimes. Screening of species for restoration and different land-use pattern on the basis of biomass accumulation and carbon sequestering potential would be an effective strategy for decision-making in sustainable forest management.'

Abstract: 'How water should be managed in Monsoon Asia is emerging as one of the core earth system governance challenges. In this article, we explore the politics around pursuits of adaptiveness in water management, emphasizing the major transboundary river basins draining the south and eastern Himalayas. We look at two main functions: storing, diverting and sharing water for periods of scarcity; protecting people and places from destructive floods. We find that the pursuit of adaptiveness will take place partly outside the range of human experience in a context of large differences in exposure and vulnerabilities, disparate interests and unequal power. Anticipatory policies and actions to adapt and improve adaptive capacity to the transboundary impacts of changes in water-use, land-use and climate on water resources and services are still in their infancy; but several problem-framing discourses are emerging that have longer-term implications for water governance. It is not yet clear how these competing policy-frames will evolve in Asia. Much will depend on how systems of water governance develop. Public scrutiny of how governments in Asia plan to adapt to climate change in the water sector\xe2\x80\x94on how risks of not enough and too much water are dealt with\xe2\x80\x94will need to continue to help sort out those projects and strategies which are driven primarily by political benefits from those which actually contribute to building adaptive capacities and maintaining social-ecological resilience.'

Abstract: 'The current anthropogenic activities and climate change are increasingly becoming a growing global concern for dry tropical forests. Worldwide, these ecologically important forests have degraded considerably since the past few decades due to such factors. These factors have harmful consequences on the vegetation structure and diversity especially tree seedlings, which may further aggravate climate change. Generally, the vegetation recovery is very slow and unpredictable in the dry tropics due to complex interaction among tree seedling, site (particularly, soil) and climatic conditions. We inculcated that a better understanding of the behavior of individuals of different tree species at seedling stage in dry forests is of immense importance. It is increasingly being recognized for explaining and managing the future composition of plant communities under changing environmental conditions. In this regard, the multi-factorial interaction studies under various resource\xe2\x80\x93disturbance combinations are needed in dry tropical ecosystems to understand the: (1) impact of relative variability in resources and disturbances on the responses of tree seedlings of native species and (2) how the later relates to distinct functional and life history traits of the individual tree species. Most importantly, such studies would improve our limited understanding of how variation (natural and man-made) in nutrient availability, under the influence of other local environmental factors (such as water, light, grass competition, herbivory, fire, allelopathy and enhanced CO2 conditions), would affect the dynamics of dry tropical forest community. It may help in the proper management of these forests. Moreover, it may prove helpful in the current climate change scenario, as change in forest community dynamics may have consequences on soil C sequestration and CO2 efflux at global scale.'

Abstract: 'Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophyte (DSE) colonization were investigated in three different plantation sites (Umdihar, Umsaw and Mawlein) of Meghalaya, northeast India. Isolation and identification of the AMF spore were conducted to evaluate the AMF diversity and host preference in terms of AMF species distribution and abundance in the plantation sites. Results showed that AMF colonization was significantly higher than dark septate endophyte colonization (p>0.05). AMF and DSE colonization had a narrow range of colonization, varying from 50.91%\xe2\x80\x9358.95% and 1.84%\xe2\x80\x934.11%, respectively. Spore density varied significantly in all the sites (p>0.05). Out of 29 species identified from 7 genera, the species from Glomus was found to be highly abundant. Sorenson coefficient (Cs) ranged from 0.35\xe2\x80\x937.0. Species richness varied from 2.0\xe2\x80\x932.9 in the sites. Total species richness was significantly correlated with total relative abundance (p=0.001). The distribution, abundance and principal component analysis plot suggest that Glomus macrocarpum, G. multicaulis, G. constrictum and Acaulospora sp 1 were the most host preferred species which possibly may favour the host with proper nutrient acquisition and growth.'

Abstract: 'Frequent burning and grazing and cultivation of cash crops increasingly threaten forest patches in hilly grassland in Northeast Luzon, yet their importance as a resource with multiple environmental functions and forest products persists. The aim of this study is to identify different types of forest patches, and their condition under present land-use intensification, and discuss prospects for their integration into sustainable local farming systems. Five types of forest patches are distinguished, both natural and planted ones, including rows of trees, woody patches, gallery forests, hill-slope forests and homegarden conglomerations. Natural woody patches and gallery forests in Imperata grassland are subject to degradation and land-use conversion under conditions of agricultural intensification. Woody patches in grassland affected by frequent burning and grazing cover small areas (66% below 50 m2 as opposed to 28% in protected grassland) and contain relatively few woody plant species (25 woody species in total as opposed to 82 where protected). Yet where well managed, they may provide a variety of products for sale and subsistence, covering emergency needs and giving off-season cash income to rural communities. Moreover they serve like the gallery forest various ecological functions, carrying valuable indigenous tree species, retaining soil base nutrients, providing a continuous supply of organic matter and intercepting fine earth soil particles removed from bare surfaces. It is suggested that forest-patch management systems may be developed, taking into account both patch diversity and the diverse needs of rural communities, and to strengthen existing and undervalued functions of forest patches as permanent elements in an agricultural landscape.'

Abstract: 'Multiple actinomycete strains were isolated from two ant species, Lasius niger and Formica cunicularia, and their phenotypic properties and phylogenetic position were studied. Partial sequencing of 16S rRNA assigned the greater part of them to the genus Streptomyces, but only one belonged to Nocardia. However, some isolates had significant color and morphological differences from their closest phylogenetic relatives. The abundance and biodiversity of actinomycete communities isolated from L. niger ants greatly exceeded those found for F. cunicularia. All of the actinomycetes associated with F. cunicularia ants demonstrated cellulolytic activity, but only one had such ability among the strains associated with black ants.'

Abstract: 'The genus Piper is well known for their medicinal and economic potentials and is distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Majority of the taxa under the genus Piper are morphologically confusing because of the wide range of variations within the vegetative characters. A total of 22 morphological characters, including both vegetative and reproductive characters were studied at a mature stage in 35 accessions of Piper taxa collected from North East India representing 12 species. The morphometric variables were analyzed using variance and Principal Component Analysis. It was carried out to identify the useful characters that can contribute to distinguish various species. The Unweighted Pair Group Method and Arithmetic Average clustering method for the vegetative traits and reproductive traits show two principal clusters. The present study revealed the importance of the morphological characters in delimitation of taxonomic grouping of the confusing species.'

Abstract: 'Homegardens are recognized worldwide as sustainable agroforestry systems that are repositories of species and genetic diversity. Species diversity and composition of homegardens are influenced by a number of environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural factors. The present study examines the tree species diversity in the homegardens of different cultural groups of Barak Valley, Assam, Northeast India. Complete enumeration was done for diversity analysis in 181 homegardens from 38 villages in the three districts of the Valley. Factors affecting plant diversity were analyzed, and the floristic composition of the homegardens was found to vary with garden size, ethnicity of the homegarden owners, and geographical parameters such as location and altitude. Results indicate high plant diversity, with a total of 161 tree species identified from 47 families. Tea garden labor communities were comparatively found to hold more diversity in their homegardens. Similarity and cluster analysis revealed the distinctness of the majority of the homegardens, and seven groups of homegardens with very low distance were revealed. Homegardens were also found to maintain considerable conservation value as repositories of many underutilized, wild, and rare plant species. Biodiversity conservation in the homegardens was found to be linked to the multiple values of the different plant species to the homegardeners and further highlight the concept of the \xe2\x80\x9cconservation through use\xe2\x80\x9d approach. For the preservation of such traditional agroforestry systems, which also have the potential to provide options for adaptation to climate change, proper documentation of traditional knowledge concerning the different plant species and the human-nature interaction in the homegardens is necessary before such systems are completely lost.'

Abstract: 'Understanding the negative impact of a variety of environmental contaminants on aquatic animals is essential to curb biodiversity loss and stop degradation of ecological functions. Excessive and unrestricted use of pesticides is the most serious threat to aquatic animals including amphibians and fishes. Among the known pesticides, glyphosate based formulations have been shown to have lethal effects on many aquatic organisms. However, negative effects of pesticides on crucial ecological interactions such as prey-predator interactions are relatively unknown from tropics. In many aquatic organisms, recognition of predators is based on odor signatures; and therefore any anthropogenic alteration in water chemistry has the potential to impair recognition and learning of predators. Through a series of behavioral experiments we evaluated the effect of glyphosate based herbicide (Roundup\xc2\xae) on the antipredator behavior of common spiny loach, Lepidocephalichthys thermalis to understand the effects of pesticide-exposure on recognition of conspecific alarm cues, and associative learning to avoid predation. We exposed common spiny loach (for 3\xe2\x80\x89h or 15 days) to sub-lethal concentration (0.5\xe2\x80\x89mg a.e./L) of Roundup\xc2\xae and subsequently with conspecific alarm cues, signaling the proximity of a predator. Unexposed prey fish showed a significant reduction in activity level in response to conspecific alarm cues. Whereas such alarm response was not observed in prey fish that were exposed to Roundup\xc2\xae either for 3\xe2\x80\x89h or 15 days. Such lack of response could be associated with alteration of olfactory function in prey individuals. However, this inability to detect the conspecific alarm cues was found to be transient and exposed fish recovered within 2 days. In subsequent experiments, we showed that Roundup\xc2\xae deactivates the conspecific alarm cues thus making them unavailable for prey to evoke the response. Furthermore, Roundup\xc2\xae mediated degradation of conspecific alarm cues and diminished the associative learning necessary for detection of the invasive/unknown/novel predators. Overall, due to the worldwide occurrence of glyphosate in water bodies, glyphosate mediated behavioral suppression exposes the prey animals to a considerable risk of predation, both by native and non-native predators.'

Abstract: 'To analyze the relationship between the management of three forest stand plantations and soil quality in the Dimapur district of the Northeastern Himalayan region, India, three forest soil profiles, covered by different species stands, at three depths were tested for 13 physical and chemical variables. Only four of these variables (electric conductivity, bulk density exchangeable Mg and available P) were included in a minimum data set, after using a varimax rotation algorithm in a principal component analysis, and subsequently used to calculate a soil quality index (SQI). Results showed higher SQIs in the surface layers (0\xe2\x80\x9320\xc2\xa0cm depth) than in the deeper ones. Average weighed SQI varied significantly (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05) through the three considered forest sites, with the lowest value at site FS3. These findings reveal that the approach used here is suitable for preliminary screening of the impact of a forestry species on soil, to aid in species selection and improve soil health for afforestation and reforestation projects.'

Abstract: 'A critical first step in establishing biosphere reserves\xe2\x80\x94under the Man and Biosphere Programme of UNESCO\xe2\x80\x94is to generate baseline information for future courses of action. The present study aims to assess the structure and composition of forests\xe2\x80\x94along with anthropogenic pressures mounting on these forests in the buffer zone of one such biosphere reserves\xe2\x80\x94the Pachmarhi biosphere reserve of India. The quadrat method was employed for sampling vegetation, and information on anthropogenic pressures was collected by conducting interviews with local people and forest officials and collecting it from secondary sources. A total of 39 tree species were sampled in 82 quadrats; of these 26 tree species were in standing stage, 25 in sapling, and 35 in seedling. Chloroxylon swietenia emerged as the most dominant tree species having highest importance value index, followed by Tectona grandis, Terminalia tomentosa, and Hardwickia binata. Nine tree species and their saplings, including Sterculia urens and Terminalia arjuna, were exploited so badly that they were only found in the seedlings stage. The unavailability of standing trees of 12 important tree species including Aegle marmelos and Phyllanthus emblica indicates the intensity and gravity of anthropogenic pressures on these important tree species. If the present anthropogenic pressure continues, which has inhibited the regeneration of several tree species, then substantial negative ecological and societal consequences can be expected.'

Abstract: 'Concomitant with careless human interference in the delicate environmental balance, the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface is witnessing a variety of changes in land use and land cover (LULC). Acquisition of a sound understanding of LULC is an important aspect of maintaining a sustainable, benign, healthy environment. The present work highlights a spatiotemporal study on the LULC features of Alappuzha District, an ecologically fragile area in southern Kerala, a state in South India. The study area faces diverse environmental challenges including decline of landforms, rising sea levels, population expansion and anthropogenic encroachments on the ecological balance. This investigation compiles an audited account of the modifications, in each class of LULC, using geospatial technologies. We interpreted satellite imagery from the Landsat 8 and the Landsat multispectral scanner for the years 1973 and 2017. The LULC aspects were categorized into seven classes: waterbody, waterlogged area, mixed vegetation, built-up land, uncultivated area, paddy field and sandy area. Our findings affirm that the expansiveness of the built-up land area is directly proportional to the growth of the population. Advanced technologies such as remote sensing and geographic information system accentuate alterations in land use patterns over time and the extent to which the changes affect the human population and the natural habitat. We verified the results of our research by assessment of accuracy and ground truth confirmation of the LULC features.'

Abstract: 'The species of Ganoderma recorded from India as causing diseases of perennial crops are listed, and their host range and taxonomy discussed. Four new hosts of G. lucidum are also reported. A decline in productivity and the death of trees are the main economic impacts due to Ganoderma diseases, and the fungus is identified as a serious pathogen of cash crops, forest plantations and trees in natural forests in the country. Ganoderma diseases have been recorded on 144 hosts in India, the major pathogens being \tG. lucidum and G. applanatum. G. lucidum has been recorded on 91 hosts, and appears to cause the most widespread diseases. Identification has largely been made from morphological and cultural characters, and the names currently in use should therefore be treated with caution. Cultural methods of disease control are largely inefficient in minimising inoculum pressure and in reducing the disease incidence. Chemical methods in combination with soil amendments form short-term solutions for managing the disease and improving productivity. The immediate priorities for developing an efficient management system for Ganoderma diseases in India are: (1) a thorough understanding of the etiology and epidemiology of the diseases on different hosts, (2) clarifying current ambiguity in species names, (3) assessing the inter-relationships between populations of Ganoderma on different hosts and (4) developing tools for early detection of diseases in important crops.'

Abstract: 'In the present communication habitat ecology, species diversity; distribution and different indices of fish biodiversity management were studied in a Central India river (River Betwa, a tributary of River Ganga basin approved under India\xe2\x80\x99s first river linking plan). Correlation between fish species richness with the hydrological attributes showed good relationship and water depth, dissolved oxygen and pH were found the most important variables in shaping fish assemblage. Altogether, sixty-three fish species belonging to 20 families and 45 genera were collected from five sampling stations spread along the upstream, mid stream and lower streams. Cyprinids were the most dominated group represented by 26 species belonging to 15 genera, followed by Bagridae (6 species from 3 genera), and Schilbeidae (4 species from 4 genera). The distribution of fish showed interesting pattern and about 10% species were common to all the sites showing long migration range. Shannon-Weiner diversity index showed considerable variation and ranged from 1.89 to 3.51. Out of 63 species status of 10 species were not known due to data deficit, 29 categorized as lower risk, 14 as vulnerable, 8 as endangered, while the remaining two species were introduced. Our study shows that the River supports considerable diversity of the fishes and is important for conservation and about 34% fish fauna is threatened being either vulnerable or endangered. We assessed that the river supports considerable percentage of food fish (89.47), ornamental fish (49.12%) and sport fish (5.26%). Among the eight major types of fish habitats identified along the entire stretch of river, open river, shallow water and deep pools were habitats contributing maximum diversity. Fish species richness (FSR) were significantly different (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) in all the habitats except channel confluence and scour pool. Trophic niche model may be useful for assessing altered as well as less altered fish habitat of the tropical rivers. Since this river will be interlinked in near future, this study would be useful for conservation planning and management and also for future assessment after interlinking. Issues related to various threats to aquatic environment and conservation management strategies have been discussed.'

Abstract: 'Cryptic species are difficult to identify using morphological identification tools. They represent hitherto unknown biodiversity and their discovery helps formulate more efficient conservation management policies. In this study we assess intraspecific diversity of Rhinolophus rouxii and investigate the presence of cryptic lineages. We characterize acoustic, morphological and genetic differences between allopatric populations of this species in Southern India. Our results reveal the presence of two distinct acoustic lineages (80 and 90\xc2\xa0kHz phonic types). Forearm length also differs significantly between the two phonic types. They share a sister taxa relationship and the average genetic distance between them is over 8 %. Phylogenetic reconstruction and the associated divergence time suggest an evolutionary history that correlates with a middle Miocene separation. We propose that these two phonic types be called sibling species and evolutionarily significant units (ESU) within the subgenus Indorhinolophus. We recommend a new name, R. indorouxii for the species representing the 90\xc2\xa0kHz phonic type. This study reiterates our lack of accurate taxonomic knowledge of bats, and highlights the value in combining genetics with behavioral (phonic characterization) and morphological measurements in the discovery of cryptic species.'

Title: 'Geographic distribution patterns of small mammals in Swaziland in relation to abiotic factors and human land-use activity'

Abstract: 'Swaziland is a small, topographically diverse southern Africa country whose mammalian fauna has been poorly studied. The distributions of small mammals in Swaziland were surveyed at 39 localities. A total of 15 species of rodents and ten species of insectivores were captured during the survey. The number of species of insectivore captured at a locality was positively correlated with mean annual rainfall, while the number of rodent species captured was negatively correlated with altitude. The number of rodent species captured was lower on Swazi Nation Land compared with privately owned land or protected land (reserves). This was probably due to the radical habitat alteration that had taken place on Swazi Nation Land, inter alia overgrazing by livestock, cultivation of maize and deforestation. The effect of this habitat alteration on the number of rodent species was more pronounced in high-lying areas of Swaziland. This may have been due to the fact that a large number of the rodent species inhabiting high-lying areas require thick, tall grassland habitats, whereas many of the low-lying species prefer more open habitats with less grass cover. Since grazing acts to reduce grass cover, it is suggested that the species inhabiting high-lying areas would be more affected by overgrazing, than low-lying species.'

Abstract: 'The present study was conducted on the floristic composition, structure, diversity and biomass of understorey vegetation in the dry tropical forest of Achanakmaar Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve (AABR) of India using phyto-sociological analysis in each forest type by randomly laying ten sample plots of 1\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x891\xc2\xa0m size. The herbs were enumerated for their girth and height in sampling plots. The structure, diversity and biomass of herb communities were analyzed at forest type level and the study found 2919 plant individuals belonging to 66 species, 62 genera and 31 families. The most important family as determined by the Family Importance Value (FIV) was Poaceae in herbs layer. In terms of Importance Value Index (IVI), the herb Arthraxon hispidus (Poaceae) was the most vital species in the herbaceous community. The present study revealed that the density of herbaceous community ranged from 0.40 to 244.80\xc2\xa0herbs\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in various forest types, Basal area was recorded highest in Sal mixed forest (0.00373\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) and lowest was found in Bamboo forest (0.00188\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921). The number of species in different forests varied from 14 to 32. Similarly, the Shannon index values in different forest types varied from 2.18 to 3.64, Simpson index values ranged from 0.045 to 0.17, the values of species richness from 16.69 to 30.52 and species evenness ranged from 0.81 to 0.95 in herb vegetation of different forest types. Shannon index values recorded in Sal mixed forest and Bamboo forest were found to be minimum. In contrary, Bamboo forest recorded maximum dominance of species as compared to other forests. Interestingly, beta diversity values ranged from 3.12 to 7.36 and it was observed to be highest in Bamboo forest and lowest in Sal mixed forest. However, the total herbaceous biomass varied from 86.28\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 to 321\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922. The study recommends adopting intensive conservation measures especially in the open mixed forest and immature Teak plantations. In addition to it, encouraging and improving sal regeneration in sal mixed forests will not only help in reducing the biotic pressure but also in restoring and conserving the fragile dry tropical forest ecosystems of India.'

Abstract: 'With the exception of Cajanus cajan (L.) Millspaugh (pigeonpea), the remaining species of genus Cajanus have not been domesticated. For millennia these taxa have persisted in natural habitats through self-sown seeds. These wild species are an asset for sustaining future pigeonpea breeding programmes since they contain certain traits (genes) that are necessary for encountering various breeding challenges related to crop improvement and adaptation. In this review we identify the key traits from wild Cajanus species, and discuss various physical and genetic constraints encountered in their utilization in introgression breeding. Some noteworthy achievements recorded from inter-specific breeding programmes in pigeonpea are also discussed. These include the development of (1) high protein (>\xe2\x80\x8928%) genotypes (2) cytoplasmic nuclear male sterility systems (3) highly (>\xe2\x80\x8995%) self-pollinating genotypes, and (4) resistance sources to sterility mosaic disease, nematodes, salinity, photo-insensitivity, pod borers, podfly, bruchids, and Phytophthora blight. To help pigeonpea breeders engaged in inter-specific breeding programmes, we suggest the division of the secondary gene pool germplasm into two sub-group/tiers on the basis of ease in hybridization.'

Abstract: 'Agrobiodiversity is an evident outcome of a long-lasting human\xe2\x80\x93nature relationship, as the continuous use, conservation and management of crops has resulted in biological as well as cultural diversity of seeds and breeds. This paper aims to understand the interlocking of formal and informal seed supply routes by considering the dynamic flow of seeds within networks across the intersections of gender, ethnicity and age in South India as social categories structuring human\xe2\x80\x93nature relations. This changing relationship under formal and informal institutional settings has consequences on performance for men and women in rice seed systems. Undertaking an empirical analysis of the organization of seed management and exchange, we seek to shed light on the gendered organization of agrobiodiversity as a social network. The study builds on Net-Map interviews conducted in 2012, embedded in the larger BioDIVA project in the district of Wayanad in Kerala, India. Based on network analysis, the interactive method employed has enabled identification of important actors in the seed system and the characteristics of their relationships. We look into the gendered structure of information exchange regarding seed varieties and actual seed transactions, while also examining clusters of actors collaborating regarding seed supply. Finally, we identify the institutional gap concerning seed sources left by formal and informal institutions, like the availability of varieties. We show how informal and formal seed systems coexist and overlap due to actors moving between systems and argue that the degree and areas of overlap are shaped by gendered human\xe2\x80\x93nature relations.'

Abstract: 'Eleven species of Inocybe, a highly diverse genus of ectomycorrhizal Agaricales, are documented from tropical India in Kerala State. Seven species are described as new. Furthermore, I. pileosulcata is reported from India for the first time. I. virosa, not previously validated, is validated here. Gross morphological and microscopic descriptions, illustrations, and phylogenetic affiliations are provided. Seven species feature nodulose or spinose basidiospores and belong to the Inocybe clade. The remaining four species are characterized by the combination of smooth spores and absence of pleurocystidia. Two of these share an alliance with the Pseudosperma clade, and the other two with the Inosperma clade. All 11 species likely share an ecological association with lowland tropical Dipterocarpaceae. The new combination I. mucidiolens is made (formerly I. calamistrata var. mucidiolens).'

Abstract: 'Quantification of fruit fall is the only way to compare fruit food availability among different studies. This study aims to reveal the general characteristics of fruit fall in temperate forests, which should offer indispensable information for using fruit fall data as food availability for frugivores. Fruit fall in three warm-temperate and two cool-temperate forests on Yakushima, an island in southwestern Japan, were studied for two years in one cool-temperate plot of 50 m \xc3\x97 50 m in size and for four years in other plots of 100 m \xc3\x97 50 m in size. The elevations of the plots ranged 170\xe2\x80\x931200 m a.s.l. Fruit fall was highest in the lowland forests (599 and 564 DW kg\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xb7year\xe2\x88\x921 and lowest in the mid-elevation forest (198 DW kg\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xb7year\xe2\x88\x921). Fleshy fruits and food-fruits for Japanese macaques constituted 3\xe2\x80\x9337% and 4\xe2\x80\x9387% of the total fruit fall, respectively. When only fleshy-fruit fall was compared, it was higher in the western lowland forest (222 DW kg\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xb7year\xe2\x88\x921) than in any other forests (9\xe2\x80\x9366 DW kg\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xb7year\xe2\x88\x921). The pulp of fleshy fruits, presumably the edible parts for frugivores, was only 1.1\xe2\x80\x9312.7% of the total fruit fall. The edible parts for Japanese macaques constituted 3\xe2\x80\x9354% of the fruit fall, showing a high value where acorns are abundant. Half of the fruit-fall biomass consisted of only one or two nonfleshy-fruited species, which are usually dominant in many other temperate forests, such as Quercus and conifers. These variations agreed with the variations in occurrence of frugivorous (such as Japanese macaques).'

Title: 'Historical biogeography resolves the origins of endemic Arabian toad lineages (Anura: Bufonidae): Evidence for ancient vicariance and dispersal events with the Horn of Africa and South Asia'

Abstract: 'The Arabian Peninsula is home to a unique fauna that has assembled and evolved throughout the course of major geophysical events, including the separation of the Arabian Plate from Africa and subsequent collision with Eurasia. Opportunities for faunal exchanges with particular continents occurred in temporally distinct periods, and the presence of African, Western Eurasian, and South Asian derived taxa on the Arabian Peninsula signifies the complexity of these historical biogeographic events. The six true toad species (family Bufonidae) endemic to the Arabian Peninsula present a considerable taxonomic and biogeographic challenge because they are part of a global bufonid radiation, including several genera surrounding the Arabian Peninsula, and difficult to discriminate morphologically. As they could be derived from African, Western Eurasian, or South Asian toad groups, elucidating their evolutionary relationships has important implications for historical biogeography. Here, we analyze a global molecular data set of 243 bufonid lineages, with an emphasis on new sampling from the Horn of Africa, Western Eurasia, South Asia, and the Arabian Peninsula, to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of the Arabian species. We produce a robust time-calibrated phylogeny to infer the biogeographic history of this group on and around the Arabian Peninsula.'

Abstract: 'Most of the mountainous regions in tropical humid climatic zone experience severe soil loss due to natural factors. In the absence of measured data, modeling techniques play a crucial role for quantitative estimation of soil loss in such regions. The objective of this research work is to estimate soil loss and prioritize the sub-watersheds of Kali River basin using Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. Various thematic layers of RUSLE factors such as rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), topographic factor (LS), crop management factor (C), and support practice factor (P) have been prepared by using multiple spatial and non-spatial data sets. These layers are integrated in geographic information system (GIS) environment and estimated the soil loss. The results show that \xe2\x88\xbc42\xc2\xa0% of the study area falls under low erosion risk and only 6.97\xc2\xa0% area suffer from very high erosion risk. Based on the rate of soil loss, 165 sub-watersheds have been prioritized into four categories\xe2\x80\x94very high, high, moderate, and low erosion risk. Anthropogenic activities such as deforestation, construction of dams, and rapid urbanization are the main reasons for high rate of soil loss in the study area. The soil erosion rate and prioritization maps help in implementation of a proper watershed management plan for the river basin.'

Title: 'How global climate change and regional disturbance can expand the invasion risk? Case study of Lantana camara invasion in the Himalaya'

Abstract: 'Presently, it is debated if regional conservation efforts can alone resolve the ecological problems that global climatic changes could bring. Biological invasion is one of such concerns. In the present study, we modeled how change in global climate and regional anthropogenic pressure can impact the distribution of invasive Lantana camara in the Upper Ganga valley of the Western Himalaya (India). The forest in the study area was stratified into 1\xc2\xa0km2 grid and two 15\xc2\xa0m radius plot were located in each of the forest types in the grid, for recording Lantana presence. In total, 2221 plots were sampled covering 22% of forest. We used predictors representing the climate, forest patch size, fire and natural disaster variables for modeling the species distribution using maximum entropy algorithm. We further simulated 12 future landscape scenarios based on the global trends of these parameters. The present species\xe2\x80\x94environment relationship was projected to these future landscape scenarios. Lantana was presently estimated to spread in 231\xc2\xa0km2 of the study area. It invaded larger forest patches in the sub-tropical region, and smaller disturbed forest patches in the warm and cold temperate region. Increased distribution of Lantana was projected across all the future scenarios. The study revealed how global climate changes and regional anthropogenic pressure can have a synergistic effect on the expansion of invasive species in the future. It thus questions the efficiency of conducting only regional efforts in absence of global initiative to reduce the greenhouse gases emission.'

Abstract: 'Bacterial diversity of soil samples collected from different geographical regions of Himalayan mountains was studied through culturable (13 samples) and culture-independent approaches (5 samples based on abundance of diversity indices in each ecological niche). Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Wiener diversity index and total bacterial count ranged from 1.50\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.1 to 2.57\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.15 and 7.8\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.6\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89105 to 30.9\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.7\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89105\xc2\xa0cfu\xc2\xa0ml\xe2\x88\x921 of soil, respectively. Based on morphology and pigmentation, 406 isolates were selected by culturing in different cultivable media at various strengths and concentrations. All the strains were subjected to amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis and the representative isolates from each cluster were chosen for 16S rRNA gene sequence-based identification. Soil habitat in Himalayan foot hills was dominated by the genera Arthrobacter, Exiguobacterium, Bacillus, Cedecea, Erwinia, and Pseudomonas. Five 16S rRNA gene libraries from the selected five samples yielded 268 clones and were grouped into 53 phylotypes covering 25 genera including the genus of Ferribacterium, Rothia, and Wautersiella, which were reported for the first time in Himalayan tracks. Principal coordinates analysis indicates that all the clone libraries were clearly separated and found to be significantly different from each other. Further, extracellular investigation of cold-active enzymes showed activity of cellulase (23.71\xc2\xa0%), pectinase (20.24\xc2\xa0%), amylase (17.32\xc2\xa0%), phytase (13.87\xc2\xa0%), protease (12.72\xc2\xa0%), and lipase (23.71\xc2\xa0%) among the isolates. Four isolates namely Exiguobacterium mexicanum (BSa14), Exiguobacterium sibiricum (BZa11), Micrococcus antarcticus (BSb10), and Bacillus simplex (BZb3) showed multiple enzyme activity for five different types of enzymes. In addition, various genera like Exiguobacterium, Erwinia, Mycetecola, Cedecea, Pantoea, and Trichococcus have also shown novel hydrolytic enzyme activity in the Himalayan foothills.'

Abstract: 'The mahseers are an important group of fishes endemic to Asia with most species considered threatened. Conservation plans to save declining wild populations are hindered by unstable taxonomy, and detailed systematic review could form a solid platform for future management and conservation. D-loop and cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) mtDNA sequences were examined in nine mahseer species of Tor, Neolissochilus, and Naziritor. Pseudogenes amplified in a portion of the species limited the utility of the D-loop region. ABGD analysis, NJ, ML, and MP methods and genetic distance (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G) using COI data revealed concordant species delimiting patterns. The three genera were monophyletic, separated as distinct clades (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G 0.064 to 0.106), and Naziritor was flagged as a separate genus, distinct from Puntius (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G 0.196). Out of seven nominal species known for Tor cogeners from India, only five were recovered with mtDNA data (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G 0.000 to 0.037) and two species could not be distinguished with the molecular data set employed. Tor mosal, synonymized as Tor putitora, was rediscovered as a distinct species (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G 0.031) based on its type locality. Tor mussulah was confirmed as a separate species (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G 0.019 to 0.026). Two valid species, Tor macrolepis and T. mosal mahanadicus, were not distinct from T. putitora (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G 0.00). The high divergence with mtDNA data failed to validate T. mosal mahanadicus as a subspecies of T. mosal (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G 0.031). Morphological outliers discovered within the distribution range of Tor tor (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G 0.022 to 0.025) shared the same lineage with T. putitora (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G 0.002 to 0.005), indicating a new extended distribution of the Himalayan mahseer T. putitora in the rivers of the Indian central plateau. The findings indicate the need for integrating molecular and morphological tools for taxonomic revision of the Tor and Naziritor genera, so that taxa are precisely defined for accurate in situ and ex situ conservation decisions.'

Abstract: 'The comparative assessment of genetic diversity using allozymes, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and microsatellite markers was conducted in endemic and endangered yellow catfish (Horabagrus brachysoma) sampled from three locations in Western Ghats river systems of India. Among the three markers, microsatellites show more polymorphism, having 100% polymorphic loci, whereas allozymes show the least (56%). In RAPD, 60.5% of fragments were polymorphic. Observed heterozygosity and F ST values were very high in microsatellites, compared with the other markers. Microsatellite and RAPD markers reported a higher degree of genetic differentiation than allozymes among the populations depicted by pairwise F ST/G ST, AMOVA, Nei\xe2\x80\x99s genetic distance, and UPGMA dendrogram. The three classes of markers demonstrated striking genetic differentiation between pairs of H. brachysoma populations. The data emphasize the need for fishery management, conservation, and rehabilitation of this species.'

Abstract: 'The present investigation describes the in vitro propagation of Plectranthus bourneae via liquid culture system from axillary bud and shoot tip explants. Multiple shoots were initiated from axillary bud and shoot tip explants on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different concentrations (0.1\xe2\x80\x932.0\xc2\xa0mg/l) and combinations of cytokinins [BA (6-benzyladenine), KN (kinetin), and TDZ (thidizauron)] along with (0.5\xe2\x80\x932.0\xc2\xa0mg/l) auxins [NAA (\xce\xb1-naphthalene acetic acid), IAA (indole-3 acetic acid), IBA (indole-3-butyric acid)]. Maximum shoot multiplication (12.14) was achieved from axillary bud explant followed by shoot tip explant (8.85) at 0.5\xc2\xa0mg/l TDZ with 1.0\xc2\xa0mg/l NAA. A maximum of 9.71 roots/shoot was observed at 0.7\xc2\xa0mg/l IBA. The rooted plantlets successfully hardened and transferred to greenhouse condition with 83% survival. Inter-simple sequence repeat markers exhibited genetic fidelity with 100% monomorphism in regenerants. The authenticated protocol supports rapid production of true-to-type plants by liquid culture in vitro and therefore could supply a valuable target material for genetic transformation study.'

Abstract: 'Little is known about the patterns and correlates of mammal diversity gradients in Asia. In this study, we examine patterns of species distributions and phylogenetic diversity in Asia and investigate if the observed diversity patterns are associated with differences in diversification rates between the tropical and non-tropical regions. We used species distribution maps and phylogenetic trees to generate species and phylogenetic diversity measures for 1\xc2\xb0 \xc3\x97 1\xc2\xb0 cells across mainland Asia. We constructed lineage-through-time plots and estimated diversification shift-times to examine the temporal patterns of diversifications across orders. Finally, we tested if the observed gradients in Asia could be associated with geographical differences in diversification rates across the tropical and non-tropical biomes. We estimated speciation, extinction and dispersal rates across these two regions for mammals, both globally and for Asian mammals.'

Abstract: 'The genotypes of black pepper are morphologically and genotypically highly diverse and carry all the cumulative variations inherited and maintained through generations. The present study describes the Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) or microsatellite based assessment of genetic diversity among forty popular genotypes and four different species of black pepper in Southern region of India. For isolation of SSR primers, our earlier attempts with enrichment strategies like \xe2\x80\x98Triplex affinity capture\xe2\x80\x99 did not extract a single SSR primer due to close proximity of restriction sites to the SSR motif. Hence we developed a \xe2\x80\x98Sequential Reverse Genome Walking (SRGW)\xe2\x80\x99 strategy with better enrichment efficiency of 72% that generated seven new SSR primers. Genotyping precisely discriminated majority of genotypes which indicated that the SSR primers are very informative. A total of 62 alleles with an average of 15.5 alleles over 4 loci were identified. All the SSR primers showed an average Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) value of 0.85. The estimated average Shared Allele Frequency ranged between 1.57 and 20.12%. The PCA plot revealed four closely related individual groups and identified Karimunda, Wild pepper and a local landrace \xe2\x80\x98local b\xe2\x80\x99 as the most divergent genotypes. Cluster analysis exposed the genetic relatedness between hybrids and selections with other known cultivars. The introduction of black pepper from South India to Malaysia was emphasized from the observation of genetic similarity of Malaysian cultivar \xe2\x80\x98Kuching\xe2\x80\x99 with other indigenous popular cultivars. The study was first to portray the precise genetic relatedness among the major indigenous genotypes of black pepper.'

Abstract: 'Habitat loss and fragmentation are significant threats for primate species worldwide. However, few attempts have been made to look for general patterns in primate responses to habitat loss and fragmentation, or whether these may be associated with species\xe2\x80\x99 traits. We conducted a review of published literature on effects of patch size to quantify the effect of a reduction in this predictor on primates, and to determine whether these effects depend on species\xe2\x80\x99 traits. The effects of patch size on seven response variables (density, parasite prevalence and diversity, presence, genetic diversity, time spent feeding, resting and movement), were extracted from 135 papers and compared across six species traits (diet specialisation, social structure, body size, home range size, group size and dispersal ability). We found that density, parasitic prevalence and diversity and time spent feeding were positively associated with a reduction in patch size, while species\xe2\x80\x99 presence and genetic diversity were negatively associated. Time spent resting and moving did not show clear patterns. We found little evidence that the effect of patch size varies consistently with traits. This study provides important evidence for the consistent effect of patch size on a range of factors that influence the dynamics of primate populations. However, there is a need to move beyond quantifying patch size effects alone and to quantify the effects of changes occurring at broader landscape scales. This would allow more holistic primate conservation strategies to be developed across whole landscapes rather than being focussed on the management of individual patches.\n'

Abstract: 'The Indian subcontinent with Himalayan Mountains on northern side, Bay of Bengal on eastern side, Arabian Sea on the western side and Indian Ocean on the southern side presents a unique natural setting with highly variable climatic features. The seasonal variation in North India is highly pronounced whereas in southern India it is moderate, the coastal areas are influenced by cyclones, north western India dominated by western disturbances and desert conditions. Added to these natural influences the rapid urbanization of regions resulted in changing atmospheric conditions leading to sudden occurrence of natural calamities. Prediction of these events requires very reliable climatic models which is a gigantic task. To develop climatic models suitable to our country, huge reliable data base of atmospheric parameters is required. Keeping this objective in view the Radio and Atmospheric Sciences Division of National Physical Laboratory has been engaged in monitoring the atmospheric parameters using various facilities with focus on northern plains. The present paper describes the latest research activities using the existing facilities and future activities and facilities planned in this division.'

Abstract: 'This study was carried out to simulate the forest cover changes in India using Land Change Modeler. Classified multi-temporal long-term forest cover data was used to generate the forest covers of 1880 and 2025. The spatial data were overlaid with variables such as the proximity to roads, settlements, water bodies, elevation and slope to determine the relationship between forest cover change and explanatory variables. The predicted forest cover in 1880 indicates an area of 10,42,008 km2, which represents 31.7% of the geographical area of India. About 40% of the forest cover in India was lost during the time interval of 1880\xe2\x80\x932013. Ownership of majority of forest lands by non-governmental agencies and large scale shifting cultivation are responsible for higher deforestation rates in the Northeastern states. The six states of the Northeast (Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura) and one union territory (Andaman & Nicobar Islands) had shown an annual gross rate of deforestation of >0.3 from 2005 to 2013 and has been considered in the present study for the prediction of future forest cover in 2025. The modelling results predicted widespread deforestation in Northeast India and in Andaman & Nicobar Islands and hence is likely to affect the remaining forests significantly before 2025. The multi-layer perceptron neural network has predicted the forest cover for the period of 1880 and 2025 with a Kappa statistic of >0.70. The model predicted a further decrease of 2305 km2 of forest area in the Northeast and Andaman & Nicobar Islands by 2025. The majority of the protected areas are successful in the protection of the forest cover in the Northeast due to management practices, with the exception of Manas, Sonai-Rupai, Nameri and Marat Longri. The predicted forest cover scenario for the year 2025 would provide useful inputs for effective resource management and help in biodiversity conservation and for mitigating climate change.'

Abstract: 'Fires are a major disturbance to forest ecosystems and socioeconomic activities in Mazandaran province, northern Iran, particularly in the Hyrcanian forest sub-region. Mapping the spatial distribution of fire hazard levels and the most important influencing factors is crucial to enhance fire management strategies. In this research, MODIS hotspots were used to represent fire events covering Mazandaran Province over the period 2000\xe2\x80\x932016. We applied the ecological niche theory through the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) method to estimate fire hazard potential and the association with different anthropogenic and biophysical conditions, by applying different modeling approaches (heuristic, permutation, and jackknife metrics). Our results show that higher fire likelihood is related to density of settlements, distance to roads up to 3\xc2\xa0km and to land cover types associated with agricultural activities, indicating a strong influence of human activities in fire occurrence in the region. To decrease fire hazard, prevention activities related to population awareness and the adjustment of farming practices need to be considered.'

Abstract: 'Present studies on the community characteristics of earthworms revealed the occurrence of 11 species of earthworms in the pineapple (Ananus comosus) and 14 species in the mixed fruit plantations of west Tripura (India). While 9 species of earthworms namely Drawida assamensis, Drawida papillifer papillifer, Drawida nepalensis, Kanchuria sp., Metaphire houlleti, Eutyphoeus gigas, Eutyphoeus scutarius, Eutyphoeus comillahnus and Pontoscolex corethrurus are of common occurrence to both the pineapple and the mixed fruit plantations, two and five earthworm species namely Kanchuria sumerianus, Eutyphoeus sp. and Metaphire posthuma, Perionyx excavatus, Lampito mauritii, Amynthus alexandri, Eutyphoeus gammiei are restricted to the pineapple and the mixed fruit plantations respectively. Earthworms were found mostly within 15\xc2\xa0cm depth of soils having temperature 25\xe2\x80\x9325.8\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C, moisture 18.8\xe2\x80\x9322.4\xc2\xa0%, water holding capacity 26\xe2\x80\x9331.7\xc2\xa0% and organic matter content 2.4\xe2\x80\x934.0\xc2\xa0%. Mean earthworm densities (158\xc2\xa0ind.\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922) was significantly higher (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01, t\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa09.67) and biomass (36.67\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922) significantly lower (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01, t\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x925.98) in the pineapple plantation than the mixed fruit plantation (density 93\xc2\xa0ind.\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922, biomass 56\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922). High density value of earthworms in pineapple plantation is linked with dominance of D. assamensis and high biomass value in mixed fruit plantation was due to the higher relative abundance of larger species like E. gigas, E. scutarius, E. comillahnus and E. gammiei. Compared to the mixed fruit plantation, significantly (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) higher index of dominance, lower index of diversity, species richness index and species evenness were recorded in the pineapple plantation.'

Abstract: 'With the continuous increase in the population of developing countries and decline of natural resources, there is an urgent need to qualitatively and quantitatively augment crop productivity by using new tools and technologies for improvement of agriculturally important traits. The new scientific and technological omics-based approaches have enabled us to deal with several issues and challenges faced by modern agricultural system and provided us novel opportunities for ensuring food and nutritional security. Recent developments in sequencing techniques have made available huge amount of genomic and transcriptomic data on model and cultivated crop plants including Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Triticum aestivum etc. The sequencing data along with other data generated through several omics platforms have significantly influenced the disciplines of crop sciences. Gene discovery and expression profiling-based technologies are offering enormous opportunities to the scientific community which can now apply marker-assisted selection technology to assess and enhance diversity in their collected germplasm, introgress essential traits from new sources and investigate genes that control key traits of crop plants. Utilization of omics science and technologies for crop productivity, protection and management has recently been receiving a lot of attention; the majority of the efforts have been put into signifying the possible applications of various omics technologies in crop plant sciences. This article highlights the background of challenges and opportunities for augmentation of crop productivity through interventions of omics technologies in India.'

Abstract: 'Unmanaged and uncontrolled urbanisation has led to chaotic growth causing extensive fragmentation altering the local land use dynamics and the environment in and around many cities across the globe and has reached crucial thresholds. Quantifying these spatiotemporal urban growth patterns and visualisation is essential to understand the dynamics of urbanization and landscape dynamics. In this study, we use remotely sensed data to understand and visualise the urban growth patterns of Bangalore-Silicon hub of India. It has been stated that population growth and huge investments from the global markets are driving the change in land-use in Bangalore with the influx of population increased by 200% in the last decade. Considering this aspect in this study, Cellular Automata based model with the integration of socioeconomic factors was calibrated using historical urban growth extracted from classified data. This is used to forecast three scenarios of urban growth to 2020 with constraints as per the City Development Plan. Time series analysis of land use change exhibited an extensive outgrowth and urban sprawl in Bangalore: there has been leapfrog development in core regions of the city, whereas the buffer zones had ribbon development and cluster-based development. Urban sprawl was more along the major roads and places with better connectivity. Modelled land use results indicated an increase in the paved surface by 170% in the scenario, as usual, is considered. Because of models highly explicit nature of prediction, it was able to capture both linear and non-linear behaviour and a phase transition that happens in the urban landscape.'

Abstract: 'Wildlife poisoning is an important conservation threat for endangered species in India. There are no publications in the scientific literature that identify the specific poisons or chemicals involved in wildlife poisoning cases from the state of Kerala. In this report, all cases of wildlife mortality recorded between 2011 and 2013 at the office of the Assistant Forest Veterinary Officer, Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala were reviewed and cases where poisoning was considered as a differential diagnosis were identified. Specific poisons or chemicals were identified in three cases, while in a fourth, poisoning was determined to have occurred based on physical traces of the poison in gut contents. The poisons identified include carbofuran (a carbamate pesticide) in a bonnet macaque (Macaca radiata), warfarin (a rodenticide) in a mortality event involving four wild boars (Sus scrofa), endosulfan (an organochlorine pesticide) toxicity in a gaur (Bos gaurus) and imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid pesticide) toxicity in a wild adult Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). This communication thus reports for the first time on the specific chemical compounds identified in wildlife poisoning cases from Kerala state and argues for greater regulation of the sale and use of such toxic compounds in India.'

Abstract: 'Wayanad, one of the high range districts of the southernmost state of Kerala is a biodiversity hotspot region with rich endemic flora and fauna. It is well known for a wide variety of crops including specially scented rice, spices, ornamental plants, medicinal plants, subtropical fruits and vegetables. The district has been the home for majority of tribal population in Kerala. These tribal groups consume a large variety of wild leaves endemic to the area as a regular food supplement. Widely consumed leaves include those of Alternanthera sessilis, Talinum portulacifolium, Boerhaavia diffusa, Cassia tora, Colocasia esculenta, Achyranthes bidentata, Achyranranthus aspera, Alternanthera dentata, Amaranthus spinosus, Amaranthus viridis, Cyathula prostrata and Solanum nigrum. A comparison of the nutrient content of these non-domesticated leaves with amaranth (Amaranthus tricolor), the most commonly used leafy vegetable of Kerala has been attempted. Among all the WLVs studied, C. tora L. exhibited higher protein, fiber and vitamin C content than amaranth with significantly low nitrate and oxalate content. Different macro minerals like calcium, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and micro minerals like copper, zinc, iron and manganese were also found to be higher in most of these wild leafy vegetables as compared to those of amaranth. Since the wild leaves consumed by the tribal communities are rich in various nutrients especially the micro nutrients, attempts should be taken to conserve and promote these wild leaves for their sustainable utilization and to achieve nutritional security.'

Abstract: 'An examination of a syntype of Cuspidaria cochinensis Preston, 1916, focusing on the characters of the hinge, supports the transfer of this species to the family Corbulidae. Recently collected material from the Cochin Backwater is used to describe the shell and anatomy of the adult form. The ctenidia are composed of two demibranchs, both flat and homorhabdic, this further confirming that this species is eulamellibranch and not septibranch. The most appropriate generic placing of this species is in Cuneocorbula; thus, it is the first recorded extant species of the genus.'

Abstract: 'Traditional homegardens are an important component of the farming systems in many rural communities and have been highlighted considerably due to their sustainability and role in the conservation of biodiversity. However, the functional aspect of the homegardens, which includes the phenological behavior of the dominant tree species in such agroforestry systems, has been undermined till date, and there is a lack of adequate data on this aspect of the traditional homegardens. As a step in this direction the present study was carried out to determine the phenological behavior of important multipurpose trees in the homegardens of the village of Dargakona, Assam, northeast India. The study revealed the dominance of periodic growth deciduous species from a total of 25 tree species selected for phenological observation. The diversity of multipurpose trees in the homegardens is represented by different plant functional types with different phenological behavior which showed significant changes in their responses to inter-annual climatic variations. The diversity of tree species with different phenological behavior has implications for the temporal partitioning of resources, especially during periods of scarcity, thereby resulting in efficient utilization of resources such as water. Also the diverse phenological behavior plays an important role in regulating the food supply for the herbivore population and the year-round availability of products, and such information can be useful in the selection of species for integration into other agroforestry systems which can be sustainable in the long run.'

Abstract: 'Habitat degradation through agricultural land use is the major factor threatening lotic ecosystems. Although black flies are major components of these ecosystems, the impact of agricultural land use on species diversity and species assemblages has been largely ignored in tropical streams of the Oriental region. The objectives of this study are to examine patterns of species distribution and species richness and to compare black fly species richness and species assemblages in forest and agricultural streams in Thailand. A total of 143 collections were made from 70 stream sites between June 2007 and May 2008. Whereas 19 black fly species found in these collections were all found in forest sites, only 13 species were found in agricultural sites. High species richness was associated with larger, faster, and cooler streams with larger streambed particles and the presence of riparian trees. Logistic regression analyses revealed that stream size, velocity, and riparian vegetation are among the most important factors determining patterns of spatial distribution. The results are largely consistent with studies in other zoogeographic regions, suggesting the existence of general rules for black fly species distributions. Comparisons of the physicochemical conditions between forest and agricultural streams indicated that streams in agricultural areas are warmer, with higher conductivity and fewer riparian trees. Species richness was significantly higher in forest than in agricultural streams (t\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa03.61, P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001). Streams in forest areas were predominantly occupied by S. siamense (73%) but other species were also found at a relatively high frequency (>20%) of the sampling sites. In contrast, streams in agricultural areas were predominantly occupied by S. aureohirtum (>80%) among the sole black fly species at 27% of the sites. The results indicate that agricultural land use has a significantly detrimental impact on black fly diversity and species assemblages.'

Abstract: 'Our study examined the species composition and vegetative structure of traditional homegardens within the context of the surrounding land use mosaic typical of village lands in the southwest region of Sri Lanka. We conducted interviews and spatially mapped the land uses of a single traditional village comprising over thirty households. After mapping the different land uses for each household we selected ten households and conducted a census of the vegetation of their land use areas. Land use categories included homegarden, patio, rubber, tea plantation, and secondary forest and scrub. Land holdings varied in size between 0.18 and 1.34 hectares and comprised 39% tea land, 27% homegarden, 12% patio, 17% secondary forest and scrub land, and 4% rubber plantation. We identified a total of 268 plant species on the ten properties in a total of 216 genera and 84 families across all growth habits combined (trees, shrubs, herbs and climbers). Our results show three times the plant species richness in homegardens than for any similar research on tree gardens elsewhere, but a large proportion are exotic and almost all have some kind of utilitarian purpose. The top three tree species are palms in homegardens which represent over two-thirds of the stem density and half the basal area. The conservation activities within tree gardens emphasizes the crucial\xe2\x80\x94but perhaps undervalued\xe2\x80\x94role local livelihoods and land management activities play in retaining tree species diversity comparable but dramatically differing in taxa as compared to the original rain forest.'

Abstract: 'A comparative study of butterfly communities in 15 urban/suburban remnants of tropical semideciduous forest in Campinas (S\xc3\xa3o Paulo state, SE Brazil; 24\xc2\xb0S, 47\xc2\xb0W), with areas from 1.0 to 252\xe2\x80\x89ha and widely varying histories and environments, shows that the most significant factors, besides area and sampling time, distinguishing the sites and influencing their diversity (80\xe2\x80\x93702 species) and composition are connectivity, permanent water, vegetation, flowers, and human impact (negative, including pollution). The diversified Nymphalidae butterflies (38\xe2\x80\x93213 species) and especially two fermented-bait-attracted groups (Satyrinae, 2\xe2\x80\x9330 species, and Biblidini, 9\xe2\x80\x9344 species), are among the more useful indicators of the quality and diversity of the environments in these fragments. Effective conservation of butterfly communities in tropical cities may be achieved by maintenance of arboreal green corridors along streets and watercourses between moderately large (>10\xe2\x80\x89ha) humid areas, not near to the most built-up or polluted city centre(s), and the inclusion within these areas of ponds or streams, diversified native forest, and open vegetation including abundant nectar-rich flowers.'

Abstract: 'Conservation of biodiversity and mitigation of global warming are two major environmental challenges today. In this context, the relationship between biodiversity (especially plant diversity) and soil carbon (C) sequestration (as a means of mitigating global warming) has become a subject of considerable scientific interest. This relationship was tested for homegardens (HG), a popular and sustainable agroforestry system in the tropics, in Thrissur district, Kerala, India. The major objectives were to examine how tree density and plant-stand characteristics of homegardens affect soil C sequestration. Soil samples were collected at four depths (0\xe2\x80\x9320, 20\xe2\x80\x9350, 50\xe2\x80\x9380, 80\xe2\x80\x93100\xc2\xa0cm) from HG of varying sizes and age classes, and their total C content determined. Tree density and plant-stand characteristics such as species richness (Margalef Index) and diversity (Shannon Index) of the HG were also determined. Results indicated that the soil C stock was directly related to plant diversity of HG. Homegardens with higher, compared to those with lower, number of plant species, as well as higher species richness and tree density had higher soil carbon, especially in the top 50\xc2\xa0cm of soil. Overall, within 1\xc2\xa0m profile, soil C content ranged from 101.5 to 127.4\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. Smaller-sized HG (<0.4\xc2\xa0ha) that had higher tree density and plant-species density had more soil C per unit area (119.3\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) of land than larger-sized ones (>0.4\xc2\xa0ha) (108.2\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921). Soil C content, especially below 50\xc2\xa0cm, was higher in older gardens. The enhanced soil-C storage in species-rich homegardens could have relevance and applications in broader ecological contexts.'

Abstract: '\nA study was carried out to assess tree diversity, forest carbon stock and carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration in Nambor tropical semi-evergreen forest. A total of 53 tree species from 47 genera and 32 families were recorded in the forest. Vatica lanceifolia was the dominant tree species with maximum 33.78 importance value index (IVI), 0.30 Shannon diversity index (H\xe2\x80\xb2) and 0.03 Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s index (D) followed by Lagerstroemia reginae (20.75 IVI, 0.18 H\xe2\x80\xb2 and 0.004 D), Dysoxylum excelsum (17.70 IVI, 0.20 H\xe2\x80\xb2 and 0.006 D), Sterculia villosa (14.15 IVI, 0.09 H\xe2\x80\xb2 and 0.0007 D) and Toona ciliata (11.60 IVI, 0.07 H\xe2\x80\xb2 and 0.0004 D) as codominant species. Among the forest carbon pools, maximum 50.32% carbon was stored in soil followed by 39.42% in above ground biomass and 10.21, 0.03 and 0.02% in below ground, leaf litter and dead debris pools, respectively. Total ecosystem carbon stock in Nambor forest was estimated to be 244.78\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. The estimated carbon stock was extrapolated over 3700 hectare area and found to be 905186.50\xc2\xa0Mg. The total forest carbon stock was also converted into CO2 equivalents and estimated as 3,322,034.46\xc2\xa0Mg. The study observed that forest ecosystem offsets significant amount of atmospheric CO2; therefore, conservation and management of forest resources are imperative to combat global climate change.'

Abstract: 'This study explored local controls relating to trees and spacesof the local environment in Nyamaropa Communal Lands in theNyanga District of eastern Zimbabwe. Controls were consideredin a broad and inclusive framework encompassing codified rules,taboos, and, regulatory norms and emotions. Special emphasis waslaid on people\xe2\x80\x98s emotional and ethical investment in the abovecomponents of the environment \xe2\x80\x93 trees and spaces. The studyemployed intensive informal and group interviews. Results showthat there is tremendous emotional and ethical investment intrees and spaces of the environment in Nyamaropa. Emotions comein a variety of forms: fear, shunning, love, reverence, andconfidence and security enhancement. The emotional and ethicalnorms are designed to govern behavior and the context of resourceutilization. These norms have implications on the organization ofspaces of the local environment and regimes of resource utilizationoccurring in them. Location of resources in spaces of the environmenthas implications on the management of resources within them. Thedomains of human habitation \xe2\x80\x93 home bases and home fields \xe2\x80\x93 werefound to be the most emotionally laden spaces with trees in thembeing actively planted, nurtured, conserved, eliminated, or destroyedon the basis of certain emotions and norms.

Abstract: 'Shoreline changes on account of global climate change and sea level rise is one of the major problems along the coastlines in different continents of the world. This study was carried out along the coastlines of Andhra Pradesh state in India using multi-temporal satellite images from 1973 to 2015 period. Long-term coastal erosion and accretion rate over a period of 42\xc2\xa0years has calculated using Digital Shoreline Analysis System and prepared shoreline maps by using GIS-Software. End point rate (EPR) statistical method is applied to estimate the shoreline change rate. Various coastal parameters like sea level rise, geomorphology, elevation and coastal slope were used to find out the interactive relationship between the physical parameters and shoreline changes in the area. The study revealed that the coastal changes are more dominant in Krishna and Godavari Deltaic plain. The average erosion and accretion rate observed in the Krishna Godavari delta was 10.63 and 17.29\xc2\xa0m per year respectively. The study indicated that, climatic changes and fluvial process are playing key role in changing shoreline positions. The study exhibited that elevation and slope are played intense role in the shoreline positional change. The present study demonstrates that combined use of satellite imagery and EPR statistical method as an accurate and reliable method for shoreline change analysis.'

Abstract: 'While deliberations relating to negative consequences of large dams on the environment continue to dominate world attention, positive benefits provided by small dams, also known as check dams, go unobserved. Besides, little is known about the potential of check dams in mitigating global warming impacts due to less data availability. Small dams are usually commissioned to private contractors who do not have clear mandate from their employers to post their work online for public scrutiny. As a result, statistics on the design, cost, and materials used to build check dams are not available in public domain. However, this review paper presents data for the first time on the often ignored potential of check dams mitigating climate-induced hydrological threats. We hope that the scientific analysis presented in this paper will promote further research on check dams worldwide to better comprehend their eco-friendly significance serving society.'

Abstract: 'The zoogeographical distribution of branchiobdellidans (Annelida) and temnocephalidans (Platyhelminthes), ectosymbiotic on freshwater crustaceans, is reviewed and revised. In the areas where the Holarctic branchiobdellidans and Gondwanian temnocephalidans overlap, distributions of species and their respective hosts are reviewed in detail. Specimens of the branchiobdellid, Branchiobdella astaci, and the scutariellid temnocephalidan, Bubalocerus pretneri, were allowed to meet in vitro on the dorsal carapace of a crayfish, Austropotamobius pallipes. This usually resulted in the scutariellid being ingested by a branchiobdellid. Specimens of B. astaci were placed in contact with the host of B. pretneri, Troglocaris sp., a cave-dwelling shrimp and the branchiobdellid immediately moved away from the shrimp.'

Abstract: 'In the present study, post-mortem was conducted on a female elephant aged about 37\xc2\xa0years died at Rajeev Gandhi National Park, Hunsur, Mathigoodu Elephant Camp, Karnataka state. The animal suffered with diarrhoea, anorexia, dehydration and was unable to walk for about one week before death and was treated with antibiotics and fluid therapy for three days. The post-mortem examination revealed that, the gastric mucosa was severely congested, hyperaemic and numerous stomach bots attached to the mucosa. The bots were recovered from the gastric mucosa and processed for species identification. The posterior spiracles of the bots showed three longitudinal parallel slits in each spiracle, the abdominal segments had a row of belt like triangular shaped spines and the anterior end had two powerful oral hooks with cephalo-pharyngeal skeleton. Based on the above said morphological characters, the bots were identified as Cobboldia elephantis. This seems to be the first report of C. elephantis in free range wild elephant from Karnataka state.'

Abstract: 'A jungle tribe, the Jenu-Kurubas gather the honey in the month of June. Having hit upon a hive in a hollow tree, they tie a bamboo, the short cut branches of which form a convenient ladder, to the tree during the day time and at night, provided with a basket attached to a long rope and lined with leaves, they climb up with a strongly smoking torch which they hold near the hive. The alarmed and half stunned bees fly away and their honeycombs are removed and let down in the basket. Whilst thus engaged, the Kurubas have a peculiar song, made for the occasion and expressing their feigned sympathy with the spoilated bees, so rudely disturbed of their nightly rest.

URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1746-4269-4-15
Abstract: 'Consumption of greens is a major source of vitamins and micro-nutrients for people using only vegetarian diets rich in carbohydrates. In remote rural settlements where vegetable cultivation is not practiced and market supplies are not organized, local inhabitants depend on indigenous vegetables, both cultivated in kitchen gardens and wild, for enriching the diversity of food. Knowledge of such foods is part of traditional knowledge which is largely transmitted through participation of individuals of households. A total of 123 households in six villages of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve buffer zone was surveyed using a schedule to assess the knowledge, availability and consumption pattern of wild leafy vegetables. Quantity estimations were done using regular visits with informants from 30 sample households of the six study villages during the collections. Monetization was used to see the value of wild leafy vegetables harvested during a year. The diversity of wild leafy vegetables being use by the local inhabitants is 21 species belonging to 14 genera and 11 families. This is far less than that being reported to be used by the communities from Western Ghats in India and some parts of Africa. Irrespective of social or economic status all households in the study villages had the knowledge and used wild leafy vegetables. The number of households reported to consume these wild leafy vegetables is greater than the number of households reporting to harvest them for all species except for Diplazium esculentum and Phytolacca acinosa. The availability and use period varied for the species are listed by the users. The study indicated that the knowledge is eroding due to changing social values and non participation of younger generation in collection and processing of such wild leafy vegetables.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity is the sum total of all living things on the earth with particular reference to the profound variety in structure, function and genetic constitution. It includes both number and frequency of species or genes in a given assemblage and the variety of resulting ecosystems in a region. It is usually considered at three different levels: genetic, species and ecological diversities. Genus Drosophila belongs to the family Drosophilidae (class Insecta, order Diptera), characterized by rich species diversity at global level and also in India, which is a megadiverse country. At global level, more than 1500 species have been described and several thousands estimated. Hawaiian Islands are particularly rich in species diversity with more than 500 species which provides a unique opportunity to study evolution in genus Drosophila. About 150 species of Drosophila have been reported from India. Certain species of Drosophila found in India have been investigated for genetic diversity within the species. In this regard, Drosophila ananassae is noteworthy. It is a cosmopolitan and domestic species with common occurrence in India and is endowed with many genetic peculiarities. Population genetics and evolutionary studies in this species have revealed as to how genetic diversity within a species play an important role in adaptation of populations to varying environments. In addition, the work carried on D. melanogaster, D. nasuta, D. bipectinata and certain other species in India has shown that these species vary in degree and pattern of genetic diversity, and have evolved different mechanisms for adjusting to their environments. The ecological adaptations to various kinds of stress studied in certain species of Drosophila inhabiting the Indian subcontinent are also discussed.'

Abstract: 'In recent years, the Taiwanese government has strongly promoted the concept of ecological engineering in the hope that doing so will encourage the maintenance of the ecosystem and its integrity. As a result, the riprap spur dike is one of the most commonly used measures for protecting stream banks. Traditionally, a spur dike is used at concave banks to prevent their scouring and/or to increase their stabilization. An additional benefit of deflector structures, like spur dikes, may be to increase the weighted usable area (WUA) for aquatic life survival during periods of increased flow (examples include typhoon, flood, etc.). A two-dimensional river habitat simulation program (River2D) coupled with a developed shallow water habitat type diversity module was used for the case study at a headwater stream in central Taiwan. The habitat suitability index for this study was established using substrate, depth, and velocity from field surveys for the fish family Cyprinidae by prepositioned area electrofisher. The ungauged flood conditions were calculated using digital elevation models within a watershed delineation and hydrological modeling system in accordance with local regulations. Simulated results indicate that the spur dikes currently in use on the stream in this study need be improved from a WUA point of view more effectively handle a flood event.'

Abstract: 'The purpose of this study was to characterize the land use, vegetation structure, and diversity in the Barnowpara Sanctuary, Raipur district, Chhattisgarh, India through the use of satellite remote sensing and GIS. Land cover and vegetation were spatially analyzed by digitally classifying IRS 1D LISS III satellite data using a maximum likelihood algorithm. Later, the variations in structure and diversity in different forest types and classes were quantified by adopting quadratic sampling procedures. Nine land-cover types were delineated: teak forest, dense mixed forest, degraded mixed forest, Sal mixed forest, open mixed forest, young teak plantation, grasslands, agriculture, habitation, and water bodies. The classification accuracy for different land-use classes ranged from 71.23% to 100%. The highest accuracy was observed in water bodies and grassland, followed by habitation and agriculture, teak forest, degraded mixed forest, and dense mixed forest. The accuracy was lower in open mixed forest, and sal mixed forest. Results revealed that density of different forest types varied from 324 to 733 trees ha-1, basal area from 8.13 to 28.87 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 and number of species from 20 to 40. Similarly, the diversity ranged from 1.36 to 2.98, concentration of dominance from 0.06 to 0.49, species richness from 3.88 to 6.86, and beta diversity from 1.29 to 2.21. The sal mixed forest type recorded the highest basal area, diversity was highest in the dense mixed forest, and the teak forest recorded maximum density, which was poor in degraded mixed forests. The study also showed that Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was strongly correlated to with the Shannon Index and species richness.'

Abstract: 'Arsenic (As) in the soils of South-Eastern Bangladesh is not only a threat for the health of millions of people but also a problem for plant growth due to its higher concentration in soil. Gmelina arborea Linn. is a promising fast growing tree species in Bangladesh which has also a potential to be planted in arsenic contaminated areas. This study assessed the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on the growth of G. arborea in arsenic amended soils at nursery stage. Before sowing seeds, soils were treated with four different concentrations (10 mg\xc2\xb7kg\xe2\x88\x921, 25 mg\xc2\xb7kg\xe2\x88\x921, 50 mg\xc2\xb7kg\xe2\x88\x921, and 100 mg\xc2\xb7kg\xe2\x88\x921) of Arsenic. Growth parameters (length of shoot and root, collar diameter, fresh and dry weight of shoot and root) of the plant, and mycorrhizal root colonization and spore population in the rhizosphere soil of G. arborea were recorded. Mycorrhizal seedlings showed better growth than non-mycorrhizal seedlings. Mycorrhizal seedlings planted in soil with 10-mg\xc2\xb7kg\xe2\x88\x921 arsenic showed best performance in terms of growth, biomass and mycorrhizal colonization, compared to other treatments with higher concentration of arsenic. With increasing arsenic concentration, growth of seedlings, mycorrhizal infection rate and spore population, all decreased significantly (p<0.05). The mycorrhizal seedlings had as much as 40% higher increment in total growth and 2.4 times higher increment in biomass compared to non-mycorrhizal seedlings. The study clearly indicated that mycorrhizal inoculation could reduce the harmful effects of arsenic on the initial growth of G. arborea Linn. in degraded soil at nursery stage.'

Abstract: 'Ecotones have received great attention due to its critical function in energy flux, species harbor, global carbon sequestration, and land-atmosphere interaction. This study investigated land use pattern and spatial heterogeneity of the ecotones among agricultural land, forest land, and grassland of the southeastern Da Hinggan Mountains in the northeastern China. The change of these delineated ecotones under different slopes and aridity conditions was analyzed by two landscape indices, edge density (ED) and core area percentage of landscape (CPL), to explore the inter-linkage between spatial structure of ecotones and socioeconomic development and land management. Specifically, the ecotones such as agriculture-forest (AF) ecotone, forest-grassland (FG) ecotone, and agriculture-forest-grassland (AFG) ecotone moved from the arid southeast to the humid northwest. The flat area with small slope is more edge-fragmented than the steep area since the ED decreases as the slope increases. The AF ecotone mostly found in the humid region is moving to more humid areas while the agriculture-grassland (AG) ecotone mostly found in the dry region is moving towards the drier region.'

Abstract: 'Dendrochronological research in Southeast Asia is under development; however, the amount of tress with potential for dendrochronological studies is restricted. For example, teak trees from India, Myanmar, Thailand, and Java are valuable dendrochronologic studies for ready climate response. Teak from Java is best suited for studying the El Ni\xc3\xb1o-Southern Oscillation and sea-surface temperatures, whereas Indian teak is used to reconstruct periods of drought in India. Further, Thai teak and Vietnamese cypress trees captured the long drought period that led to the demise of the Angkor reign (fourteenth\xe2\x80\x93fifteenth century). Diverse techniques including anatomical observation, cambial markings, cell differentiation, and isotopic analysis prove the age and growth of invisible tropical tree rings. A number of invisible growth rings in trees from both tropical and subtropical forests have been identified, resulting in the advancement of dendrochronology. Climate change is a substantial challenge for most living things and natural resources. A greater understanding of tree species adaptation in this region is necessary. The understanding of long-term paleoclimate can be gained by researching old samples and archaeological materials from this region.'

Abstract: 'Forest plays a vital role in regulating climate through carbon sequestration in its biomass. Biomass reflects the health and environmental conditions of a forest ecosystem. In context to the climate change mitigation mechanisms like REDD (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), an extensive forest monitoring campaign is especially important. Remote sensing of forest structure and biomass with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) bears significant potential for mapping and understanding forest ecological processes. Limitations of the conventional forest inventory procedures, like the extensive cost, labor and time, can be overcome through integrated geospatial techniques. Optical sensor or SAR data are suitable for extracting information about simple and homogeneous forest stand sites. However, optical sensors face serious limitations, specifically in tropical regions, like the cloud cover that SAR can overcome along with targeting saturation and penetration aspects. Simultaneous use of spectral information and image texture parameters improves the biomass assessment over undulating terrain and in radical conditions. Also, synergic use of multi-sensor optical and SAR has better potential than single sensor. Interferometric (InSAR) and polarimetric (PolSAR) SAR or a combination of the both (PolInSAR) serves as effective alternatives. These techniques could serve as valuable methods for biomass assessment of heterogeneous complex biophysical environments. However, SAR data have its own limitations and complexities. Identifying, understanding and solving major uncertainties in different stages of the biomass estimation procedure are critical. In this regard, the current study provides a review of radar remote sensing-based studies in forest biomass estimation.'

Abstract: 'We studied the ranging pattern of the wild black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) at Xiaochangdu, Tibet from June 2003 to March 2005. Using the map grid cell method, the group home range were 16.75 km2 in summer, 10.50 km2 in winter, and 21.25 km2 total over two years. The daily travel length (DTL) averaged 765 m with a range of 350\xe2\x80\x933500 m. The results showed that DTL in winter was significantly shorter than those of in summer and spring. Temperature, rainfall, food availability, and human disturbance correlated positively with DTL. According to the maximum observed group size and estimated total home range, population density and biomass of R. bieti were 9.1 individuals/km2 and 88.6 kg/km2, respectively. The temporal and spatial variations of food resources and patterns of human disturbance largely determine the ranging behavior of R. bieti at Xiaochangdu.'

Abstract: 'Genetic and genotypic variabilities of a rare relict aquatic plant Nelumbo komarovii Grossh. from six natural populations of Primorsky krai (Russia) were assessed using isozyme analysis. The highest genetic and genotypic diversities were observed in the Razdol\xe2\x80\x99noe and Okeanskaya populations, which can be explained by cross-pollination participation in the seed formation for maintenance of the Razdol\xe2\x80\x99noe population size and by sowing seeds from different habitats for the Okeanskaya population. Low polymorphism at the population level (P = 8.97, HO = 0.055, HE = 0.039) is determined by the history of existence of the species from the Tertiary Period as well as by the influence of gene drift. Clonal renewal plays a decisive role in the propagation of N. komarovii in most natural populations.'

Abstract: 'The soil seed bank is a dynamic biotic component of plant communities that represents the population\xe2\x80\x99s memory in relation to selective events. Few studies have investigated the natural stock of germinable seeds in the gallery forests to evaluate their regeneration potential, although they are target of anthropogenic action. Thus, seasonal, horizontal, and vertical qualitative and quantitative variations of the seed bank of a gallery forest in the Brazilian Cerrado were studied to test the influence of the climatic seasonality, the influence of the physical structure, and depth of the soil in different microhabitats of the forest in this natural seed store. It was also compared the richness and abundance of species in the germinable seed bank with the above-ground vegetation. Three hundred and seventy-five soil samples were collected at the beginning (April 1998 and 1999) and at the end of the dry season (September 1998). These samples were collected in three microhabitats distributed transversally in relation to drainage line of a large stream, at five depths. The density of germinable seeds decreases with depth, and is similar among microhabitats and seasons. In 24,690\xc2\xa0cm3 of soil and 4.05\xc2\xa0m2 of litter, 1390 seedlings emerged, being 743 dicotyledons and 647 monocotyledons. From 761 survivors, 263 were Cyperaceae, 206 Melastomataceae, 153 Poaceae, and 82 Onagraceae, the most abundant families. This study suggests that the diversity of the germinable soil seed bank is lower than that of the above-ground vegetation of the forest, and that the soil seed bank is not the principal regeneration form of this environment.'

Abstract: 'This paper reflects on the impacts of agrarian change and social reorganisation on gender-nature relations through the lens of an indigenous group named the Kuruma in South India. Building upon recent work of feminist political ecology, I uncover a number of dualisms attached to the gender-nature nexus and put forward that gender roles are constituted by social relations which need to be analysed with regard to the transformative potential of gender-nature relations. Three main themes are at the centre of the empirical inquiry: gender subjectivities, rural off-farm employment and the human-nature nexus. I seek to show that, first, the production of gendered subjectivities cannot be simplified through essentialist assumptions that romanticise women\xe2\x80\x99s relationships with nature; second, off-farm employment strategies both reinforce the social hierarchy in gender and contradict the Kuruma\xe2\x80\x99s moral economies; and, finally, environmental and agrarian change redefine the use of agrobiodiversity and are related to ideas on progressive versus nonprogressive cultivation practices. The research is informed by qualitative research methods and offers a conceptual approach to the deconstruction of gender-nature relations from a poststructuralist feminist perspective.'

Abstract: 'Systematic studies of the Borajan Reserve Forest in Assam, India, were conducted in 1995, 1997, and 1998. Initially this small (5 km2) forest was inhabited by substantial numbers of five species of diurnal primates and the forest was typical of Reserve Forests in northwest upper Assam. About two thirds of the forest had canopy cover of 20 \xe2\x80\x93 50% or more. Civil unrest, political problems and a lack of resources for Forest Department personnel, however, resulted in rapid degradation of the area. After three years less than one third of the forest had more than 20% canopy cover; all primate populations had declined dramatically and the small percentage of juveniles in each species indicated that all were in imminent danger of local extinction. There was no evidence of hunting or trapping nor any large scale logging. Forest degradation was due primarily to small scale harvesting of forest products, selective cutting, and collection of firewood. Although only hand tools were employed, the forest inexorably declined in response to these steady pressures. Borajan may be an object lesson as to what can happen but it need not be the harbinger of Assam\xe2\x80\x99s future.'

Abstract: 'India is a thickly populated country; apart from having biodiversity among people, climate does change from place to place. Western Ghats of South India harbors variety of plantations and diverse creatures. Agriculture is the primary occupation of the people and some tribes living in these regions. Here majority are callous/ ignorant in employing neither advanced farming techniques nor safety precautions, hence are exposed to bites and stings by animals. Of these, snake bites cause significant mortality and morbidity. Proper care for some of these individuals is out of reach. Identification of offending snake, snake bite injury or findings of envenomation is a key not only for the administration of antisnake venom but also for the victim to realize that he needs an expert care. Unless he believes it to be a critical snake bite and not a thorn prick, scorpion sting or a spider bite he will not approach a health care provider. To know about these dangerous signs that may help the victim to realize it as a case of snake bite, current study is employed on fatal cases in this region.'

Abstract: ' Oryza officinalis complex is the largest and the most complicated group in the genus Oryza L., consisting of about ten species with the B, C, BC, CD, and E genomes. Taxonomy and identification of the species, particularly those with the B, C and BC genomes, are difficult due to the similar morphology and overlapping distribution of some species. The difference in ploidy levels of some species adds more complexity. In the present study, we surveyed 64 accessions of rice germplasm in the O. officinalis complex using RFLP analysis of PCR-amplified Adh genes in addition to chromosome counting. The results confirmed that all O. rhizomatis accessions are diploids with the C genome, whereas all O. minuta accessions are tetraploids having the BC genome. However, both diploid and tetraploid forms were found for the accessions identified in the genebank as O. officinalis, O. punctata and O. eichingeri. The tetraploid form of \xe2\x80\x98O. officinalis\xe2\x80\x99 with the BC genome is exclusively distributed in India and has been described as O. malampuzhaensis. The tetraploid form of O. punctata which has been called O. schweinfurthiana by some workers was found to be as widely distributed as its diploid form in Africa. It is noteworthy that two accessions that had been determined as tetraploid O. officinalis were actually belonging to a species with the CD genome (O. latifolia). Our results promote a better understanding of the genomic constitutions of many accessions in the O. officinalis complex and correct determination of the genebank material, which serves as an important basis of germplasm cataloguing for further research and utilization.'

Abstract: 'Lakes and wetlands are dynamic geomorphic units of a landscape that hold geochemical signatures of sediment provenance and paleo-environmental shifts and are major sinks for organic matter accumulation. The source of organic matter is diverse in lake sediments and varies widely with the type and size of the lake and hence it is important to understand the source of organic carbon (terrestrial or in situ) in lake systems in order to monitor the health of the lake. Wular lake, located in north Kashmir, is one of the largest fresh water lake in India, situated at an average elevation of 1580m ASL. The lake is fed by a number of watersheds that bring a diverse type of sediments and organic matter and thus deposit them into the Wular lake basin. In order to understand sediment distribution pattern, content and source of organic matter, sediment provenance and the persisting environment in the Wular lake, 32 lake floor sediment samples covering the entire lake were collected and analyzed for organic element analysis, CaCO3, organic matter, sediment texture and diatom analysis. The results indicated that sediments in the lake are dominated by silt and silty clay. The organic carbon in the lake ranged from 0.83%-4.52% and nitrogen varied from 0.06%-0.5%. The Carbon to Nitrogen (C/N) ratios (9.04 to 22.03) indicate a mixed source of organic carbon but dominated by in situ lake sources from the vascular and lake biota accumulation. The diatom analysis revealed the occurrence of a diverse type of species along the sampling sites present within the lake. The wide distribution of the diatom species such as Cymbella, Cyclotella and Tabularia etc. in the lake indicate high organic pollution and alkaline fresh water environment prevailing in the lake.'

Abstract: 'The most significant large-scale environmental challenge that many countries, especially in the arid and semi-arid regions of the world, will face in the middle and long-term are water scarcity problems, which are attributed to climate change impacts such as temperature increase, abundance of high solar radiation, and aridity in addition to population pressure. In many countries, current water resources use already exceeds sustainable and renewable supply. Various methodologies are suggested to increase the sources of water supply, among which one of the alternatives is rainwater and runoff harvesting (ROH). Water scarcity and additional stress are among the most specific problems in arid and semi-arid regions, where vegetation cover is very weak under extensive solar irradiation effects with high evaporation rates. Present global warming, climate change impacts, and their future patterns are expected to cause increase in the evapotranspiration rates and hence reduction in the groundwater recharges. Under such circumstances, any simple but effective water storage augmentation facility as the artificial groundwater recharge gains vital importance for sustainability of water supply and survivals in desert ecosystems. Although intensive and frequent rainfall events are rare they generate significant surface water flow during occasional floods and especially flash floods with huge amounts of surface water. It is, therefore, necessary to enhance artificial groundwater recharge from consequent frequent runoffs through suitable hydraulic structures. This paper aims at assessing the importance of ROH systems for domestic supply in arid regions with specific reference to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. For this purpose, it presents ROH from the surface flows in depressions of Quaternary wadi deposits in arid and semi-arid regions.'

Abstract: ' Aconitum balfourii (Bruhl) Muk. (Ranunculaceae) is an endangered medicinal plant. Natural populations were surveyed in the northwest Himalaya for population estimation and evaluation of elite germplasm. Vegetation sampling of quadrats was conducted using the vertical belt transect method in areas supporting A. balfourii. Plant density and relative dominance of A. balfourii were low compared with other alpine species. Threat status was determined on a site-by-site basis as well as for entire western Himalaya. A. balfourii was generally classified as endangered on the basis of geographic distribution and critically endangered on the basis of abundance. We found the natural geographic distribution of A. balfourii to be diminishing due to habitat destruction. Immediate corrective management measures are needed for sustainable utilization and long-term conservation of the species in the wild.'

Abstract: 'The present investigation deals with limnobiotic status of the Almatti reservoir from February, 2003 to January, 2005. The study revealed that there exists a fluctuations of the physical factors viz., rainfall, humidity, air and water temperature, pH and electrical conductivity (EC), and chemical factors viz., dissolved oxygen (DO), free carbon dioxide, total alkalinity, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, chloride, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, bicarbonate and total dissolved solids (TDS). From the data it was also apparent that correlations between the physico-chemical factors and dynamics of phytoplankton could be seen. The simple correlation coefficient test revealed that the cyanophytes number was positively correlated with DO, nitrate, phosphate and negatively significant with total hardness, total alkalinity, EC, calcium, magnesium, sulphate, bicarbonate and TDS. They are inversely correlated with pH, chloride, rainfall and humidity. Bacillariphyceae are correlated with total alkalinity, bicarbonates, magnesium and TDS, whereas inverse correlation was found with rainfall, humidity, pH and phosphate. Desmids showed positive correlation with nitrates, while it was inversely correlated with chloride, rainfall and humidity. Dinophytes density was positively correlated with total alkalinity, EC, total hardness, calcium, bicarbonate, while it showed inverse correlation with rainfall, humidity and phosphate. However, it is obvious that the absence of significant difference between sampling stations for all these parameters in the Almatti reservoir indicated fairly homogeneous conditions and the water quality is also found to be homogeneous.'

Abstract: 'Arjinshan National Nature Reserve (ANNR) is one of 3 refuges of the endemic ungulates Tibetan wild ass (Equus kiang), Chiru (Pantholops hodgsonii) and wild yak (Bos mutus) that are endangered by natural and anthropogenic factors in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Identifying habitat suitability is critical for species protection management. We used a GIS-based niche model to delimit and classify habitat suitability using an integrated assessment system, which included 9 biotic and abiotic factors. We divided the research area into 4 habitat types for these ungulates: (1) high suitability habitat; (2) moderate suitability habitat; (3) low suitability habitat; and (4) unsuitable area. Results suggested that chiru have the most areas of high and moderate suitability habitats while Tibetan wild ass had the largest areas of low suitability habitat and unsuitable area. Wild yak had the largest area of moderate and low suitability habitat, but high suitability habitats for wild yak were smaller than those of other 2 ungulates. There was overlap of high-quality habitat for the three kinds of ungulates in the vicinity of Kardun inspection station, which could be regarded as the core area for the coexistence and conservation of these endangered ungulate populations.'

Abstract: 'This study provides an analysis of biotic change in successive mammalian communities during the last 1.8 million years of the Cretaceous (67.3\xe2\x80\x9365.58 Ma) from the Hell Creek Formation in Garfield County, Montana. Results show changes in relative abundances of species, mean individual body size, and to some extent taxonomic composition through the Hell Creek Formation. These results are interpreted as \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d mammalian responses to fluctuating temperatures during the latest Cretaceous. By contrast, the extinction of 22\xe2\x80\x9327 mammalian species at or near the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary cannot be explained by the coincident cooling interval alone. At the scale of temporal resolution available, these fossil data are inconsistent with an extended gradual pattern of extinction (linear-response) and are most consistent with either a non-linear response pattern for the K-T extinction, resulting from the accumulated stress of multiple long- and short-term environmental perturbations (e.g., climate change, sea-level regression, volcanism, an extraterrestrial impact), or a single, short-term cause (an extraterrestrial impact).'

Abstract: 'The chloroplast loci matK, rbcL, atpB, rpoC1, plastid spacer region psbA-trnH and nuclear internal transcribed spacer loci ITS sequences were evaluated for its discriminating ability among the closely related medicinal plant species of Apocynaceae. Our main criteria for ranking these barcodes were based on levels of inter and intra-specific divergence. Twenty-one medicinal plants were sequenced for matK, rbcL, atpB, rpoC1, psbA-trnH and ITS. Additionally sequences collected from GenBank were also included in this study. Altogether, 1,876 DNA sequences were used that included 525 sequences belonging to 110 genera of matK, 390 sequences belonging to 68 genera of rbcL, 90 sequences belonging to 13 genera of atpB, 38 sequences belonging to 16 genera of rpoC1, 32 sequences belonging to 27 genera of psbA-trnH and 780 sequences belonging to 70 genera of ITS region. The analyses of inter-specific and intra-specific divergence using the cpDNA spacer region psbA-trnH showed 0.3\xe2\x80\x930.5 and 0.04\xe2\x80\x930.2\xc2\xa0%, whereas matK showed 0.8\xe2\x80\x931 and 0.07\xe2\x80\x930.1\xc2\xa0% inter-specific and intra-specific divergence, respectively. Likewise rbcL showed 0.4\xe2\x80\x930.5\xc2\xa0% inter-specific divergence and 0.2\xe2\x80\x930.1\xc2\xa0% intra-specific divergence. The gene rpoC1 showed 0.2\xe2\x80\x930.3\xc2\xa0% inter-specific divergence and 0.02\xe2\x80\x930.01\xc2\xa0% intra-specific divergence, respectively. Similarly atpB showed 0.1\xe2\x80\x930.4\xc2\xa0% inter-specific divergence and 0.09\xe2\x80\x930.04\xc2\xa0% of intra-specific divergence. The nrDNA ITS (ITS1 and ITS2) were analyzed and the results indicated that ITS2 showed better discriminating ability, as it resulted in considerable variation at the generic and species level. The inter-specific divergence in ITS2 ranged from 1 to 9\xc2\xa0% with an average of 8\xc2\xa0% and the intra-specific divergence ranged from 0.4 to 6\xc2\xa0% with an average of 4\xc2\xa0%. Thus, ITS2 successfully identified the species and genera at the rate of 91 and 98\xc2\xa0%, respectively. The cpDNA spacer psbA-trnH exhibited an identification percentage of 40 and 36\xc2\xa0% at the genus and species level, respectively. Additionally ITS2 was also used to authenticate the herbal medicinal species of the genus Caralluma, Rauwolfia and Hoodia. Overall, our data suggest that nuclear ITS2 is the ideal barcode loci to identify/discriminate the large plant family Apocynaceae.'

Abstract: 'In 2003, the Three Gorges Project (TGP, China), currently the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest hydroelectric power plant by total capacity, went into operation. Due to large-scale impoundment of the Yangtze River and its tributaries and also due to resettlement, extensive environmental impacts like land use change and increase of geohazards are associated with the TGP. Within the Yangtze Project, we investigate these effects for the Xiangxi (\xe9\xa6\x99\xe6\xba\xaa) catchment which is part of the Three Gorges Reservoir. The aim of this study is to evaluate the susceptibility for mass movement within the Xiangxi River backwater area using geographic information system (GIS). We used existing mass movements and the conditioning factors (geology, elevation, slope, curvature, land use, and land use change) for analyzing mass movement susceptibility. Mass movements and geology were mapped in the field to establish a mass movement inventory and a geological map. Land use and digital elevation model (DEM) were obtained from remote-sensing data. We determined the relation between mass movements and the conditioning factors by using the frequency ratio method and found strong relation between mass movements and both natural and human-influenced conditioning factors.'

Abstract: 'Before an exotic pathogen can be released as a classical biological control agent the likely positive and negative outcomes of that introduction must be predicted. Host range testing is used to assess potential damage to non-target plants. To-date 28 species of fungi have been released as classical biological control agents against weeds world-wide. These pathogens have been reported infecting only six non-target plant species outdoors and all of these incidents were predicted. Many more non-target plant species developed disease symptoms in glasshouse tests than in the field. Consequently, data from other sources are needed to ensure potential agents are not prematurely rejected. Predictions of pathogen host range to date have been sufficiently accurate to prevent unpleasant surprises. Exotic pathogens are a safe and useful tool for weed control, especially in natural areas rich in valued non-target species.'

Abstract: 'Disturbance, man-made or natural, is an innate process of any landscape. Disturbance gradient analysis provides insight into the disturbance status of forest which is useful for forest management. In the present study new landscape metrics are introduced through FRAGSTATS 3.3 software for analyzing both anthropogenic and natural disturbance pattern of Daltonganj south forest division of Jharkhand state. Various landscape indices were used for natural disturbance analysis. Anthropogenic disturbance was measured as function of the proximity of landscape to roads and settlements. It was observed that the forests of the study area are experiencing varied degrees of disturbances. The software in combination with ARC VIEW Spatial Analyst was found to be a cost effective and user friendly landscape analysis tool.'

Abstract: 'For forest ecosystem management to be effective, knowledge of the horizontal and vertical structural diversity of a forest is essential. The moist Afromontane highlands of Wondo Genet in south-central Ethiopia present an opportunity to restore and rehabilitate and enhance the ecosystem services to be obtained from this forest sustainably. We focused on the forest structural characteristics to better understand the current forest conditions to assist in the sustainable management of this resource. A total of 75 (20 m \xc3\x97 20 m) quadrats were sampled and diameter at breast height (DBH) \xe2\x89\xa5 2 cm and stem height \xe2\x89\xa5 2 m were measured. Species identity and abundance, elevation, slope, and aspect were recorded for each plot. Structural characteristics were computed for each plot. Relationship of topographic factors with vegetation characteristics was conducted using R-Software. A total of 72 woody species was recorded. Whereas, the overall diameter distribution shows an inverted J-shaped curve, the basal area followed a bell-shaped pattern. Five types of population structures are revealed. The mean tree density and basal area was 397.3 stems\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 31.4 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. Only 2.8% of the tree species have densities of >25 stems\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 and the percentage distribution of trees show 56.2% in the DBH class 2\xe2\x80\x9310 cm, indicating that the forest is dominated by medium-sized trees. Celtis africana (8.81 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921) and Pouteria adolfi-friedericii (5.13 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921) make the highest contribution to the basal area and species importance value index. The families/species with the highest importance value index are Ulmaceae, Fabacea and Sapotaceae. Species abundance (r 2 =0.32, p <0.001) and species richness (r 2 =0.50, p <0.001) are positively related with tree density. Tree density is negatively related with elevation (r 2 =\xe2\x88\x920.36, p <0.001), slope (r 2 =\xe2\x88\x920.15, p <0.001) and aspect (r 2 =\xe2\x88\x920.07, p <0.05). While basal area is negatively related with elevation (r 2 =\xe2\x88\x920.14, p <0.001), it has a positive relationship with tree density (r 2 =0.28, p <0.001 and species richness (r 2 =0.098). Species with poor population structure should be assisted by restoration tasks and further anthropogenic disturbance such as illegal logging and fuel wood extraction should be restricted.'

Abstract: ' Sesuvium portulacastrum L. (seapurslane) is a halophyte used as pioneer species in sand dune fixation and stabilization of saline soil. Studies on the morphological and molecular diversity were carried out for the 14 clones of Sesuvium collected from the different coastal regions of India. Significant differences were observed for morphological traits viz., length, width, diameter and area of leaf, internodal distance and stem diameter for different clones when compared with the clone from Gujarat state (GJ1). A UPGMA dendrogram for morphological traits based on the Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s similarity coefficient clustered the clones into three groups considering 80% polymorphism as criteria. Molecular diversity among the clones was studied using Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and markers specific to Ac homologous region. Of the total 749 RAPD loci amplified with 70 random primers, 294 were polymorphic with 39.25% diversity. A phylogenetic tree constructed with UPGMA and SHAN, grouped the clones into three major clades based on RAPD data. The molecular diversity studied with ITS and markers specific to Ac homologous region revealed 37.50% and 66.66% polymorphism and clustered the clones into three and four clades, respectively. The genetic diversity analysis revealed wide variations among the S. portulacastrum clones, reflecting a high level of diversity within the species which might be due to anthropogenic impact and geographic environmental conditions. Further, the various clones from the different eco-geographic coastal localities might have originated from native places of wild abundance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to evaluate both morphological and genetic diversity among the Sesuvium clones collected from the distant habitats of the coastal regions of the India.'

Abstract: 'Conventional methods of delineating farming-pastoral ecotones were not quantitative and could not fully show their spatial distribution. The present paper attempts to develop quantitative methods for mapping farming-pastoral ecotones in China. Nine indicators, related to temperature, precipitation and altitude aspects, were selected to quantify ecological susceptibility of vegetation (crops and forage). Methods of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and expert score ranking combined with fuzzy set theory were applied to assign the weight for each indicator and to define the membership functions. The geographic information system (GIS) was used to manage the spatial database and conduct the spatial analysis. According to the spatial calculation of evaluation model integrated with GIS, the ecological susceptibility of vegetation (crops and forage) was mapped. Three different zones, pastoral area, farming-pastoral ecotones and farming area, were classified by spatial cluster analysis and the maximum likelihood classification for the numeric map of vegetation ecological susceptibility by GIS. This map was validated by the economic statistical result based on the ratio of the output value from animal husbandry in total output value of agriculture by the National Bureau of Statistics in China, indicating that the mapping of the farming-pastoral ecotones may be accepted.'

Abstract: 'The present study highlights the application of satellite remote sensing in the assessment and monitoring of the mangrove forests along the coastline in Goa state of India. Based on onscreen visual interpretation techniques various land use and land cover classes have been mapped and classified. An attempt has been made to analyse changes in the mangrove forest cover from 1994 to 2001 using IRS-1B LISS-II and IRS-1D LISS-III data. An increase in the mangrove vegetation in the important estuaries has been found during 1994 and 2001. During this period, the mangrove forest increased by 44.90 per cent as a result of increased protection and consequent regeneration. Plantation of mangrove species has been raised in 876 ha (1985 to 1997) by the State Forest Department\xc2\xa8'

Abstract: 'Species endemic to sky island systems are isolated to mountain peaks and high elevation plateaux both geographically and ecologically, making them particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Pressures associated with climate change have already been linked to local extinctions of montane species, emphasizing the importance of understanding the genetic diversity and population connectivity within sky islands systems for the conservation management of remaining populations. Our study focuses on the endangered alpine skink Pseudemoia cryodroma, which is endemic to the Victorian Alps in south-eastern Australia, and has a disjunct distribution in montane habitats above 1100\xc2\xa0m a.s.l. Using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite loci, we investigated species delimitation, genetic connectivity and population genetic structure across the geographic range of this species. We found discordance between genetic markers, indicating historical mtDNA introgression at one of the study sites between P. cryodroma and the closely related, syntopic P. entrecasteauxii. Molecular diversity was positively associated with site elevation and extent of suitable habitat, with inbreeding detected in three of the five populations. These results demonstrate the complex interaction between geography and habitat in shaping the population structure and genetic diversity of P. cryodroma, and highlight the importance of minimising future habitat loss and fragmentation for the long-term persistence of this species.'

Abstract: 'The present paper deals with the distribution of sediment and sediment-bound nutrients in two important coastal lagoons of southern Kerala such as the Ashtamudi Estuarine Lagoon in the Kollam district and the Kadinamkulam Lagoon in the Thiruvananthapuram district. Among the two lagoons, the former is coast perpendicular, and the latter is coast parallel. An analysis of the textural characteristics reveals that, in both lagoons, the estuarine mouth and areas close to it are dominated by sand and sand-rich sediment species, indicating a high-energy depositional regime prevailing the region. On the other hand, the silt and clay dominant arms are almost sheltered and enjoy a low-energy depositional environment. The nutrient and organic carbon contents in the sheltered areas are significantly higher than the most dynamic high-energy estuarine mouth regions. This peculiar behaviour of these coastal water bodies has to be given adequate importance while laying down strategies for the conservation and management of these fragile aquatic systems in the south-western coast of India in particular and tropical coasts of the world in general.'

Abstract: 'Microscopic-coprological examination of Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus L., 1798) dung piles (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8955) in South Wayanad Forest Division from March to August, 2017 revealed 74.5% prevalence of parasites in elephants. Ancylostoma sp. Anoplocephala sp., Strongyle type egg and Strongyloides sp. were the major parasites recorded. Strongyloides sp. and Strongyle type egg were observed more frequently (58.1%). Ancylostoma sp. and Anoplocephala sp. were constituted 1.8% each; mixed parasitic species infections were recorded. The frequency distribution of parasitic load in elephants showed skewed distribution of propagules. Centrifugal sedimentation and floatation methods of fecal examination of outer and inner regions of dung did not show significant difference in number of propagules. The highest number of parasitic propagules was recorded in floatation method. The number of propagules varied among dung samples of different herds collected from different localities. There were no relation between the parasitic load and age of elephants. The mean density of parasite eggs was higher in solitary animals (214.3\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x89155.4 epg) than herd elephants (147.78\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x89111.1 epg). Though parasitic load was higher in solitary males, based on the occurrence of parasites using logistic regression it was found that females had 1.83 times higher occurrence for parasitic infection than males. Both length and width of parasite egg size classes were used to classify into different taxonomic groups using discriminate function analysis. Three distinct size clusters were identified. Nematode and Cestode eggs were classified correctly with 95.7% accuracy. Since, the egg size was similar in nematode group separation into genus was difficult. Further, inclusion of stages of development of egg and larvae enable better separation.'

Abstract: '\nThe North East India houses around 130 ethnic tribal communities which exhibits unique tradition, dialect and culture. These communities collect edible plants from wild forming a common practice for livelihood and subsistence even today. Of the varieties of plant consumed, ferns and fern\xe2\x80\x93allies also constitute an important food supplement. An inventory survey was conducted in order to assess the wild edible ferns and fern\xe2\x80\x93allies which are used as vegetables by various ethnic communities of North East India. Altogether, twenty-three (23) ferns and fern\xe2\x80\x93allies are found to be edible, and used in preparing various cuisines. Four species viz. Diplazium esculentum (Retz.) Sw., Huperzia phlegmaria (L.) Rothm., Huperzia squarrosa (G. Forst.) Trevis. and Nephrolepis cordifolia (L.) C. Presl were cultivated in small scale for consumption and horticultural purposes, while the rest of the species were directly harvested from wild habitat. Role of these ferns in local cuisines, other reported uses and bioactive components were discussed. The study also emphasises on future development of ferns and its allies as potential vegetables in North East India.'

Abstract: 'We mapped the forest cover of Khadimnagar National Park (KNP) of Sylhet Forest Division and estimated forest change over a period of 22 years (1988\xe2\x80\x932010) using Landsat TM images and other GIS data. Supervised classification and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image classification approaches were applied to the images to produce three cover classes, viz. dense forest, medium dense forest, and bare land. The change map was produced by differencing classified imageries of 1988 and 2010 as before image and after image, respectively, in ERDAS IMAGINE. Error matrix and kappa statistics were used to assess the accuracy of the produced maps. Overall map accuracies resulting from supervised classification of 1988 and 2010 imageries were 84.6% (Kappa 0.75) and 87.5% (Kappa 0.80), respectively. Forest cover statistics resulting from supervised classification showed that dense forest and bare land declined from 526 ha (67%) to 417 ha (59%) and 105 ha (13%) to 8 ha (1%), respectively, whereas medium dense forest increased from 155 ha (20%) to 317 ha (40%). Forest cover change statistics derived from NDVI classification showed that dense forest declined from 525 ha (67%) to 421 ha (54%) while medium dense forest increased from 253 ha (32%) to 356 ha (45%). Both supervised and NDVI classification approaches showed similar trends of forest change, i.e. decrease of dense forest and increase of medium dense forest, which indicates dense forest has been converted to medium dense forest. Area of bare land was unchanged. Illicit felling, encroachment, and settlement near forests caused the dense forest decline while short and long rotation plantations raised in various years caused the increase in area of medium dense forest. Protective measures should be undertaken to check further degradation of forest at KNP.'

Title: 'Effects of forest fragmentation on Heliconia acuminata seedling recruitment in central Amazonia'

Abstract: ' I present the results of a 2-year experiment comparing seed predation, seed germination, and seedling survivorship patterns of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata in forest fragments and continuous forest. These empirical results were compared with natural patterns of recruitment in permanent 5,000\xc2\xa0m2 demographic plots adjacent to experimental areas. The number of naturally occurring seedlings established in demographic plots was 1.5\xe2\x80\x936 times greater in continuous forest than it was in 1-ha or 10-ha fragments. This result mirrors the pattern of seedling establishment in experimental transects, in which seeds in fragments were 3\xe2\x80\x937 times less likely to become established than those in continuous forest. Predation of experimentally sown seeds was extremely low at all sites, and is therefore not responsible for the observed pattern. Instead, reductions in seedling abundance in forest fragments are probably due to lower levels of seed germination. Forest fragments have higher air and soil temperatures, lower relative humidity, and increased leaf-litter accumulation, all of which can alter the cues used to initiate germination. While the growth of seedlings was similar in forest fragments and continuous forest, seedling survivorship in fragments was highly variable. These results suggest that altered environmental conditions may exacerbate reductions in plant recruitment resulting from modified plant-animal interactions. Strategies aimed at reducing the intensity of abiotic edge effects should therefore be incorporated into plant conservation efforts.'

Title: 'Carbon Sequestration Potential of Indian Forests'

Abstract: 'The forestry sector can not only sustain its carbon but also has the potential to absorb carbon from the atmosphere. India has maintained approximately 64 Mha of forest cover for the last decade. The rate of afforestation in India is one of the highest among the tropical countries, currently estimated to be 2 Mha per annum. The annual productivity has increased from 0.7 m3 per hactare in 1985 to 1.37 m3 per hectare in 1995. Increase in annual productivity directly indicates an increase in forest biomass and hence higher carbon sequestration potential. The carbon pool for the Indian forests is estimated to be 2026.72 Mt for the year 1995. Estimates of annual carbon uptake increment suggest that our forests and plantations have been able to remove at least 0.125 Gt of CO2 from the atmosphere in the year 1995. Assuming that the present forest cover in India will sustain itself with a marginal annual increase by 0.5 Mha in area of plantations, we can expect our forests to continue to act as a net carbon sink in future.'

Abstract: 'The species composition, abundance and colony sizes of terrestrial termites were studied in five forest habitats of Cat Tien National Park, Southern Vietnam. Twenty-four species belonging to Rhinotermitidae (1 species) and Termitidae (23 species, mostly Macrotermitinae), were found in mounds and in soil samples. The density of inhabited termite nests in different habitats averaged 68 per hectare (range 44\xe2\x80\x93106), most nests belonged to Macrotermes spp. Six mounds of dominant species (Globitermes sulphureus, Microcerotermes burmanicus, Macrotermes carbonarius, M. gilvus, M. malacensis and Hypotermes obscuriceps) were destructively sampled. The number of termites in the nests ranged from 65 000 to 3 150 000 individuals with the biomass ranging from 185 to 2440 g live weight. The abundance of foraging termites in soil and litter averaged 60 ind./m2.The total abundance of Macrotermes species alone could conservatively be estimated as 2.5 million individuals and 20.5 kg live weight per hectare. Four species dominating in the studied habitats (M. carbonarius, M. gilvus, M. malaccensis, and H. obscuriceps) belong to active litter decomposers.'

Abstract: 'We investigated the effect of forest thinning on soil nitrogen mineralization, nitrification and transformation in a Cryptomeria japonica plantation at high elevation to provide basic data for forest management. We chose four study plots for control, light, medium and heavy thinning treatment, and three sub-plots for buried bag studies at similar elevations in each treatment plot to measure the net N mineralization and nitrification rates in situ. The contents of soil inorganic N (ammonium and nitrate) were similar between treatments, but all varied with season, reaching maxima in September 2003 and 2004. The seasonal maximum net Nmin rates after four treatments were 0.182, 0.246, 0.303 and 0.560 mg\xc2\xb7kg\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xb7d\xe2\x88\x921 in 2003, and 0.242, 0.258, 0.411 and 0.671 mg\xc2\xb7kg\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xb7d\xe2\x88\x921in 2004, respectively. These estimates are approximate with the lower annual rates of N mineralization for this region. Forest thinning can enhance net N mineralization and microbial biomass carbon. The percentage of annual rates of Nmin for different levels of forest thinning compared with the control plot were 13.4%, 59.8% and 154.2% in 2003, and 0.1%, 58.8% and 157.7% in 2004 for light, medium, and heavy thinning, respectively. These differences were related to soil moisture, temperature, precipitation, and soil and vegetation types. Well-planned multi-site comparisons, both located within Taiwan and the East-Asia region, could greatly improve our knowledge of regional patterns in nitrogen cycling.'

Abstract: 'North east India is considered as one of the major biodiversity hotspots worldwide and centre of origin of several plant species including Musa. Musa acuminata Colla is known to be one of the wild progenitors of cultivated bananas and plantains. Three single primer based DNA marker techniques viz., random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and directed amplification of minisatellites DNA (DAMD) were used for diversity diagnostics among 25 genotypes of wild M. acuminata collected from Meghalaya province of north east India. A total of 58 primers (26-RAPD, 21-ISSR, and11-DAMD) yielded 451 DNA fragments, of which 395 (87.58\xc2\xa0%) were found to be polymorphic in nature. The polymorphic information content (PIC) values were almost identical for each marker system. The resolving power of the marker system was found to be highest in RAPD (3.96) whereas ISSR resolved highest marker index (16.39) in the study. Selected amplicon data obtained through single primer amplification reactions were utilized for determination of diversity within and among the populations of M. acuminata. Nei\xe2\x80\x99s genetic differentiation (Gst) value (0.451) indicated higher proportion of the genetic variation within the populations which is supported by the AMOVA analysis (88\xc2\xa0%). The study provides insight into the efficacy of RAPD, ISSR and DAMD to analyse the genetic variation existing in the wild Musa germplasm, which can further\xc2\xa0be exploited for quality trait improvement and domestication of such important horticultural crops. The genetic diversity based population structure may shed light on the genetic basis of speciation and evolution of various species within the genus Musa.'

Abstract: 'Fish distribution in relation to environmental variables was investigated in the Matla River of Sundarban estuarine system. A total of 64 brackish water species belonging to 38 families showing tropical and subtropical affinities were obtained upon monthly sampling of 1\xc2\xa0year. The most abundant species were Harpadon nehereus, Gudusia chapra, Coilia neglecta, Coilia ramcarati and Liza parsia. Fish assemblages showed significant seasonal variation as was revealed from MANOVA. MDS ordination plot based on similarity in the fish assemblages revealed that premonsoonal season was distinguishable from the monsoonal and postmonsoonal seasons. Notable differences were also evident between monsoon and postmonsoon. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that salinity, acidity, inorganic phosphate concentration and dissolved oxygen were the most important environmental variables in determining the observed variation in fish assemblages. Seasonal succession of fish populations may be related to differences in life cycle and adaptation to prevalent ecological conditions. The study therefore suggests that environmental variations in terms of changing salinity and dissolved oxygen have significant influence in structuring estuarine piscine community in this region.'

Abstract: 'High densities of people living around protected areas (PAs) in South Asia require management strategies to balance conservation goals and livelihood needs. Based on a survey of 777 households around five PAs in India and Nepal, this paper provides a comparative perspective of Indian and Nepali households\xe2\x80\x99 views of protected area benefits and costs, their attitude toward conservation in general, and attitude toward protected area staff. Results indicate mixed responses towards tourism, varying from very favorable in Nepal to less favorable in India. The majority (81%) held positive attitudes towards the existence and importance of PAs but had negative perceptions of PA staff (69%). Most residents perceived benefits from access to fuel wood, fodder and other PA resources including benefits from tourism, while crop and livestock losses from wildlife were the main costs. Households overall positive attitudes towards the PAs and conservation despite high losses from living around PAs suggests that local residents may support conservation if their livelihood needs are met. Comparisons of household attitudes and perceptions suggest that locally based strategies rather than top-down approaches are likely to be more effective. Extending PA benefits to smaller landholders, households that are highly resource-dependent or experiencing higher income losses from human-wildlife conflicts, and less educated residents are particularly important to balance costs and losses from living around protected areas.'

Abstract: 'Medicinal plants have been used by marginal communities to treat various ailments. However, the potential of endophytes within these bio-prospective medicinal plants remains unknown. The present study elucidates the endophytic diversity of medicinal plants (Caralluma acutangula, Rhazya stricta, and Moringa peregrina) and the endophyte role in seed growth and oxidative stress. Various organs of medicinal plants yielded ten endophytes, which were identified as Phoma sp. (6 isolates), Alternaria sp. (2), Bipolaris sp. (1), and Cladosporium sp. (1) based on 18S rDNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The culture filtrates (CFs; 25%, 50%, and 100% concentrations) from these endophytes were tested against the growth of normal and dwarf mutant rice lines. Endophytic CF exhibited dose-dependent growth stimulation and suppression effects. CF (100%) of Phoma sp. significantly increased rice seed germination and growth compared to controls and other endophytes. This growth-promoting effect was due to the presence of indole acetic acid in endophytic CF. The gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis showed the highest indole acetic acid content ((54.31\xc2\xb10.21) \xce\xbcmol/L) in Bipolaris sp. In addition, the isolate of Bipolaris sp. exhibited significantly higher radical scavenging and anti-lipid peroxidation activity than the other isolates. Bipolaris sp. and Phoma sp. also exhibited significantly higher flavonoid and phenolic contents. The medicinal plants exhibited the presence of bio-prospective endophytic strains, which could be used for the improvement of crop growth and the mitigation of oxidative stresses.'

Abstract: 'The present study was aimed to evaluate adaptive mechanism in terms of seed characters of Phyllanthus amarus collected from ten different locations of Tamil Nadu, India. The adaptive variations among the collected populations were assessed based on the sink and float percentages of the seeds in water, the percentage of seed germination, total protein, carbohydrates and their seedling\xe2\x80\x99s growth ability such as shoot and root lengths. From this, we observed that the population had a significantly higher germination percentage of sinking seeds that were attributed to its relatively higher carbohydrate and protein contents than the floating seeds. A comparison of the seed population by cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis showed that the Chennai population constituted a single clade that was very distinct from the other nine populations, which were further grouped into two sub-clusters. They exhibited a trend consistent with their geographical proximity. Standardised Mantel\xe2\x80\x99s t tests had revealed that the adaptive diversity of the P. amarus population was significantly affected by the geographic distance (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.78, t\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892.68, P\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x890.001), altitude (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.35, t\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8921.53, P\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x890.05), minimum temperature (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.43, t\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.49, P\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x890.01) and maximum temperature (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.49, t\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.67, P\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x890.001). Seed\xe2\x80\x99s characteristics and geographical conditions were correlated along with 19 bioclimatic variables. In dry season, the seedling\xe2\x80\x99s rooting ability showed positive correlation, while its protein content exhibited a negative correlation. It is clearly evident from this study that the geographical variables significantly influence the adaptive ability of the P. amarus.'

Abstract: 'India is the world\xe2\x80\x99s tenth most forested nation with 76.87\xc2\xa0M\xc2\xa0ha of forest and tree cover occupying 23.4% of its geographical area. Forests\xe2\x80\x94with their intrinsic of carbon sequestration and storage values\xe2\x80\x94are in the front line of India\xe2\x80\x99s climate change mitigation strategies. This paper provides estimates of sequestered carbon in India\xe2\x80\x99s forest and tree cover for the years 1995 and 2005 as per the IPCC good practice guidelines method. It is based on the primary data for the soil carbon pool through collecting soil samples by laying out quadrats across the country and secondary data for the growing stock of all forest and tree cover in the country. The estimates are compared with current and future projected emissions. It is found that conservation policies have resulted in increase of the country\xe2\x80\x99s forest carbon stocks from 6244.8 to 6621.6 Mt with an annual increment of 37.7 Mt of the carbon from 1995 to 2005. Annual CO2 removal by the forests is enough to neutralise 9.3% of the country\xe2\x80\x99s 2000 level emissions. Continued removals by the forest and tree cover would offset 6.5 and 4.9% of India\xe2\x80\x99s projected annual emissions in 2010 and 2020 respectively. Economically, the annual value of this forest carbon in the international market is about US $188 million. The result is of use in the REDD and REDD+ context for India.'

Abstract: "One of the last primitive island ecosystems in the Indian Ocean has been invaded since 1969 by the Sri Lankan privet, Ligustrum robustum. L. robustum is still spreading in the forests of La R\xc3\xa9union Island, where only 30% of the original vegetation remains, but where 98% of the primary native vegetation of the Mascarene Islands still exists. On Mauritius, where L. robustum was introduced about 1895, it now forms dense, impenetrable thickets, and its presence has been correlated with the inability of native vegetation to re-establish. We assessed the potential impacts of L. robustum invasion on the native ecosystems of La R\xc3\xa9union and identified the factors of invasibility. We determined the degree of invasion in 12 plots of 156 m2 and followed native flora and privet recruitment for 3 years in 12 seedling plots of 39 m2. The data show that monocultural L. robustum stands now exist in human-disturbed primary forest patches (3.3 individuals/m2 and 80% of total individuals) and high seedling densities (0.3\xe2\x80\x930.6/m2) occur in the least disturbed patches. L. robustum's rapid growth, high shade tolerance and seed production, bird-assisted seed dispersal and high seedling recruitment contribute to its invasiveness in intact forests. The conservation of the original ecosystems of La R\xc3\xa9union depends on the setting up of a long-term and immediate global control strategy."

Abstract: 'Indian fisheries is increasingly contributing to the nutritional security of the country, with the present production of fish and shellfish from capture fisheries and aquaculture being over 7.8 million\xc2\xa0tonnes. The country also has an important role in global fisheries as the second largest producer of fish in the world and higher enhancement levels as compared to world fish production levels. Further, with an annual yield of over 4.8 million\xc2\xa0tonnes from the inland fisheries sector, India is next only to China in the area. Increase in production of finfish and shellfish from 0.75 million\xc2\xa0tonnes in 1950\xe2\x80\x931951 to 7.8 million\xc2\xa0tonnes during 2010\xe2\x80\x932011, demonstrating a ten fold increase in the last five decades, is a testimony to the contributions of the sector. The share of inland fisheries sector, which was 29% in 1950\xe2\x80\x931951, has gone up to over 55% at present.'

Abstract: 'Seeds of Strychnos nux-vomica have slow and erratic germination; thus different presowing treatments were applied to enhance the germination of its seeds collected from Tamaraikulam, Tamil Nadu, India. In addition, the effects of desiccation and different storage conditions on the germination of S. nux-vomica seeds were investigated. The results show that soaking in 500\xc2\xa0ppm gibberellic acid (GA3) for 24\xc2\xa0h, incubation of seeds at 40\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C for 3\xc2\xa0days and alternate water soaking (16\xc2\xa0h) and drying (8\xc2\xa0h) for 14\xc2\xa0days significantly increased the percentage germination compared to the control. Desiccation of seeds down to 10% moisture content resulted in better germination. Germination of S. nux-vomica seeds differed significantly between different storage periods, moisture contents of the seed and for first and second order interactions (p<0.001). The highest germination (92%) was achieved when seeds with 10% moisture content were stored at ambient temperature for 30\xc2\xa0weeks. Evidence from the present study indicates that S. nux-vomica seeds possess physiological dormancy that can be broken effectively by after-ripening. As seeds of S. nux-vomica are found to be desiccation tolerant, dry seed (10% moisture content) can be hermitically stored at ambient temperature for 30\xc2\xa0weeks without losing their viability.'

Abstract: 'Tropical and subtropical hilly vegetation in Himalayan regions are well suited for the taxonomical research because of the diverse habitat available in close proximity and the regions promote high species richness and endemism due to variation in slopes, soils, rocks, microclimate, exposure, latitude and altitude. Pteridophytes have evolved to fill the ecological niche between the angiosperms and the gymnosperms. During the course of recent study towards the pteridophytes of Nokrek Biosphere Reserve in eastern Himalaya, a few new taxa are described and geographical distribution extension of several previously reported species have also come to light. Studies based mainly on collections made during the last 6\xc2\xa0 years have resulted in the revised description of the 19 species of lycophyta and ferns viz. Asplenium gueinzianum, Argostemma perakense, Asplenium sinense, Cyclosorus crinipes, Diplazium pseudosetigerum, Hymenasplenium cheilosorum, Lemmaphyllum microphyllum, , Lemmaphyllum rostratum, Loxogramme chinensis, Lygodium microphyllum, Microlepia hancei, Microlepia rhomboidia, Neocheiropteris zippelii, Pleopeltis macrosphaera, Pseudocyclosorus falcilobus, Pteris cadieri var. hainanensis, Pyrrosia lanceolata, Pyrrosia longifolia and Tectaria paradoxa from the Meghalaya state recorded for the first time. Full species citations, taxonomic notes, phenology time, chromosome counts, ecology, specimen studied, previously known distributions and citation records are given for all taxa. Recent collections show the richness of the flora of Meghalaya and permit more accurate taxonomic and phytogeographic comparisons with lycophyta and fern flora from adjacent areas.'

Abstract: 'When a natural group of plants has over many years been comprehensively and intensively studied, a large body of data, analysis and evaluation has accumulated. It is in the nature of such work on the taxonomy of such a group that this information is to be found scattered in various publications, such as research papers, checklists, monographs, Floras and other compilations. As time and research progress, some of this information will become outdated and superseded by new publications, but other information remains current and valuable. To give a review of this can provide us not only with a guide to this resource, but also with an introduction to the group in question. It may stimulate new research, as inevitably we will find that all has not been said and done, even about a group so well studied as the conifers. I hope that this paper will meet these aims.'

Abstract: 'India\xe2\x80\x99s growing self-sufficiency in food production and food stocks since independence suggest that soils have the capacity to produce. Therefore, a review of Indian soils and their capacity to sequester carbon; and the factors favouring C sequestration under different land uses is in order. Several researchers, especially those in The National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning and the International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics monitored the changes in soil organic (SOC) and inorganic (SIC) carbon as influenced by land use in the Indo-Gangetic Alluvial Plains and black soil regions between 1980 and 2005. The results showed an increase in SOC stocks due to turnover of greater plant biomass into the soil. Results of long-term fertilizer experiments with rice-based double or triple cropping systems indicate soil\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to store greater C, and maintain higher C in passive pools and that active fraction of soil C can be used as an indicator of soil health. The inclusion of active pool/labile SOC is expected to improve the performance of Century eco-system model in predicting SOC changes under different climatic conditions. Greenhouse gas emissions from the tropical Indian soils (both zeolitic and non-zeolitic) do not seem to contribute significantly to the global warming potential. The application NPK plus FYM emerged as a cost effective technology for Indian farmers. In view of the potential of C sequestration by major zeolitic and non-zeolitic soils, the present SOC stock of about 30\xc2\xa0Pg can be further increased.'

Abstract: 'The primary objective of this study is to estimate publics\xe2\x80\x99 willingness to pay (WTP) for environment conservation and analyze factors influencing WTP. A questionnaire survey based on the contingent valuation method (CVM) was carried out at Kanas Nature Reserve, Xinjiang, China. Seventy-three percent of the 412 respondents were willing to pay at different levels, and the mean WTP value was RMB 54.60 ($8.03). The results of this survey struck an optimistic note that publics were willing to contribute to improve environmental quality. Logistic regression analysis was employed to compare the characteristics of those who were and were not willing to pay. Chi-square tests were administered to identify the relationships between various explanatory factors and WTP. Conclusions and implications of the empirical study can be provided to policy makers and site managers. In a wider sense, the findings of this study should make a good contribution to the literature related to WTP for environment conservation of natural attractions.'

Abstract: 'As forests undergo natural succession following artificial afforestation, their bird assemblages also change. However, interspecific avian social organization associated with forest succession has not been fully understood, particularly for mixed-species bird flocks. To disentangle how mixed-species flocks change as a function of local forest structure, we analyzed flock characteristics (particularly species richness, flocking frequency and propensity) and vegetation physiognomies along a presumed successional series (early, middle, and advanced) simultaneously in subtropical forests in southern China. As hypothesized, monthly point counts demonstrated that complexity of flocks increases with the progression of natural forest succession at a local scale. Advanced forests differed significantly from pioneering plantations with respect to vegetation structure, flock characteristics and constituents (especially for understory specialists). Importantly, forest succession affected flock patterns particularly in relation to the flocking propensity of regular species, and the frequency of nuclear species (Huet\xe2\x80\x99s fulvetta Alcippe hueti), which in turn determined flocking occurrence at different successional stands. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that understory flocking species (mainly Timaliidae babblers) were significantly associated with intact native canopy cover, complex DBH diversity, as well as high densities of dead trees and large trees, representing a maturity level of successional stands. Our study reveals that the effect of natural forest succession on mixed-species bird flocks is species-specific and guild-dependent. From a conservation perspective, despite a high proliferation of pine plantation in southern China, priority should be placed on protecting the advanced forest with a rich collection of understory flocking specialists.'

Abstract: 'Estimation of spatial plant distribution of a large area is very tedious and time consuming assignment. In this regard, herbaria of the world are supposed to be the excellent repositories of the plant collections for reference purpose. But many repositories of the world do not have the associated information of the collections and thus it becomes a muddle for future studies. The aim of this study is to know the extent of this mess. Therefore, spatial distribution of Berberidaceae members in NW Himalaya was studied through available herbarium data in three herbaria at Department of Botany, University of Jammu, Janaki Ammal Herbarium, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine and Herbarium, Department of Botany, Punjabi University. It is observed that the collected specimens in aforesaid herbaria are correctly identified; but simultaneously, proper collection sites and collection dates are not mentioned for some specimens. Therefore, it is difficult to recollect the species. This is also revealed that India harbours 04 genera (Berberis, Epimedium, Mahonia and Nandina) and 22 species of the Berberidaceae, out of which 02 (Berberis and Mahonia) are reported from the NW Himalaya.'

Abstract: 'Open sun drying (OSD) is most common method of kokum drying in Western Ghats of India. Crop temperature, around the crop, solar temperature and rate of moisture evaporation are the important parameters of OSD of kokum. In this paper, an attempt has been made to study the OS drying characteristics of kokum rind, i.e., moisture content versus time, drying rate versus moisture content and moisture ratio versus drying time. The convective heat transfer coefficient operating in open sun drying conditions (natural convection) of kokum rind has also been determined based on the values of constants, C and n, which were obtained by linear regression analysis from experimental data for kokum rind. The quality parameters of kokum rind, i.e., acidity, pH, reducing sugar, non-reducing sugar, protein, carbohydrates, ash, anthocyanins, color (L, a and b value) and calorific value before OSD and after OSD of kokum rind have also be determined.'

Abstract: 'Many animals use multimodal (both visual and acoustic) components in courtship signals. The acoustic communication of anuran amphibians can be masked by the presence of environmental background noise, and multimodal displays may enhance receiver detection in complex acoustic environments. In the present study, we measured sound pressure levels of concurrently calling males of the Small Torrent Frog (Micrixalus saxicola) and used acoustic playbacks and an inflatable balloon mimicking a vocal sac to investigate male responses to controlled unimodal (acoustic) and multimodal (acoustic and visual) dynamic stimuli in the frogs\xe2\x80\x99 natural habitat. Our results suggest that abiotic noise of the stream does not constrain signal detection, but males are faced with acoustic interference and masking from conspecific chorus noise. Multimodal stimuli elicited greater response from males and triggered significantly more visual signal responses than unimodal stimuli. We suggest that the vocal sac acts as a visual cue and improves detection and discrimination of acoustic signals by making them more salient to receivers amidst complex biotic background noise.'

Abstract: ' Macrobrachium rosenbergii is an aquaculture species of global importance whose production has sharply declined since 2005. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in transcribed sequences are likely to have high association with economic traits and are important for marker assisted selection. SNPs were mined in 34 reported transcripts from 4 wild M. rosenbergii stocks of India using the amplicon approach and high-throughput sequencing platforms. Out of 320 SNPs detected, 134 were common to all stocks while 3 were diagnostic. Pair-wise Nei\xe2\x80\x99s genetic distances (0.304\xe2\x80\x930.469) showed phylogeny consistent with geographical distribution. AMOVA analysis revealed estimated variance of 21.5 among populations. The transition to transversion ratio was 2.20. Changes in amino acid classes and peptide stability were recorded for 80 non-synonymous SNPs while change in codon preference was noted for 138 synonymous ones. Four pathogen defence genes were highly polymorphic, of which lectin 3 had the highest SNP rate (6 SNPs/100\xc2\xa0bp). This approach for mining SNPs and using them for population differentiation in a single step is reported for the first time.'

Abstract: 'Cost-effective, fibrinolytic agents possessing least or no antigenic properties are much in demand for their prospective use as clot busters in thrombolytic therapy. The present communication explores the potential of 22 endophytic Botryosphaeria species isolated from stem of Aegle marmelos for their fibrinolytic potential. Only nine fungal isolates exhibited proteolytic activity out of which only four possessed plasminogen-independent fibrinolytic activity. The endophytic fungal isolate #1088 AMSTITYEL showed maximum in vitro proteolytic and fibrinolytic activity with a halo formation of 153.86 and 113.04\xc2\xa0mm2, respectively. The partially purified protein exhibited a fibrinolytic activity equivalent to 6.51 U/ml of plasmin. SDS\xe2\x80\x93PAGE of the dialysed fraction of #1088 AMSTITYEL resolved into six bands ranging from 26 to 80\xc2\xa0kDa. Fibrin zymogram exhibited that a single band of molecular size ~80 KDa possessing the fibrinolytic activity. Furthermore, the bioactive isolate #1088 AMSTITYEL was identified as Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae using classical and molecular taxonomic tools.'

Abstract: ' Garcinia gummi-gutta (L.) Roxb. (Clusiaceae) is an endemic, semidomesticated, fruit-yielding tree species distributed in the Western Ghats of India and Sri Lanka. Various bioactive phytochemicals, such as garcinol, benzophenones and xanthones are isolated from G. gummi-gutta and have shown antibacterial, antiviral and antioxidant activities. We sequenced the total genomic DNA using Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform and examined 241,141,804 bp high quality data, assembled into 773,889 contigs. In these contigs, 27,313 simple-sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified, among which mononucleotide repeats were predominant (44.98%) followed by dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats. Primers were designed for 9964 microsatellites among which 32 randomly selected SSR primer pairs were standardized for amplification. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA in 30 G. gummi-gutta genotypes revealed polymorphic information content (PIC) across all 32 loci ranging from 0.867 to 0.951, with a mean value of 0.917. The observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.00 to 0.63 and 0.896 to 0.974, respectively. Alleles per locus ranged from 12 to 27. This is the first report on the development of genomic SSR markers in G. gummi-gutta using next-generation sequencing technology. The genomic SSR markers developed in this study will be useful in identification, mapping, diversity and breeding studies.'

Abstract: 'Fungal endophytes isolated from leaves of tree species of the forests of Western Ghats, southern India were screened for chitin modifying enzyme production. Thirty-one of the one hundred and sixty two isolates were positive for chitinase, while different isolates produced isoforms of the enzyme. Many isolates produced chitosanase that acted on chitosan with different degrees of acetylation. Modified chitin and different types of chitosans are used in biomedical applications including wound healing, drug delivery, gene delivery, tissue engineering, in the food industry as preservatives and emulsifying agents, and in biocatalysis. Horizontally transmitted endophytes appear to be a good source for a variety of chitin modifying enzymes with the potential to be used in biotechnology. The possibility of chitin modifying enzymes of endophytes in regulating plant defense against pathogens and pests in vivo should also be addressed.'

Abstract: 'The need to carry out biological conservation outside protected areas requires avoiding, minimizing or mitigating impacts brought about by habitat transformation upon the biota. Usually, forest plantations hold fewer species than the original forest. However, structurally complex plantations support more species and individuals than simpler ones. Here we test if this phenomenon occurs in amphibian and reptilian assemblages, analyzing information regarding their richness and abundance in forestry plantations from 14 countries and 72 case studies which compare species richness and abundance in plantations and forests. Among amphibians, species richness is lower in plantations than in forests while among reptiles there is no significant difference. The abundance of reptiles increases in plantations. Three studies dealt with reptile assemblages in relation to structural complexity of plantation, which suggest that species richness and abundance is higher in complex plantations. Despite accounting for 50\xc2\xa0% of the terrestrial vertebrates, herpetological studies account for 15\xc2\xa0% of the research available regarding the impact of plantation upon vertebrates, information deficiency that hampers decision-making on the conservation of herpetozoans outside protected areas.'

Abstract: 'Modern pollen-vegetation relationship has been analyzed in respect to vegetational distribution and pollen dispersal from sub-alpine and alpine ecological regimes within the higher reaches of the Gangotri glacier valley. The results in general cope with the local ecological conditions of the sites within the valley. Above the tree line limits, the pollen frequency of arboreal taxa is found lower than those of non-arboreal taxa. In contrast the pine-birch forest area at Chirbasa represented the frequency of arboreal pollen (AP) more than that of non-arboreal pollen (NAP) due to over representation of Pinus wallichiana (conifer). Pollen grains of extra-local arboreal elements, mostly conifers have also been recorded here with fair amount of temperate broad-leaved arboreal taxa viz. Quercus, Alnus, Corylus, Carpinus, Ulmus, Juglans etc. that have been transported by the upthermic winds from their growing limits at lower altitudes to the study sites at higher altitudes. Non-arboreal taxa viz. marshy/aquatic, steppe and of other herbaceaous taxa, represents the existing ecological regimes of their respective sites within the valley. Differential pollen preservation has been observed between the moss cushion and sediment samples from the same site that may be due to the direct exposure of moss cushions to air, thus showing more concentration of wind pollinated pollen-spores as compared to surface sediments.'

Abstract: 'Sequential chemical extractions were used to study the spatial and temporal distribution of different forms of phosphorus (P) in the surface sediments of Chilika, the largest brackish water lake in Indian subcontinent. Sediments were analyzed for different forms of phosphorus along with some sedimentary parameters such as sand, mud, and organic carbon. The lake sediments are found to be mostly sandy near outer channel, whereas other parts of the lake are muddy sand type. Among the inorganic phosphorous fractions, calcium-bound P (Ca-P) emerged as the most dominant fraction contributing 55 and 37\xc2\xa0% of the total phosphorous (TP) respectively in pre- and post-monsoon seasons, respectively. Contribution of loosely bound phosphorus (Lo-P) to the TP in lake system was the lowest (<1\xc2\xa0%) in both the seasons. TP concentration of the lake sediment ranged from 291.9 to 1653.4\xc2\xa0mg/kg with an average of 1047.71\xc2\xa0mg/kg in pre-monsoon and 243.97\xe2\x80\x932150.55\xc2\xa0mg/kg with an average of 1100.81\xc2\xa0mg/kg in post-monsoon seasons. The bioavailable fraction contributes 1.4\xe2\x80\x9326.7\xc2\xa0% with average of 23.8\xc2\xa0% in pre-monsoon whereas it contributes 32.1\xe2\x80\x9334.32\xc2\xa0% with an average of 35.72\xc2\xa0% of TP in post-monsoon. The order of abundance of the major forms of P in the surface sediments of Chilika Lake was as follows: Lo-P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89Al-P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89Fe-P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89O-P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89Ca-P for both the seasons. Correlation matrix and factor analysis were used for result interpretation.'

Abstract: 'The study aims at evaluating the various drought indices for the humid, semi-arid and arid regions of India using conventional indices, such as rainfall anomaly index, departure analysis of rainfall and other indices such as Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) and Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) that were analyzed using the DrinC software. In SPI, arid region has seven drought years, whereas humid and semi-arid regions have four. In case of RDI, the humid and semi-arid regions have 11 drought years, whereas arid regions have 10\xc2\xa0years. The difference in SPI and RDI was due to the fact that RDI considered potential evapotranspiration, and hence, correlation with plants would be better in case of RDI. Humid region showed a decreasing trend in initial value of RDI during the drought as compared to semiarid and arid regions and indicated possible climate change impact in these regions. Among all the indices, RDI was considered as an effective indicator because of implicit severity and high prediction matches with the actual drought years. SPI and RDI were found to be well correlated with respect to 3\xc2\xa0months rainfall data and SPI values led to prediction of annual RDI. The results of our study established that this correlation could be used for developing disaster management plan well in advance to combat the drought consequences.'

Title: 'Depositional environment and faunal assemblages of the reef-associated beachrock at Rameswaram and Keelakkarai Group of Islands, Gulf of Mannar, India'

Abstract: 'Reef-associated beachrocks from Rameswaram and Keelakkarai group of islands (Holocene) were studied to assess the depositional environment and faunal assemblages. The samples were collected from marine terraces and reef platforms. Granulometrically, they are coarse to medium grained, moderately to very well sorted and fine to very fine skewed in character. The fineskewed nature of the sediments suggests the prevalence of the environmental condition of low energy. The microfaunas associated in beachrock reflect the reefal environment of deposition. Bivariant plots show that the sediments were predominantly deposited under beach environment. The C-M pattern indicates that the sediments are deposited by rolling and graded suspension. The Visher diagram of the study area samples clearly shows the presence of a dominant single saltation, lack of population and no surface creep population. The low diversity and fair preservation of faunas reflect the transgressive phase and the shallow marine environmental condition. The commonly preserved species such as Quinqueloculina sp. and Triloculina sp. indicate the low-energy environmental conditions.'

Abstract: 'Understanding the spatial patterns of species distribution is essential to characterize the structure of communities, to optimize species inventories and to evaluate the impact of biotic and abiotic variables. Here we describe the spatial structure of the distribution of leaf litter ant species, and of biotic factors that could explain it, in a subtropical semi-deciduous forest of the Argentinian Chaco, characterized by a dense understorey of shrubs and terrestrial bromeliads. Environmental variables (leaf litter quantity and ground bromeliad density) were measured and ants were collected in 1\xc2\xa0m2 quadrats distributed along two 200\xc2\xa0m transects at intervals of 1.25\xc2\xa0m. Overall 87 species were collected. Sixteen positive associations and a single negative association were observed between the 11 most frequent species taken pair-wise. Our results suggest that the spatial distribution of leaf litter ants was determined at two different scales. At a small scale (period below 10\xc2\xa0m) a periodic spatial structure, likely due to intraspecific competition, produced a succession of peaks of abundance separated by gaps. At a larger scale (period around 50\xc2\xa0m), periodically distributed environmental factors induced aggregates of colonies of species responding positively to these factors. A high quantity of leaf litter and, to a lesser extent, a high density of ground bromeliads promoted a high density and a high species richness of ants. Numerically dominant ants being generally positively associated, interspecific competition was apparently weak. All ant species whose abundance was correlated with an environmental factor were not completely spatially structured by it. This suggests that some other factors, such as intraspecific competition, may have counter-effects.'

Abstract: 'Present study was carried out in Tirap district of Arunachal Pradesh characterized by mountainous terrain coupled with torrential rainfall. Forests and agriculture land cover are exposed to varied level of anthropogenic and deforestation activities. All these have augmented into pronounced soil erosion thereby negatively impacting the socio-economy of the rural population. Topographic, management, soil and landuse factors were among the most important drivers influencing the soil erosion. Keeping above in account, present study emphasizes the applicability of geospatial technology coupled with field data to estimate soil erosion rate which could be helpful in developing suitable management plan. Numerous empirical models are available for estimating soil erosion; however, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with geographic information system framework was applied in the current study due to its robustness and simplicity. RUSLE factors such as erosivity of rainfall (RE), erodibility of soil (ES), slope length (LS), crop management (CM) and conservation practice (CP) were calculated using available data. Rainfall erosivity factor was 323.8\xc2\xa0MJ mm/ha/h/year. ES factor ranged from 0.16 to 0.28\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0h/MJ/mm and LS factor ranges between 0 and 44.62. NDVI derived crop management factor ranges between 0 and 1.7. Conservation practice factor values ranged from 0.004 to 1. The annual soil loss was modeled using different factors of RULSE model and soil loss was predicted (1.38\xe2\x80\x9359.05 ton per hectare). Keeping threshold value of soil erosion (<\xe2\x80\x8910 ton per hectare) in account, most part of the study area is suitable for agriculture practices however, emphasis on suitable soil and water conservation measures are perquisite for sustainable environment management.'

Abstract: 'The national-scale forest recovery of Vietnam started in the early 1990s and is associated with a shift from net deforestation to net reforestation. Large disparities in forest cover dynamics are, however, observed at the local scale. This study aims to unravel the mechanisms driving forest cover change for a mountainous region located in northwest Vietnam. Statistical analyses were used to explore the association between forest cover change and household characteristics. In Sa Pa district, deforestation rates are decreasing, but forest degradation continues at similar rates. Deforestation is not necessarily associated with impoverished ethnic communities or high levels of subsistence farming, and the largest forest cover dynamics are found in villages with the best socio-economic conditions. Our empirical study does not provide strong evidence of a dominant role of agriculture in forest cover dynamics. It shows that empirical studies on local-scale forest dynamics remain important to unravel the complexity of human\xe2\x80\x93environment interactions.'

Abstract: 'Investigation of forest canopy density has become an important tool for proper management of natural resources. Vegetation cover density can identify the exact forest gaps within a particular area which in turn will provide the appropriate management strategies for future. Forest canopy density has become an essential tool for identifying the exact areas where the afforestation or reforestation programmes needs to be implemented. The aim and objective of this article is to show up the existing density of forest cover using remote sensing and geographic information system tools. Weighted overlay analysis method has been adopted for investigating forest canopy density of Sali river basin, Bankura district, West Bengal. Several indices likewise normalized difference vegetation index, bareness index, shadow index and perpendicular vegetation index etc. have been used for this study. Higher the weight was assigned for greater concentration of vegetation and lower the weight was assigned for lesser concentration of vegetation. Southern part of the region has very high density of forest coverage in comparison with the northern part of the region. It has been observed that 7.48% of the area is at very low density, 12.63% of low density, 24.84% of medium density, 23.92% of high density and 31.13% of very high forest canopy density.'

Abstract: "This study was performed to assess how local inhabitants in two tropical watersheds value forests and perceive both forests and their own capacity to influence the hydrological cycle. Both service and productivity functions were strongly valued, particularly forests' rain-bringing capacity. The view that forests are directly responsible for increased precipitation was especially strong in low rainfall areas. Forests were also seen as important for their ability to retain soil water. The human activity most often mentioned as affecting water availability was tree planting while water conservation structures were not seen as detrimentally affecting others. Water was pictured very strongly as being part of a cycle so that which is used by humans or trees is not considered lost but only displaced to return again as rain."

Abstract: 'Mercury contamination in the water bodies of developing countries is a serious concern due to its toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumulation. Vembanad, a tropical backwater lake situated at the southwest coast of India, is the largest Ramsar site in southern India. The lake supports thousands of people directly and indirectly through its resources and ecosystem services. It is highly polluted with toxic pollutants such as heavy metals, as it receives effluent discharges from Kerala\xe2\x80\x99s major industrial zone. In the present study, water, pore water, sediment, and fish samples collected from Vembanad Lake were analysed for total mercury (THg) and methyl mercury (MHg) contents. The maximum concentrations of THg and MHg in surface water samples were31.8 and 0.21\xc2\xa0ng/L, respectively, and those in bottom water samples were 206 and 1.22\xc2\xa0ng/L, respectively. Maximum concentration of THg in surface sediment was observed during monsoon season (2850\xc2\xa0ng/g) followed by that in the pre-monsoon season (2730\xc2\xa0ng/g) and the post-monsoon season (2140\xc2\xa0ng/g). The highest sediment concentration of MHg (202.02\xc2\xa0ng/g) was obtained during monsoon season. The spatial variation in the mercury contamination clearly indicates that the industrial discharge into the Periyar River is a major reason for pollution in the lake. The mercury pollution was found to be much higher in Vembanad Lake than in other wetlands in India. The bioaccumulation was high in carnivorous fishes, followed by benthic carnivores. The THg limit in fish for human consumption (0.5\xc2\xa0mg/kg dry wt.) was exceeded for all fish species, except for Glossogobius guiris and Synaptura orientalis. The concentration of THg was five times higher in Megalops cyprinoides and four times higher in Gazza minuta. Significant variation was observed among species with different habits and habitats. Overall, risk assessment factors showed that the mercury levels in the edible fishes of Vembanad Lake can pose serious health impacts to the human population.'

Abstract: 'Remote sensing can be defined as the process of measuring the physical properties of distant objects using reflected or emitted energy [1]. Remote Sensing (RS) refers to the science of identification of earth surface features and estimation of their geo-biophysical properties using electromagnetic radiation as a medium of interaction. Spectral, spatial, temporal and polarization signatures are major characteristics of the sensor/target, which facilitate target discrimination. Earth surface data as seen by the sensors in different wavelengths (reflected, scattered and/or emitted) is radiometrically and geometrically corrected before extraction of spectral information [2, 3]. Remote Sensing data, with its ability for a synoptic view, repetitive coverage with calibrated sensors to detect changes, observations at different resolutions, provides a better alternative for natural resources management as compared to traditional methods [4, 5].\n'

Abstract: 'This paper presents the first comprehensive report of the organochlorine pesticide residues (OCs) such as hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its six metabolites (DDTs), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in core sediments (<63-\xce\xbcm particle size) from the Indian Sunderban wetland. The pooled mean values of the mass fraction of \xce\xa3HCHs, HCB, and \xce\xa3DDTs in the sediments were 0.05\xe2\x80\x9312, 0.05\xe2\x80\x931.4, and 0.05\xe2\x80\x9311.5\xc2\xa0ng g\xe2\x88\x921 dry weight, respectively. The vertical distribution of pesticides reveals an erratic pattern. The concentration of four isomers of HCHs reveals a heterogenic distribution where \xce\xb3-HCH (lindane) and \xce\xb2-HCH shared the dominant part. The mass fraction of HCB did not show any sharp spatial variation. The prevailing sequence of DDT metabolites indicates an active degradation of the parent compound in the sediments and/or inputs of already degraded pp\xe2\x80\x99DDT to the region. Peak concentrations of HCH isomers and DDT metabolites have the potential to induce ecotoxicological impact as per the sediment quality guidelines.'

Title: 'Asynchronous responses of East Asian and Indian summer monsoons to mountain uplift shown by regional climate modelling experiments'

Abstract: 'It has been demonstrated in climate models that both the Indian and East Asian summer monsoons (ISM and EASM) are strengthened by the uplift of the entire Asian orography or Tibetan Plateau (TP) (i.e. bulk mountain uplift). Such an effect is widely perceived as the major mechanism contributing to the evolution of Asian summer monsoons in the Neogene. However, geological evidence suggests more diachronous growth of the Asian orography (i.e. regional mountain uplift) than bulk mountain uplift. This demands a re-evaluation of the relation between mountain uplift and the Asian monsoon in the geological periods. In this study, sensitivity experiments considering the diachronous growth of different parts of the Asian orography are performed using the regional climate model COSMO-CLM to investigate their effects on the Asian summer monsoons. The results show that, different from the bulk mountain uplift, the regional mountain uplift can lead to an asynchronous development of the ISM and EASM. While the ISM is primarily intensified by the thermal insulation (mechanical blocking) effect of the southern TP (Zagros Mountains), the EASM is mainly enhanced by the surface sensible heating of the central, northern and eastern TP. Such elevated surface heating can induce a low-level cyclonic anomaly around the TP that reduces the ISM by suppressing the lower tropospheric monsoon vorticity, but promotes the EASM by strengthening the warm advection from the south of the TP that sustains the monsoon convection. Our findings provide new insights to the evolution of the Asian summer monsoons and their interaction with the tectonic changes in the Neogene.'

Abstract: 'The present study was conducted during July 2013 (early phase of monsoon or EM) and September 2013 (later phase of monsoon or LM) to ascertain the intra-monsoonal variation on zooplankton, by selecting 15 study stations in the river Saptamukhi, one of the main estuaries in the Sundarbans Estuarine System (SES). In 2013, SES experienced an unusually high monsoonal rainfall also exacerbated by cloud burst event at Himalayan region (upper stretches of SES) which tremendously increased the river runoff. The present work was aimed to decipher the effect of this unusual precipitation during the monsoon season on zooplankton assemblages along with different hydrological parameters. The abundance of zooplankton was recorded as lower during EM compared to LM. Altogether, 56 zooplankton taxa were identified with copepods forming the predominant population. Thirty-three copepod species were reported with 25 calanoid species forming the bulk of the biomass followed by 5 and 3 species of cyclopoids and harpacticoid, respectively. A combination of multivariate cluster analysis, biotic indices, and canonical correspondence analysis revealed noticeable alterations in the zooplankton community structure across the spatio-temporal scale. Furthermore, significant intra-monsoonal changes in zooplankton population correlated with several hydrological parameters were clearly noticed. Paracalanus parvus, Bestiolina similis and Oithona similis were observed to be the most dominant copepod species in both sampling periods. The result of the present study provides new insight on estuarine zooplankton community after unusual rainfall during monsoon season, and provides further evidence to support the conservation and management of the SES ecosystem.'

Abstract: ' Saraca asoca (Roxb.) Willd, commonly known as \xe2\x80\x9cAsoka\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cAshoka,\xe2\x80\x9d is one of the most important medicinal plants used in raw herbal trade in India. The bark extracts of the tree are used in the treatment of leucorrhea and other uterine disorders besides also having anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-pyretic, anti-helminthic, and analgesic activity. The indiscriminate and rampant extraction of the wood to meet the ever-increasing market demand has led to a sharp decline in naturally occurring populations of the species in the country. Consequently, the species has recently been classified as \xe2\x80\x9cvulnerable\xe2\x80\x9d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Increasing deforestation and increasing demand for this medicinal plant have resulted in a limited supply and suspected widespread adulteration of the species in the raw herbal trade market. Adulteration is a serious concern due to: (i) reduction in the efficacy of this traditional medicine, (ii) considerable health risk to consumers, and (iii) fraudulent product substitution that impacts the economy for the Natural Health Product (NHP) Industry and consumers. In this paper, we provide the first attempt to assess the extent of adulteration in the raw herbal trade of S. asoca using DNA barcoding validated by NMR spectroscopic techniques. Analyzing market samples drawn from 25 shops, mostly from peninsular India, we show that more than 80\xc2\xa0% of the samples were spurious, representing plant material from at least 7 different families. This is the first comprehensive and large-scale study to demonstrate the widespread adulteration of market samples of S. asoca in India. These results pose grave implications for the use of raw herbal drugs, such as that of S. asoca, on consumer health and safety. Based on these findings, we argue for a strong and robust regulatory framework to be put in place, which would ensure the quality of raw herbal trade products and reassure consumer confidence in indigenous medicinal systems.'

Abstract: 'In this study, we model the long-term effect of climate change on commercially important teak (Tectona grandis) and its productivity in India. This modelling assessment is based on climate projections of the regional climate model of the Hadley Center (HadRM3) and the dynamic vegetation model, IBIS. According to the model projections, 30% of teak grids in India are vulnerable to climate change under both A2 and B2 SRES scenarios because the future climate may not be optimal for teak at these grids. However, the net primary productivity and biomass are expected to increase because of elevated levels of CO2. Given these directions of likely impacts, it is crucial to further investigate the climate change impacts on teak and incorporate such findings into long-term teak plantation programs. This study also demonstrates the feasibility and limitations of assessing the impact of projected climate change at the species level in the tropics.'

Abstract: 'This paper documents the concentration of total arsenic and individual arsenic species in four soft-bottom benthic polychaetes (Perenereis cultifera, Ganganereis sootai, Lumbrinereis notocirrata and Dendronereis arborifera) along with host sediments from Sundarban mangrove wetland, India. An additional six sites were considered exclusively for surface sediments for this purpose. Polychaetes were collected along with the host sediments and measured for their total arsenic content using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Arsenic concentrations in polychaete body tissues varied greatly, suggesting species-specific characteristics and inherent peculiarities in arsenic metabolism. Arsenic was generally present in polychaetes as arsenate (AsV ranges from 0.16 to 0.50\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921) or arsenite (AsIII ranges from 0.10 to 0.41\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921) (30\xe2\x80\x9353\xc2\xa0% as inorganic As) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV\xc2\xa0<1\xe2\x80\x9325\xc2\xa0%). Arsenobetaine (AB\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa016\xc2\xa0%), and PO4-arsenoriboside (8\xe2\x80\x9348\xc2\xa0%) were also detected as minor constituents, whilst monomethylarsonic acid (MAV) was not detected in any of the polychaetes. The highest total As (14.7\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921 dry wt) was observed in the polychaete D. arborifera collected from the vicinity of a sewage outfall in which the majority of As was present as an uncharacterised compound (10.3\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921 dry wt) eluted prior to AB. Host sediments ranged from 2.5 to 10.4\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921 of total As. This work supports the importance of speciation analysis of As, because of the ubiquitous occurrence of this metalloid in the environment, and its variable toxicity depending on chemical form. It is also the first work to report the composition of As species in polychaetes from the Indian Sundarban wetlands.'

Abstract: 'The complete mitochondrial genome of the endangered fish Tor malabaricus, (Malabar mahseer) was sequenced for the first time. The mitochondrial genome size was determined to be 16580\xc2\xa0bp in length, consisting of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNAs, 2 ribosomal RNA genes and a control region (D-loop). The overall base composition was A: 31.88%, T: 24.87%, G: 15.68% and C: 27.58%. The phylogenetic analysis of 13 protein-coding genes of available mitogenome of mahseer species showed that the T. malabaricus had closer relationship to the black mahseer T. khudree. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of T. malabaricus would contribute to the better understanding of molecular systematics, selection, conservation, species identification and evolution of this species.'

Abstract: 'Landscape ecologists typically identify boundaries to demarcate habitatpatches. The boundary between two habitat types may be abrupt, such as thetransition between a grassland and a parking lot, or more gradual, such as theshift between successional forest stages. Two key aspects of landscapeboundaries, their shape and contrast, are predicted to influence movement ofmaterials, plants, and animals. Ecological theory suggests that a patch\xe2\x80\x99sperimeter-to-area ratio should strongly influence animal emigration when patchboundaries are relatively permeable, but not when boundaries are more severe.Weinvestigated the interactive effects of patch shape and boundary contrast onmovement of ground-dwelling beetles (Carabidae and Tenebrionidae) in nativegrassland habitat at Jepson Prairie, Solano County, California, USA. Weconducted a field experiment with two patch shape treatments, square andrectangle, that held patch area constant, and two boundary contrast treatmentscreated by mowing grass surrounding each plot at two different heights. Wemonitored the number of beetles leaving each patch over a three-week periodfollowing treatment establishment. We observed a significant effect of boundarycontrast on net movement of beetles, with low contrast boundaries exhibitingnetimmigration and high contrast boundaries experiencing net emigration. Moreover,the importance of patch shape appeared to be greater for low contrast versushigh contrast boundaries, consistent with theoretical expectations. Ourcombinedobservations indicate that these ground-dwelling beetles were more likely tomove into patches that were rectangular and surrounded by a low contrast matrixthan patches that were square or surrounded by a high contrast matrix. Weconclude that net movement of beetles across patch boundaries is stronglyinfluenced by boundary contrast and may be affected by patch shape whenboundarycontrast is low.'

Abstract: 'Molecular genetic fingerprints of nine Curcuma species from Northeast India were developed using PCR-based markers. The aim involves elucidating there intra- and inter-specific genetic diversity important for utilization, management, and conservation. Twelve random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), 19 Inter simple sequence repeats (ISSRs), and four amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primers produced 266 polymorphic fragments. ISSR confirmed maximum polymorphism of 98.55% whereas RAPD and AFLP showed 93.22 and 97.27%, respectively. Marker index and polymorphic information content varied in the range of 8.64\xe2\x80\x9348.1, 19.75\xe2\x80\x9348.14, and 25\xe2\x80\x9328 and 0.17\xe2\x80\x930.48, 0.19\xe2\x80\x930.48, and 0.25\xe2\x80\x930.29 for RAPD, ISSR, and AFLP markers, respectively. The average value of number of observed alleles, number of effective alleles, mean Nei\xe2\x80\x99s gene diversity, and Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s information index were 1.93\xe2\x80\x931.98, 1.37\xe2\x80\x931.62, 0.23\xe2\x80\x930.36, and 0.38\xe2\x80\x930.50, respectively, for three DNA markers used. Dendrograms based on three molecular data using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) was congruent and classified the Curcuma species into two major clusters. Cophenetic correlation coefficient between dendrogram and original similarity matrix were significant for RAPD (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.96), ISSR (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.94), and AFLP (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.97). Clustering was further supported by principle coordinate analysis. High genetic polymorphism documented is significant for conservation and further improvement of Curcuma species.'

Abstract: 'Improving quality of life (QoL) is one of the main goals of many public policies. A useful tool to measure QoL needs to get a good balance between indicators guided by theories (top-down approach) and indicators defined by local people (bottom-up approach). However, QoL measurement tools often neglect to include elements that define the standard of living at local level. In this paper, we analyse the correspondence between human development index, as an indicator adopted by governments to assess QoL, and the elements defined by local people as important in their QoL, called here local means. Using a free-listing technique, we collected information from 114 individuals from Kodagu, Kartanataka (India), to capture local means defining QoL. We then compared local means with the indicators used by Human development report (HDR) of Karnataka, the main measurement tool of QoL in Kodagu. The list of local means included access to basic facilities and many issues related to agriculture and natural resources management as elements locally defining QoL. We also found that HDR does not capture the means defined by people as indicators of QoL. Our findings suggest an important gap between current QoL\xe2\x80\x99s indicators considered by public policies and the means of QoL defined by people. Our study provides insights for a set of plausible local indicators useful to achieve a balance between top-down and bottom-up approaches for the local public policies.'

Title: 'Changing depositional environment and factors controlling the growth of mudflat in a tropical estuary, west coast of India'

Abstract: 'Mudflats and associated mangroves are most important ecosystems of tropical coastal regions. Mangroves play a very important role in maintaining the environmental balance; thus in addition to mangrove reforestation and restoration, afforestation has also been practiced. We studied distribution of sediment components (sand, silt, clay) organic carbon (OC), heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cr and Co) and pH in six cores collected from one of the largest mudflats of Mandovi estuary, west coast of India. The temporal distribution patterns of these proxies suggested that past changes in tidal energy conditions, fresh water inflow and anthropogenic activities over the last few decades, together helped in development of a middle tidal flat in this estuary. In cores collected from the mangroves, trapping and deposition of finer particles and organic matter were enhanced by a complex aerial mangrove root system in recent years. Mangroves were, therefore, suggested to enhance the buildup of mudflats in Mandovi estuary. Cores collected from mudflats also exhibited higher deposition of finer particles and organic matter (except MF2) in recent years, suggesting maturity and greater stability of the entire mudflat in recent years. Middle tidal flats (mudflats) of Mandovi estuary may, therefore, prove to be suitable substrates for mangrove proliferation in the near future. Finer sediments deposited mainly from mining activities in recent years exhibited lower pH and higher metal content. Organisms dwelling in these recently deposited sediments are, therefore, at higher risk of bioaccumulation and metal toxicity.'

Abstract: 'Evaluation of litterfall production is important for understanding nutrient cycling, forest growth, successional pathways, and interactions with environmental variables in forest ecosystems. Litterfall was intensively studied during the period of 1982\xe2\x80\x932001 in two subtropical monsoon vegetation gradients in the Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve, Guangdong Province, China. The two gradients include: (1) a successional gradient composed of pine forest (PF), mixed pine and broadleaved forest (MF) and monsoon evergreen broadleaved forest (BF), and (2) an altitudinal gradient composed of Baiyunci ravine rain forest (BRF), Qingyunci ravine rain forest (QRF), BF and mountainous evergreen broadleaved forest (MMF). Mean annual litterfall production was 356, 861 and 849\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 for PF, MF and BF of the successional gradient, and 1016, 1061, 849 and 489\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 for BRF, QRF, BF and MMF of the altitudinal gradient, respectively. As expected, mean annual litterfall of the pioneer forest PF was the lowest, but rapidly increased over the observation period while those in other forests were relatively stable, confirming that forest litterfall production is closely related to successional stages and growth patterns. Leaf proportions of total litterfall in PF, MF, BF, BRF, QRF and MMF were 76.4%, 68.4%, 56.8%, 55.7%, 57.6% and 69.2%, respectively, which were consistent with the results from studies in other evergreen broadleaved forests. Our analysis on litterfall monthly distributions indicated that litterfall production was much higher during the period of April to September compared to other months for all studied forest types. Although there were significant impacts of some climate variables (maximum and effective temperatures) on litterfall production in some of the studied forests, the mechanisms of how climate factors (temperature and rainfall) interactively affect litterfall await further study.'

Abstract: 'Eight accessions of swordbean (Canavalia gladiata (Jacq.) DC.) were collected from eight agroclimatic regions of Tamil Nadu, India. A portion of the collected seeds of accessions will be deposited in NBPGR, New Delhi. The most pronounced differences in agrobotanical characters were observed in seed germination percentage, plant height, number of branches per plant, number of leaves (180th day) per plant, leaf area (150th day), early flowering, fertility index and 100-seed-weight. Differences in the contents of crude protein and crude lipid in the seeds of different accessions also appeared to be significant. Performance of Lowerkodiyar and Mundanthurai accessions under test conditions was superior and suggested that breeders might exploit the genome of these accessions in current pulse crop improvement programmes.'

Abstract: 'To address paucity of the mycorrhizal studies in bamboo, we have investigated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) distribution and dark septate endophyte (DSE) colonization on four species of bamboo from Northeast India. Bambusa tulda exhibits Arum type of AMF morphology, and other bamboo species have Paris type. AMF colonization was significantly higher than DSE colonization (P<0.05). Vesicular and DSE colonization exhibit a significant positive correlation with organic carbon and available phosphorus, respectively (P<0.05). Of 17 species isolated from Acaulospora, Ambispora and Glomus, 12 were isolated from Phyllostachys manii. Acaulospora tuberculata, A. rehmii, Glomus intraradices and G. tortuosum were the most frequently distributed species. Shannon diversity index was the highest in P. manii. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots and cluster analysis suggest that P. manii was the most dissimilar bamboo species in terms of mycorrhizal colonization and soil properties.'

Abstract: 'Gloriosa superba (L.) of the family Colchicaceae is a tuberous endangered plant, rich in several bioactive compounds like alkaloids and sterols. The tubers of the plant have medicinal value and are used to treat inflammation, skin infections, rheumatoid arthritis and other ailments. Since large-scale exploitation of the plant is detrimental to the biodiversity, the compounds obtained from other sources, especially the endophytes, which are known to produce the same bioactive compounds as that of the host plants are looked for. The endophytic fungi from roots, stem and leaves were isolated and identified based on morphotyping and ITS\xe2\x80\x93DNA sequences. A total of 233 isolates were recovered from a total of 450 segments of root, stem and leaf. A large and diverse number of endophytic fungi were recovered from roots when compared to other parts of the plant. Bipolaris cynodontis, B. specifera, Fusarium oxysporum and F. solani were found as dominant colonizers of root in addition to Talaromyces pinophilus, Oidiodendron spp. and Colletotrichum gleosporioides. The isolated endophytes belonged to seven morphotypes: a majority of them were Hyphomycetes (65.21%), followed by Dothideomycetes (13.04%), Coelomycetes (8.69%), Sordariomycetes (4.34%), Eurotiomycetes (4.34%), Leotiomycetes (4.34%) and Zygomycetes (4.34%). The colonization frequency was found to be high in roots followed by stem and leaves. These endophytes could be exploited for screening novel secondary metabolites which can be used as therapeutic agents.'

Abstract: 'Comprehensive transcriptome analysis of leaf and root tissues of Nothapodytes nimmoniana unravels several putative pathway genes, transcription factors and CYPs related to camptothecin (CPT) biosynthesis. Additionally, post-transcriptional suppression by artificial microRNA (aMIR) of NnCYP76B6 (geraniol 10-hydroxylase) suggests its role in CPT biosynthesis. Tissue-specific LC-MS/MS analysis revealed the presence of secologanin as the central intermediate of MIA pathway in N. nimmoniana.'

Abstract: 'The present study aimed to assess the potentiality of water soluble fungal pigments for dyeing on cotton yarn. Five different shades of pigments were extracted from Monascus purpureus, Isaria farinosa, Emericella nidulans, Fusarium verticillioides, and Penicillium purpurogenum using ethanol. Maximum concentration of pigment was obtained from Monascus purpureus (red, 25.02\xc2\xb11.6 UA) followed by Penicillium purpurogenum (yellow, 23.05\xc2\xb10.3 UA). The optimum dyeing condition was observed at a pigment concentration of 1 gram, pH 5, temperature 80 \xc2\xb0C, time duration 90 min, and a liquor ratio of 1:30 was found to be the optimal for dyeing. Maximum uptake of 80 % was achieved with Monascus purpureus red pigment. Moreover, the effect of mordant in dyeing was evaluated by different mordanting methods. A strong variation in shade and color depth could be achieved by using pre-mordanting method with alum and ferrous sulfate giving better wash fastness properties when compared with post-mordanting or without a mordant.'

Abstract: 'Remote sensing data and Geographical Information System (GIS) has been integrated with the weighted index overlay (WIO) method and E 30 model for the identification and delineation of soil erosion susceptibility zones and the assessment of rate of soil erosion in the mountainous sub-watershed of River Manimala in Kerala (India). Soil erosion is identified as the one of the most serious environmental problems in the human altered mountainous environment. The reliability of estimated soil erosion susceptibility and soil loss is based on how accurately the different factors were estimated or prepared. In the present analysis, factors that are considered to be influence the soil erosion are: land use/land cover, NDVI, landform, drainage density, drainage frequency, lineament frequency, slope, and relative relief. By the WIO analysis, the area is divided into zones representing low (33.30%), moderate (33.70%), and high (33%) erosion proneness. The annual soil erosion rate of the area under investigation was calculated by carefully determining its various parameters and erosion for each of the pixels were estimated individually. The spatial pattern thus created for the area indicates that the average annual rate of soil erosion in the area was ranging from 0.04\xc2\xa0mm\xc2\xa0yr\xe2\x88\x921 to 61.80\xc2\xa0mm\xc2\xa0yr\xe2\x88\x921. The high soil erosion probability and maximum erosion rate was observed in areas with high terrain alteration, high relief and slopes with the intensity and duration of heavy precipitation during the monsoons.'

Abstract: 'Significant variations in the multivariate morphometric analysis were observed in the sub-populations of freshwater murrel, Channa punctatus from two habitats characterized by different environmental conditions. A linear relationship was noted between different body measurements and total length of the fish in both the environments. The 14 morphometric parameters found to be significant (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) in univariate (one way ANOVA) analysis were further subjected to multivariate analysis using principal component and discriminant function analysis. Principal component analysis indicated shape variation and accounted for 76\xc2\xa0% of the total variance. In discriminant function analysis of the significantly different morphometric parameters, 96.9\xc2\xa0% of cross-validated grouped cases were correctly classified and the sub-populations were discriminated. Parameters like dorsal fin length, snout length, inter-orbital length, pre-anal length, head length, pre-dorsal length and pre pectoral length were mainly responsible for variations and discrimination between the sub-populations in the discriminant function analysis. The fish from the two environments also deviated from the so called cube law which indicated the different growth rate in length-weight relationship study. Significant divergence in morphometric analysis revealed that intraspecific variations existed between the two sub-populations of C. punctatus. Therefore, these findings indicate the presence of two different stocks of C. punctatus.'

Abstract: 'Random-amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and microsatellite markers were developed and used for the analysis of genetic variability in the critically endangered yellow catfish Horabagrus nigricollaris, sampled from the Chalakkudy River, Kerala, India. Eight RAPD and five microsatellite markers were detected to genotype the species. In RAPD, the 73 fragments were 20.55% polymorphic, whereas 4 polymorphic loci (80%) were obtained in microsatellites. In microsatellites, the number of alleles across the 5 loci was 1\xe2\x80\x935, and the range of heterozygosity was 0.25\xe2\x80\x930.5. The mean observed number of alleles was 2.4, and the effective number was 1.775 per locus. The average heterozygosity across all investigated samples was 0.29, indicating a significant deficiency of heterozygotes in this species. RAPD and microsatellite methods report a low degree of gene diversity and lack of genetic heterogeneity in the population of H. nigricollaris, emphasizing the need for fishery management, conservation, and rehabilitation of this species.'

Abstract: 'The influence of anthropogenic loading on the distribution of soft bottom benthic organisms of a tropical estuary (Cochin backwaters) was examined. The industrial activities were found to be high in the northern and central part of the estuary, where dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN\xc2\xa0> 210\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) and phosphorus (DIP > 6.5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) have caused high abundance of chlorophyll a (up to 73\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x893) and accumulation of organic carbon in sediments (up to 5%). Principal component analysis distinguished three zones in the estuary. The central zone (Z1) was characterized by organic enrichment, low species diversity, and increased number of pollution tolerant species. Long-term deterioration of the estuary is indicated by an increase in the nutrients and chlorophyll a levels by sixfold during the last few decades. Flow restrictions in the lower estuary have lead to a fourfold increase in sediment organic carbon over the period of three decades. The reduced benthic diversity followed by an invasion of opportunistic polychaetes (Capitella capitata), are indicative of a stress in the estuary.'

Abstract: ' Mucuna pruriens var. utilis, an underutilized tropical legume has a nutritional quality comparable to soya beans and other conventional legumes as it contains similar proportions of protein, lipid, minerals, and other nutrients. The beans have been traditionally used as a food in a number of countries, viz., India, Philippines, Nigeria, Ghana, Brazil, and Malawi. Recently, the velvet beans are exploited as a protein source in the diets of fish, poultry, pig, and cattle after subjected to appropriate processing methods. Although the velvet beans contain high levels of protein and carbohydrate, their utilization is limited due to the presence of a number of antinutritional/antiphysiological compounds, phenolics, tannins, L-Dopa, lectins, protease inhibitors, etc., which may reduce the nutrient utilization. Unfortunately, even though many researchers all over the world working on Mucuna, only scanty and conflicting information are available regarding its utilization as a food/feed and no scientific gathering to date has focused on the food/feed applications of Mucuna. Hence, the present review has been emphasized on the nutritional potential of this underutilized, nonconventional legume and current state of its utilization as food/feed for both human beings and livestock throughout the world.'

Abstract: 'The objective reality of uneven water resource distribution and imbalanced water demand of the human society makes it inevitable to transfer water. It has been an age-old method to adopt the inter-basin water transfers (IBTs) for alleviating and even resolving the urgent demand of the water-deficient areas. A number of countries have made attempts and have achieved enormous benefits. However, IBTs inevitably involve the redistribution of water resources in relevant basins and may cause changes of the ecological environment in different basins. Such changes are two-sided, namely, the positive impacts, including adding new basins for water-deficient areas, facilitating water cycle, improving meteorological conditions in the recipient basins, mitigating ecological water shortage, repairing the damaged ecological system, and preserving the endangered wild fauna and flora, as well as the negative impacts, including salinization and aridification of the donor basins, damage to the ecological environment of the donor basins and the both sides of the conveying channel system, increase of water consumption in the recipient basins, and spread of diseases, etc. Because IBTs have enormous ecological risk, it is necessary to comprehensively analyze the inter-basin water balance relationship, coordinate the possible conflicts and environmental quality problems between regions, and strengthen the argumentation of the ecological risk of water transfer and eco-compensation measures. In addition, there are some effective alternative measures for IBTs, such as attaching importance to water cycle, improving water use efficiency, developing sea water desalination, and rainwater harvesting technology, etc.'

Abstract: 'A micropropagation protocol was developed for Celastrus paniculatus, a vulnerable medicinal plant. Cultures were initiated from nodal explants collected from young shoots of a 12-year-old plant in MS basal medium. An average of five shoots were produced in MS medium supplemented with 1.5\xe2\x80\x89mg\xe2\x80\x89l\xe2\x88\x921 benzyl adenine (BA) and 0.1\xe2\x80\x89mg\xe2\x80\x89l\xe2\x88\x921 naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) after two subculture cycles with a 30-day interval. Continuous subculture in the same medium for three more cycles resulted in reduction of the number of multiple shoots (2 or 3 shoots), vitrification of the shoots, and callus formation. Vitrification of cultures could be overcome by the use of MS medium supplemented with lower concentrations of BA (0.05\xe2\x80\x89mg\xe2\x80\x89l\xe2\x88\x921) and NAA (0.01\xe2\x80\x89mg\xe2\x80\x89l\xe2\x88\x921). Among the various rooting trials, ex vitro rooting of shoots with simultaneous hardening was most efficient. The method standardized in the present study is simple, as it eliminated separate steps for in vitro rooting and hardening. Qualitative chemical similarity of the tissue culture regenerants with the mother plant was confirmed using high performance thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) profiling.'

Abstract: 'We studied the spatio-temporal patterns of ground-dwelling and -foraging ant assemblages in a continuous mixed secondary lowland rainforest on the northern periphery of the Dja Biosphere Reserve in southeast Cameroon. The effect of season and of the interaction of season with vegetation type on ant species density, activity and composition were investigated. We also checked for a possible impact of army ant activity on the ant assemblage. Ants were collected by pitfall trapping in seven vegetation types in each of three seasons during 12 months in 2003 and 2004\xe2\x80\x932005. Season significantly influenced the ground-dwelling ant assemblage. The late wet season had the lowest ant species density and a different species composition than the early wet and the dry season. Also inter-annual variation in ant species density and composition was detected and could partly be explained by an influence of Dorylus activity. In general, vegetation type and inter-annual variation had a larger influence on the ground-ant assemblage than season. Significant effects of interactions between season, year, vegetation type and army ants on the ant assemblage confirm that also in African rainforests ant assemblages are extremely dynamic and depend on a complex combination of availability of food resources, nest sites and predators.'

The evergreen forests subjected to shorter rotation of commercial exploitation are being invaded with seral deciduous species. The study highlights the status of forests (spatial and community) and stresses the need to conserve germplasm present in the natural evergreen forests.'

Abstract: 'A total of 42 (21 surface water and 21 bed sediments) samples were collected from upstream to downstream stretches of Meenachil river during pre-monsoon (PRM), monsoon (MON) and post monsoon (POM) seasons. DOC in water showed increasing trend spatially while temporal study illustrates high mean value during PRM (1.58\xc2\xa0ppm) followed by POM (0.97) and MON (0.36). Spatial assessment of elements such as Ca, Mg, K and Na in sediments reveals erratic trend during different seasons, while total phosphorous showed escalating trend signifying abrupt addition from anthropogenic sources. Based on characteristic carbon to nitrogen ratio, the study demonstrates significant control of macrophyte in terrestrial organic matter accumulation along downstream stations.'

Abstract: 'The response of decomposition of litter for the dominant tree species in disturbed (pine), rehabilitated (pine and broadleaf mixed) and mature (monsoon evergreen broadleaf) forests in subtropical China to simulated N deposition was studied to address the following hypothesis: (1) litter decomposition is faster in mature forest (high soil N availability) than in rehabilitated/disturbed forests (low soil N availability); (2) litter decomposition is stimulated by N addition in rehabilitated and disturbed forests due to their low soil N availability; (3) N addition has little effect on litter decomposition in mature forest due to its high soil N availability. The litterbag method (a total of 2880 litterbags) and N treatments: Control-no N addition, Low-N: \xe2\x88\x925\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x88\x921, Medium-N: \xe2\x88\x9210\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x88\x921, and High-N: \xe2\x88\x9215\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 y\xe2\x88\x921, were employed to evaluate decomposition. Results indicated that mature forest, which has likely been N saturated due to both long-term high N deposition in the region and the age of the ecosystem, had the highest litter decomposition rate, and exhibited no significant positive and even some negative response to nitrogen additions. However, both disturbed and rehabilitated forests, which are still N limited due to previous land use history, exhibited slower litter decomposition rates with significant positive effects from nitrogen additions. These results suggest that litter decomposition and its responses to N addition in subtropical forests of China vary depending on the nitrogen status of the ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'Multifaceted issues or paradigm of sustainable development should be appropriately addressed in the discipline of environmental management. Pollution of the biosphere with toxic metals has accelerated dramatically since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. In present review, comparative assessment of traditional chemical technologies and phytoremediation has been reviewed particularly in the context of cost-effectiveness. The potential of phytoremediation and green chemicals in heavy metals management has been described critically. Further, the review explores our work on phytoremediation as green technology during the last 6\xc2\xa0years and hand in hand addresses the various ecological issues, benefits and constraints pertaining to heavy metal pollution of aquatic ecosystems and its phytoremediation as first case study. Second case study demonstrates the possible health implications associated with use of metal contaminated wastewater for irrigation in peri-urban areas of developing world. Our researches revealed wetland plants/macrophytes as ideal bio-system for heavy metals removal in terms of both ecology and economy, when compared with chemical treatments. However, there are several constraints or limitations in the use of aquatic plants for phytoremediation in microcosm as well as mesocosm conditions. On the basis of our past researches, an eco-sustainable model has been proposed in order to resolve the certain constraints imposed in two case studies. In relation to future prospect, phytoremediation technology for enhanced heavy metal accumulation is still in embryonic stage and needs more attention in gene manipulation area. Moreover, harvesting and recycling tools needs more extensive research. A multidisciplinary research effort that integrates the work of natural sciences, environmental engineers and policy makers is essential for greater success of green technologies as a potent tool of heavy metals management.'

Title: 'Quorum sensing inhibitors: can endophytes be prospective sources?'

Abstract: 'Endophytes are microbes which reside inside the plant tissues asymptomatically or causing pathogenicity to the host plant for a brief period. Owing to their presence in a specialized niche, endophytes are capable of synthesizing diverse types of bioactive molecules. Continuous development of resistance mechanism by pathogens to the currently available health treatments and pharmaceuticals has led researchers to explore new therapeutic agents. Quorum sensing has a role in the development of microbial pathogenic traits including biofilm formation. Utilization of quorum sensing (QS) inhibitors in antivirulence approach against pathogenesis is one of the innovative strategies. Endophytic microbes provide a plethora of such required bioactive molecules. This review summarizes the bioprospecting of endophytic microbes for production of novel QS inhibitors. At the outset, an overview is presented about the QS and QS inhibition followed by a summary on the endophytes as a treasure trove of bioactive metabolites, particularly the QS inhibitors. Next, we have outlined screening, purification, production, and application of QS inhibitors starting from the isolation of endophytic microbes. There is huge prospect for endophytes in the domain of human healthcare and food industry, provided that we develop a comprehensive understanding of the biology of endophyte and its ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'An efficient micropropagation protocol based on multiple shoot induction and callus regeneration has been standardized in Sarcostemma brevistigma, a rare medicinal plant. The nodal cuttings were cultured on MS medium supplemented with BA (0.5\xe2\x80\x938\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) or Kn (0.5\xe2\x80\x938\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) alone or in combination with NAA (0.5\xe2\x80\x931.5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM). Maximum multiple shoot induction was observed on MS medium supplemented with 4\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM BA. On this medium, 100% cultures responded with an average number of 11.3 shoots per explant. However, the average shoot length was limited to only 0.9\xc2\xa0cm on this medium. The addition of 1\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM NAA along with 4\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM BA gave rise to an average number of 10.9 shoots with an average shoot length of 1.8\xc2\xa0cm. Luxuriantly growing callus was obtained on MS medium supplemented with BA (5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) and 2,4-D (2\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM). The callus was subcultured on MS medium supplemented with BA (2\xe2\x80\x9315\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) or Kn (2\xe2\x80\x9315\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) alone or in combination with NAA (0.5\xe2\x80\x932\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) for shoot organogenesis. Optimum callus regeneration was obtained on MS medium supplemented with 10\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM BA and 1\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM NAA. On this medium, 100% cultures responded with an average number of 13.4 shoots per culture. The shoots obtained via multiple shoot induction and organogenesis were rooted on half-strength MS medium supplemented with NAA (1\xe2\x80\x937\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) or IBA (1\xe2\x80\x937\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM). IBA was better than NAA in terms of both the percentage of cultures that responded and the average number of roots per explant. The rooted shoots were successfully transplanted to soil with 86% success. This standardized protocol will help to conserve this rare medicinal plant.'

Title: 'RAPD and microsatellite transferability studies in selected species of Prosopis (section Algarobia) with emphasis on Prosopis juliflora and P. pallida '

Abstract: 'The genus Prosopis (Leguminosae, Mimosoideae), comprises 44 species widely distributed in arid and semi-arid zones. Prosopis pallida (Humb. & Bonpl. ex Willd.) Kunth and P. juliflora (Sw.) DC. are the two species that are truly tropical apart from P. africana, which is native to tropical Africa (Pasiecznik et al. 2004), and they have been introduced widely beyond their native ranges. However, taxonomic confusion within the genus has hampered exploitation and better management of the species. The present study focusses primarily on evaluating the genetic relationship between Prosopis species from the section Algarobia, containing most species of economic importance, though P. tamarugo from section Strombocarpa is also included for comparison. In total, 12 Prosopis species and a putative P. pallida \xc3\x97 P. chilensis hybrid were assessed for their genetic relationships based on RAPD markers and microsatellite transferability. The results show that P. pallida and P. juliflora are not closely related despite some morphological similarity. Evidence also agrees with previous studies which suggest that the grouping of series in section Algarobia is artificial.'

Abstract: 'The precautionary principle is one of the most contentious principles in contemporary international legal developments. The very fact that it is a principle of international environmental law has been questioned by many legal scholars. However, this does not take away the fact that the precautionary principle continues to be applied widely across sectors both internationally and nationally. The nature and scope of its application has varied widely according to the context and sector within which it has been applied. The central issue which this article seeks to address is the regulatory and the policy making space that is available to the Government of India in the context of the obligations as undertaken under the Cartagena Protocol and under various other international treaties. The regulatory space would also be affected by the domestic legal developments across sectors in which the principle has been applied. India\xe2\x80\x99s recent decision on the large-scale commercialisation of Bt-Cotton has already created much debate regarding its appropriateness given the realities of Indian farm practices. More specifically, it has also led to a rethinking of the role and application of the precautionary principle in addressing these realities. Considering that the Indian policy on biotechnology is currently being drafted, it is important to look into the scope of applying the precautionary principle in taking any decision on genetically modified organisms (GMO) in terms of their distribution of risks, incorporating the social and equity impacts of such decisions.'

Abstract: 'Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus has a long-standing history of bacterial-plant interrelationship as a symbiotic endophyte capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen. In low nitrogen fertilized sugarcane fields it plays a significant role and its occurrence was realised in most of the sugarcane growing countries. In this mini review, the association of G. diazotrophicus with sugarcane, other crop plants and with various hosts is discussed. The factors affecting survival in the rhizosphere and the putative soil mode of transmission are emphasized. In addition, other N2-fixing Acetobacteraceae members, including Gluconacetobacter azotocaptans, Gluconacetobacter johannae and Swaminathania salitolerans, occurring in coffee, corn and rice plants are also covered. Lastly, the plant-growth-promoting traits identified in this group of bacteria, including N2 fixation, phytohormone synthesis, P and Zn solubilization and biocontrol, are analysed.'

Abstract: 'Small cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum Maton) is extensively cultivated in the Western Ghats of South India either as a monocrop under the forest trees or as an intercrop along with arecanut and coffee plantations. Colletotrichum species responsible for severe outbreaks of anthracnose on small cardamom in South India are reported. Small cardamom anthracnose, popularly known as \xe2\x80\x9cChenthal\xe2\x80\x9d, manifests itself on the foliage as yellowish lesions, which later coalesce to form large blighted areas. In advanced stages, the affected leaves dry up giving a burnt appearance to the plant. Twenty-five isolates of Colletotrichum were isolated from leaves of small cardamom in Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu states of India. The isolates were characterized through morphological studies and multilocus phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, CYLH3, GS and ApMat gene regions) to test whether different species are present and identified: C. karstii (2 isolates), C. gloeosporioides (1), C. siamense (7), C. syzygicola (6), Colletotrichum sp (5), and C. guajavae (4), as the cause of anthracnose on small cardamom for the first time. Pathogenicity of the six species was confirmed. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed study of Colletotrichum species which cause anthracnose diseases on small cardamom.'

Title: 'Reduced risk for positive soil-feedback on seedling regeneration by invasive trees on a very nutrient-poor soil in Seychelles'
Author: 'Christoph\xc2\xa0Kueffer'
Date: 2010-01

Abstract: 'Invasive plants sometimes alter habitat conditions so as to promote further invasion, either by the same or by other non-native species. Such positive feedbacks often occur because the non-native species increases soil fertility, thereby favouring recruitment of non-native seedlings. This has been demonstrated in nitrogen-poor habitats invaded by nitrogen-fixing species, but it is unclear whether similar processes operate in habitats limited by phosphorus and other nutrients. I compared the growth of seedlings of Cinnamomum verum, an abundant invasive tree on phosphorus-poor soils in the Seychelles, in soils taken from beneath different tree species. I expected that soil phosphorus availability would be higher beneath stands of C. verum than beneath stands of either the native Northea hornei or the non-native nitrogen-fixing species, Falcataria moluccana. I therefore predicted that C. verum seedlings would grow faster in soil taken from beneath C. verum trees than in soil taken from beneath either of the other two species. To test this hypothesis, I performed a bioassay experiment with seedlings of C. verum grown in soils from stands of C. verum, F. moluccana and N. hornei. Different nutrient treatments (control, plus phosphorus (P), plus nitrogen (N), plus N and P, and plus complete fertilizer) were applied to investigate how nutrient availabilities modulate the effects of the trees. In the control treatment without added nutrients, there was a weak tendency for seedlings to perform better in the soils from beneath invasive than native trees. However, seedling growth in soils from beneath invasive species was markedly higher following the addition of phosphorus in the case of the F. moluccana soil, and complete fertilizer in the case of the C. verum soil. These results indicate that on very nutrient-poor soils, a low supply of nutrients other than N may reduce the risk of a soil-feedback by invasive trees on seedling regeneration.'

Abstract: 'Dendrocalamus hamiltonii is a commercially important bamboo species of India, experiencing population depletion due to heavy extraction from natural forests. Nuclear simple sequence repeats (nSSRs) were used to study the genetic diversity and population genetic structure of 19 natural stands of D. hamiltonii distributed across the northeast Himalayas. A total of 68 nSSR primer pairs of D. latiflorus and Bambusa arundinacea have been tested in D. hamiltonii for their transferability, out of which 17 primers showing positive and polymorphic amplification were used for genotyping. A total of 130 alleles were generated in 535 individuals of all the populations using selected primer pairs. The marker analysis indicated that D. hamiltonii populations have maintained a low level of genetic diversity (h\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.175, I\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.291) in northeastern region of India. Despite a large proportion of the genetic variation (83.47%) confined within the populations, a moderate level of genetic differentiation (FST\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.165) was observed among the populations. The clustering pattern obtained in UPGMA and STRUCTURE analysis revealed that most of the populations were clustered in accordance with their geographical distribution. Two populations (DH03 and DH13) exhibiting significant genetic admixture were identified and recommended for in situ conservation. In addition, six highly diverse populations were also suggested for conservation in different geographical area under study. The study has revealed useful nSSR markers for D. hamiltonii, which were lacking earlier and the information generated herein is of paramount importance in devising programs for species conservation and genetic improvement.'

Abstract: 'Genus Chlorophytum Ker Gawl secures its position chiefly as commercial plants with a wide range of applications, right from pharmaceutical to ornamental, and with a promising economical return also. Few species of this genus are now enlisted under \xe2\x80\x9cthreatened plant category\xe2\x80\x9d due to rash harvesting from its wild habitat, as it is utilized extensively in various industries. Great challenges are associated with its conventional propagation approach. The accomplishment and rapidity in the propagation of few species of Chlorophytum have constantly been a key concern for farmers and researchers. In this regard, in vitro propagation is an efficient technique to triumph over regeneration-associated problems. Available literature was surveyed rigorously to extract the information on pharmacological utilities and recent advancements in in vitro regeneration of genus Chlorophytum. Since 1990s to till now, a number of efforts were made in different aspects of Chlorophytum under both in vitro and ex vitro conditions. Current review intends to provide a comprehensive overview of important properties and biotechnological aspects, viz. bioactive constituents and inherent properties of such as aphrodisiac potential, anti-diabetic, anti-microbial, anti-tumor and anti-oxidant, and in vitro production of genus Chlorophytum. Conclusively, proposed article is an attempt to provide overall update of various studies conducted with members of Chlorophytum genus that will possibly be helpful in proper, fullest and sustainable utilization of this important group.'

Abstract: 'An analysis of the flowering plant flora of a lowland moist forest in central French Guiana reveals 298 species with adaptations for wind dispersal. This represents 16.2% of the flowering plant flora and 9.8% of the class Magnoliopsida (dicotyledons). The most diverse wind-dispersed families are the Orchidaceae in the Liliopsida (monocotyledons) with 135 species and the Bignoniaceae in the Magnoliopsida with 37 species. The wind-dispersed species of central French Guiana have evolved either small, dust-like seeds, fruits or seeds with various kinds of wings, fruits or seeds with tufts of hairs, or expanded wing- or parachute-like persistent calyces. Most wind-dispersed species, among the liliopsids, are epiphytes and, among the magnoliopsids, trees or lianas. In central French Guiana, collections of these species with mature diaspores have been gathered most often in October and March, the months with peak wind velocities. In contrast, collections from June and July, when wind velocities are at a minimum, are rare.'

Abstract: 'Adaptive managements on susceptible forested regions not only benefit forest recovery, but also help to improve the stability of soil-degraded area and carbon (C) sequestration. The gain of afforestation on C sink has not been addressed clearly especially in tropical and subtropical regions that will be critical in an era of global warming. Based on the Landsat satellite images, in situ forest survey and archives, we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of C density and storage in a typical soil\xe2\x80\x93water conservation area in Changting county in southeastern China, dominated by the pioneer tree Pinus massoniana forest. The results showed that the C density (storage) increased significantly from 20.14\xc2\xa0Mg C ha\xe2\x88\x921 (0.38\xc2\xa0Tg C) in 1981 to 43.57\xc2\xa0Mg C ha\xe2\x88\x921 (1.98\xc2\xa0Tg C) in 2015 (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05) and proved the success of ecological management adopted considering the interactions between local residential livelihoods and the features of local forest ecosystem. In addition, the differences of C density and storage across elevational and slope gradients also narrowed over the past 35\xc2\xa0years. The landscape also gradually shifted from lower C density to higher C density conditions based on the landscape metrics. The ecological-dominated approaches should be put in a high priority for the issue of C sequestration especially in a changing climate.'

Abstract: 'In the present study, in vitro propagation of tribal endemic medicinal plant, Andrographis lineata has been established using mature nodal explants. High frequency of regeneration (91.4%) was achieved on MS medium containing BA (3.0 mg L\xe2\x80\x931) along with IAA (0.2 mg L\xe2\x80\x931). Strikingly, irrespective of the season and collection period, we observed axillary flower induction and fruit formation from the above in vitro cultures supplemented with BA and NAA. Transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase occurred within 2 months of culture, and importantly was influenced by factors such as sucrose and cytokinins. In vitro-regenerated flowers were morphologically identical to in vivo flowers. Furthermore, our scanning electron microscopic studies revealed that pollen external morphology of both in vitro and in vivo flowers were similar. The flowers self-fertilized and produced fruits in vitro. Elongated shoots rooted well on half-strength MS basal medium, and were successfully acclimatized to the garden conditions. Altogether, our established protocol can be utilized in plant breeding for the purpose of ex situ conservation, quick flowering, and fruit set.'

Abstract: "We studied the distributional pattern of bird's nest ferns (Asplenium nidus complex) and the factors that determined litter accumulation and the abundance of litter-associated microarthropods in the ferns in the forest of Yambaru on the northern part of Okinawa Island, southern Japan. We located 53 bird's nest ferns (41 ferns on 27 live trees of 13 species, and 12 on 5 dead trees) in a ca. 4-ha plot, collected litter samples from 37 ferns on 25 live trees, and then extracted a total of 11\xe2\x80\x89205 microarthropods (Acari and Collembola) from all the litter samples. The ferns preferred concave slopes and tended to be distributed on the tree species that had the typical characteristics of high population density and/or large basal area in the forest. The ferns were usually established on large trees [\xe2\x89\xa510\xe2\x80\x89m high or \xe2\x89\xa520\xe2\x80\x89cm diameter at breast height (DBH)], although the number and size of the ferns were not related to the size of the host trees. The amount of litter accumulated in the ferns was correlated neither with the size (height and DBH) of the host tree nor with the height and position of the ferns. The amount of accumulated litter had a significant positive correlation only with fern size; this might have caused the positive correlations between fern size and the abundance of litter-associated microarthropods and the number of species of oribatid mites in the ferns."

Abstract: 'Malvan coast is one of the Marine Protected Area (MPA) of Maharashtra because of its rich coral reef and biodiversity. The study investigated on phytoplankton assemblage and their diversity with respect to physico-chemical parameters covering protected and unprotected area of Malvan coast. Physico-chemical parameters such as salinity, nitrite, nitrate, and ammonia did not display seasonality due to inadequate fresh water influx and allochthonous nutrient input. Positive correlation of phosphate (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.96, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.0001) and silicate (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.91, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.0001) with Total Suspended Solids (TSS) confirmed their autochthonous origin as a result of resuspension of bottom sediments during monsoon. A total of 57 phytoplankton species were identified mostly dominated by Bascillariophyceae (40 species), followed by Dinophyceae (9 species), Chlorophyceae (5 species), Cyanophyceae (2 species), and Dictyochophyceae (1 species) from Malvan coast. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that water temperature and TSS were the most significant parameters influencing the distribution and seasonal shift in phytoplankton species such as Skeletonema costatum and Chaetoceros sp. during pre-monsoon and Psedo-nitzschia sp., Streptotheca thamensis, Eucampia zodiacus, and Lithodesmium undulatum during post-monsoon. Silicate and phosphate had minor influence on phytoplankton distribution. Shannon-Wiener diversity index as a pollution index suggested that the study area was incipiently polluted except at bay stations. Despite of various human interventions the water quality and phytoplankton assemblage of this area has not reached to an alarming situation. The current study provides a valuable baseline data on phytoplankton assemblage from Malvan coast.'

Abstract: 'Thirty-five new microsatellite loci from the sea cucumbers Holothurian scabra (Jaeger, 1833) and Apostichopus japonicas (Selenka, 1867) were screened and characterized using the method of magnetic bead enrichment. Of the twenty-four polymorphic loci tested, eighteen were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium after a modified false discovery rate (B-Y FDR) correction, whereas six showed statistically significant deviations (CHS2 and CHS11: P<0.014 790; FCS1, FCS6, FCS8 and FCS14: P<0.015 377). Furthermore, four species of plesiomorphous and related sea cucumbers (Holothurian scabra, Holothuria leucospilota, Stichopus horrens and Apostichopus japonicas) were tested for mutual cross-amplification using a total of ninety microsatellite loci. Although transferability and universality of all loci were generally low, the results of the cross-species study showed that the markers can be applied to identify individuals to species according to the presence or absence of specific microsatellite alleles. The microsatellite markers reported here will contribute to the study of genetic diversity, assisted breeding, and population conservation in sea cucumbers, as well as allow for the identification of individuals to closely related species.'

Abstract: ' Azadirachta indica A. Juss, Dalbergia sissoo Roxb., and Melia azedarach L. are little studied species in nutrient return capabilities from leaf litter decomposition to maintenance of the soil fertility despite their importance in agroforestry practices of Bangladesh. A leaf litter decomposition experiment was conducted using a litterbag technique to assess the nutrient return efficiency of these species. The decomposition rate of leaf litter was highest for M. azedarach and lowest for D. sissoo. Rainfall and temperature of study sites showed a significant (p<0.05) positive relationship with the rate of leaf litter decomposition. The highest decay constant was observed for M. azedarach (6.67). Nitrogen and Phosphorus concentration in leaf litter showed a decreased trend sharply at the end of the first month, whereas rapid decrease of Potassium concentration was reported within 10 days. Conversely, higher concentration of nutrient was observed at the later stages of decomposition. All three species showed a similar pattern of nutrient release (K > N > P) during the decomposition process of leaf litter. Among the studied species, D. sissoo was best in terms of N and P return and A. indica was best in terms of K return.'

Abstract: 'Marine sediments contain a record of past events and proved to be an interesting indicator matrix for this study. Instrumental neutron activation analysis and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence techniques offer adequate sensitivity for analysis of trace elements. Grain size analysis of sediment samples before and after tsunami showed a shift in textural characteristics of the sediment which is not observed during regular monsoon and seasonal changes. Some general characteristics of sediments revealed sand content ranges between 39 and 65% and silt from 33 to 53%. Clay content was found low averaging 5.4% and varied from 2 to 13% (by weight). The concentration of Cu, Ni, Fe, Pb, Zn, Mn, Rb, Sr, Ti, K, and Ca varies from 12 to 53, 19\xe2\x80\x9346, 21,952\xe2\x80\x9336,785, 21\xe2\x80\x9339, 39\xe2\x80\x9367, 335\xe2\x80\x93856, 47\xe2\x80\x9361, 223\xe2\x80\x93400, 4,991\xe2\x80\x938,054, 11,000\xe2\x80\x9315,791, and 5,878\xe2\x80\x9311,214\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. The positive correlation was observed for Cu, Ni, Ti, K, and Rb with respect to Fe. The negative correlation was observed for Ca, Sr, Zn, and Pb with respect to Fe, indicating the different source for these metals in the marine sediment. Decrease of the particle-reactive element in the tsunami impacted sediment indicates removal of clay component in the sediment, which is supported by the presence of low Th/U ratio.'

Abstract: 'Soil fungi are key mediators of negative density-dependent mortality in seeds and seedlings, and the ability to withstand pathogens in the shaded understory of closed-canopy forests could reinforce light gradient partitioning by tree species. For four species of tropical rainforest trees\xe2\x80\x94two shade-tolerant and two shade-intolerant\xe2\x80\x94we conducted a field experiment to examine the interactive effects of fungal pathogens, light, and seed density on germination and early seedling establishment. In a fully factorial design, seeds were sown into 1\xc2\xa0m2 plots containing soil collected from underneath conspecific adult trees, with plots assigned to forest edge (high light) or shaded understory, high or low density, and fungicide or no fungicide application. We monitored total seed germination and final seedling survival over 15\xc2\xa0weeks. Shade-intolerant species were strongly constrained by light; their seedlings survived only at the edge. Fungicide application significantly improved seedling emergence and/or survival for three of the four focal species. There were no significant interactions between fungicide and seed density, suggesting that pathogen spread with increased aggregation of seeds and seedlings did not contribute to pathogen-mediated mortality. Two species experienced significant edge-fungicide interactions, but fungicide effects in edge vs. interior forest varied with species and recruitment stage. Our results suggest that changes to plant-pathogen interactions could affect plant recruitment in human-impacted forests subject to fragmentation and edge-effects.'

Abstract: 'All orchids maintain an obligate relationship with mycorrhizal symbionts during seed germination. In most cases, germination-enhancing fungi have been isolated from roots of mature plants for conservation and cultivation purposes. To understand the germination biology of Dendrobium devonianum, an over-collected medicinal orchid, the seeds of D. devonianum were inoculated with a fungal strain (FDd1) isolated from naturally occurring protocorms of D. devonianum and two other germination-enhancing fungal strains (FDaI7 and FCb4) from D. aphyllum and Cymbidium mannii, respectively. The fungal strain was isolated from five protocorms of D. devonianum and identified as a species of the genus Epulorhiza. In germination trials, treatments with all of the three fungal strains showed a significant promoting effect on seed germination and protocorm formation, compared with the control treatment (no inoculation). However, FDd1 fungal strain showed the greatest effectiveness followed by FDaI7 and FCb4. For all inoculation and control treatments, seeds developed to protocorms regardless of the presence of illumination, whereas protocorms did not develop to seedlings unless illumination was provided. The results of our manipulative experiments confirmed the hypothesis that mycorrhizae associated with orchid seedlings are highly host-specific, and the degree of specificity may be life stagespecific under in vitro conditions. The specific mycorrhizal symbionts from protocorms can enhance restoration efforts and the conservation of orchids such as D. devonianum.'

Abstract: ' Zingiber zerumbet (L) Smith, a wild clonal species related to the cultivated ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe), is a potential resistance donor for soft rot disease in ginger caused by Pythium aphanidermatum (Edson) Fitzp. In this study we evaluated the genetic diversity and P. aphanidermatum resistance of 74 Z. zerumbet accessions belonging to 15 populations from eight districts in Kerala state, India. The disease index (DI) of the accessions varied from 0% to 72.24% and the accessions could be separated into six frequency classes according to their DI values. More than 65% of the accessions had a DI\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa020%. Eight accessions were found to be immune to the infection. The relative frequency of resistant accessions was higher in the central and northern regions of Kerala. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis of Z. zerumbet accessions using five primer combinations yielded 215 bands in total, of which 175 (81.4%) were polymorphic. Nei\xe2\x80\x99s genetic diversity (h) of 0.2738 and Shannon information index (I) of 0.4012 revealed a high genetic diversity in Z. zerumbet unexpected for a clonal species. In the UPGMA dendrogram, accessions were clustered mostly according to their geographical origin and no clear correspondence was observed between the clustering pattern of accessions and their responses to Pythium aphanidermatum. The study revealed high genetic diversity and variability for pathogen resistance among Z. zerumbet accessions and confirmed the value of Z. zerumbet as a potential donor for soft rot resistance for the genetic improvement of ginger.'

Abstract: 'Study on variability in area, production, and productivity of coffee in India during last decade indicates that area and production of coffee is increasing whereas yield of coffee is decreasing trend during the period 1990\xe2\x80\x931991 to 2015\xe2\x80\x932016. There was increasing trend of Robusta coffee and decreasing trend of Arabica coffee yields in India with three distinct periods due to climate change. Micro-level study was conducted on variability in yield of Arabica and Robusta coffee vis-\xc3\xa0-vis climate change, variability of parameters like rainfall (RF), maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), and mean relative humidity (RH) was undertaken with data recorded at Regional Coffee Research Station, Chundale, Wayanad, Kerala State. The yield data for 35\xc2\xa0years (1980 to 2014) revealed that the yield of Robusta coffee was higher than that of Arabica coffee in most of the years due to favorable climate requirements in Kerala. There was increasing trend of yield of Robusta coffee in Kerala and decreasing trend of Arabica coffee. Blossom showers had significance influence in increasing the yield of coffee rather than total annual rainfall in Robusta coffee. El Ni\xc3\xb1o events have little effect on coffee production in India in general, and out of 11 El Ni\xc3\xb1o years, only 3\xc2\xa0years coffee productivity was adversely affected. However, with respect to Kerala, Arabica yield was adversely affected in strong El Ni\xc3\xb1o years, which was again confirmed with NDVI anomaly too.'

Abstract: 'The group size, age and sex ratio of gaur was studied in the Tropical Deciduous habitat of Kuldiha Wildlife Sanctuary, Odisha, eastern India, during 2012\xe2\x80\x932013. Gaurs were observed by regular monitoring along the motorable roads and forest trails covering a total 3864\xc2\xa0km. The overall mean group size and crowding were 6.92\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.02 (SE) and 6.9 respectively which varied significantly between seasons. The sex ratio was skewed to females and there was an increase in adult male ratio during winter season. Calves were observed throughout the year with a slightly peak during December and January. Compared to the gaur population from other regions of India, the group size range in Kuldiha Wildlife Sanctuary is the smaller one, thus indicating a low population density. Therefore, appropriate management intervention is required for long term conservation of the species.'

Abstract: 'A morpho-taxonomic study of leaf remains from the upper part of the Siwalik succession of sediments (Kimin Formation; upper Pliocene to lower Pleistocene) of Papumpare district, Arunachal Pradesh, India, revealed 23 species representing 20 genera belonging to 15 angiosperm families. The recovered fossil leaves are comparable to modern Bambusa tulda Roxb. (Poaceae), Mangifera indica Linn., Dracontomelum mangiferum Blume (Anacardiaceae); Chonemorpha macrophylla G.

(Rhamnaceae). Among these taxa, 11 species are recorded as new to the Neogene flora of India. Analysis of the floral assemblage with respect to the distribution pattern of modern equivalent taxa and the physiognomic characters of the fossil leaves, suggests that a tropical evergreen forest was growing in a warm humid climate in the region at the time of deposition. This is in contrast to modern tropical semi-evergreen forests that occupy the area. Values of mean annual temperature (MAT) of 29.3\xc2\xb0C and mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 290\xc2\xa0mm have been calculated using leaf-margin characters and fossil leaf size.'

Abstract: 'This paper tries to understand the soil erosion characteristics in a tropical plateau fringe region by the use of Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Soil loss estimation is an important phenomenon to understand the land degradation. An integrated method needs to be adopted in tropical plateau fringe region to estimate the soil loss. RUSLE has been adopted for the present study. The river in the basin under consideration sees its origin from a plateau top region and flows through the plateau fringe region of eastern Chotanagpur plateau, India. The present study area reflects undulated plateau fringe landform with gently sloping dissected plateau topography. The different factors like, rainfall erosivity factor (R), soil erodibility factor (K), topographic factor (LS), crop and management factor (C), and support and practice factor (P) have been enumerated using field and remote sensing data. Each factors result has also been verified with previous literature. All factors have been multiplied in GIS environment to estimate soil loss. High-magnitude soil loss region (>\xe2\x80\x8910\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921) covers 4.88% of the total area and extends up to the upper reaches of the watershed. Topographic and soil factors best represent this loss. Low-magnitude soil loss region (<\xe2\x80\x892.5\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921) in the lower reaches of the watershed is a result of successful land management activity. Soil erosion is dominated process of land degradation in the upper reaches of the watershed and estimation of soil loss is an important input for land-use land-cover management. The study also inferred that RUSLE soil erosion model could be effectively used in tropical plateau fringe environment.'

Abstract: 'Nepal is considered a leader among developing nations with regard to conservation legislation and programs; it was among the first Asian nations to develop national conservation legislation, sign CITES, and develop a national conservation strategy. We review the history of modern conservation law in Nepal from the Rana period (early 1950s) to the present. The early legislation focused mainly on strict preservation of areas and species; this phase culminated in the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1973. Subsequent legislation has evolved more in the direction of an integrated, holistic approach to conservation and is beginning to incorporate the participation of local people; subsequent amendments to the 1973 act allowed greater rights to rural villagers, and the designation of conservation areas in addition to the more strictly defined protected areas (national parks, wildlife reserves, etc.).'

Abstract: 'Small freshwater fish species (SFFs) (length <25\xc2\xa0cm) are highly rich in vitamin A, calcium, iron etc. and hence, can contribute to social health through nutrient supplement to rural communities. Under the pressure of extensive modern agricultural practices and indiscriminate harvesting, stocks of SFFs are gradually declining and their habitats and breeding grounds are also being deteriorated at faster rate. A better conservationist approach could be carp-SFFs integration which will reduce indiscriminate mass capture fishing of SFFs and will ensure conservation of natural SFFs stocks in their habitats providing economic benefit to stakeholders. Different studies have already showed success story of SFF polyculture through carp\xe2\x80\x94SFFs integration. This production cum conservation practice leads to sustainability\xe2\x80\x94a better term in fishery is \xe2\x80\x98social fishery\xe2\x80\x99. However, the part which needs attention is the feeding ecology of SFFs to understand within and between species (with carps) food partitioning and habitat preference as better culture cum conservational approach.'

Abstract: 'A comprehensive morphotaxonomical evaluation of diverse angiospermic dicotyledonous leaf impressions recovered from the middle part of the Siwalik succession (Subansiri Formation: Pliocene) of Arunachal Pradesh, eastern Himalaya, India, shows that the leaf remains are comparable to modern Glochidion J. R. Forst. and G. Forst. (Phyllanthaceae), Bauhinia L., Callerya Endl. (Fabaceae), Mitragyna Korth. (Rubiaceae), Beilschmiedia Nees (Lauraceae), Uvaria L. (Annonaceae), Neolamarckia Bosser (Rubiaceae), Sorindeia Thouars (Anacardiaceae), Lagerstroemia L. (Lythraceae), and Premna L. (Lamiaceae). Among these taxa, seven species are new to the Neogene floras of the Indian subcontinent. Analyses of the floral assemblage, with respect to the present-day distribution pattern of modern equivalent taxa and the physiognomic characters of the recovered fossil leaves, suggest that a tropical evergreen forest was growing in a warm humid climate in the region at the time of deposition. This qualitative climatic data is also corroborated by our previously published quantitative data obtained from a CLAMP (climate leaf analysis multivariate program) analysis on the middle Siwalik floral assemblage. The presence of some Southeast Asian elements in the fossil assemblage provides clear evidence of free exchange of taxa across southern Asia in the Pliocene.'

Abstract: 'Molecular data are increasingly being used to resolve cryptic species complexes; however, subsequent formal species description and taxonomic revisions often remain incomplete. Given that most species are described based on morphology-based alpha taxonomy, one cannot resolve nomenclatural issues of species complexes without the aid of morphology. In this study, we examined the taxonomic status of a long-known human commensal and species complex, Hemidactylus brookii. To this end, samples of H. cf. brookii and related species were collected across India. We analyzed molecular as well as morphological data to resolve the taxonomy of this species complex. Seven deeply divergent, well-supported clades were recovered using the mitochondrial phylogeny, five of which were also retrieved in the nuclear tree. One of these consists of five morphologically distinct species of ground-dwelling Hemidactylus. The genetic distances across each clade of putative species of H. brookii sensu lato were comparable to that between morphologically distinct species of ground-dwelling Hemidactylus. Meristic characters such as number of precloacal-femoral pores, number of non-pore bearing scales interrupting the series of pored scales, dorsal pholidosis, and presence/absence of divided lamellae can be used to distinguish these putative species from each other. However, morphological characters of H. brookii sensu stricto did not correspond to any of the putative species studied. The study also revealed that the \xe2\x80\x9cH. brookii complex\xe2\x80\x9d in India includes two commensal species, Hemidactylus parvimaculatus and Hemidactylus murrayi. Furthermore, these two lineages have independently acquired adaptations that could have assisted them in exploiting human habitat. An identification key to diagnose species within this complex and rest of the Hemidactylus in India is proposed.'

Abstract: 'An understanding of species ecology is vital for effective conservation, particularly if the species forms an important constituent of the lesser mammal guild and regulates small mammal and bird populations. As the ecological role of the leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) in the intricate eastern Himalayan habitats is not known, we assessed the site occupancy, detection probability and activity pattern of leopard cats in Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve, India, based on sign surveys and camera trapping. The estimated site occupancy was 0.352\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.061 and detection probability was 0.143\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.0484. Occupancy modelling indicated low elevation, high rodent abundance and tree cover as best predictors for the occupancy of leopard cat. Diet based on analysed scats revealed murids as the most dominant prey (89.2\xc2\xa0%). Information based on photographic captures indicated that the leopard cat exhibited a nocturnal activity pattern (peak activity between 0200\xe2\x80\x930300\xc2\xa0hours), which coincided with its principal prey (revealed through diet analysis), but mainly contradicted with other sympatric competitors, hence indicating a temporal partitioning of resources among them. Ecological niche factor analysis indicated that the leopard cat exhibits high global marginality (1.32) and low global tolerance (0.275). The habitat suitability map for leopard cats showed majority of the habitat as unsuitable (1,959.44\xc2\xa0km2) and predicted only 164.54\xc2\xa0km2 areas of lower temperate forests as moderate to highly suitable. As highly suitable habitats of the leopard cat are in close proximity to villages, conflict issues are a major threat and therefore need to be addressed in conservation program for this felid.'

Abstract: 'Wild edibles continue to be a significant contributor to the global food basket in much of the developing world. A consensus has now been formed that information on wild edibles is an important part of ethnobotanical knowledge and hence elucidating region-specific patterns of habitat management and consumption assists policy making with regard to natural conservation, human nutrition, and human health. Using an original data set from Gujarat, India, the present research aims to document the collective knowledge of wild edibles possessed by the local Vasava tribe, as well as the habitat usage and consumption trends of these species.'

Title: 'Enhancing spider families and spider webs in Indian rice fields for conservation biological control, considering local and landscape management'

Abstract: 'Spiders are omnipresent, occurring in almost all terrestrial habitats. They are generalist predators and important for conservation biocontrol in agricultural fields, helping to reduce pesticide applications. In this study, we examined how spider families and spider web types in rice fields are related to local and landscape management. Samples were taken in differently managed rice fields adjoining either homegarden polycultures or banana monocultures. Furthermore, landscape structure, prey abundance, herb richness and cover were taken into account. The results showed that prey availability explained most of the variation in spiders and their web\xe2\x80\x99s abundance, indicating that spiders in the rice fields can potentially contribute to pest control. Adjacent habitat had no effect on the spider populations, but maintaining fallow fields in the surrounding landscape seems to be a useful measure to promote Erigoninae in rice fields. There was no evidence that local management practices such as fertiliser and pesticide use had an impact on spider families, which appeared to be due to the low level of these inputs. Spider web sampling can complement spider sampling as it detects spiders hidden at the base of the rice tillers, which are likely to be missed by sweep netting. Additionally, tetragnathid webs are easy to observe and thus can be used as an indication for farmers not to spray pesticides as spiders are potentially controlling the pest species. Interviews with farmers made clear that many farmers in the study area showed their interest in management methods that promote biological pest control.'

Abstract: 'At an elephant camp in central Myanmar (Burma), we interviewed mahouts and veterinarians to describe the diet of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in a mixed-deciduous forest. Elephants showed a broad dietary breadth (103 plant species from 42 families); consumed mostly browse (94% of plant species); and were very selective about plant parts [e.g., many trees were eaten exclusively for their bark (22%) or fruits (14%)]. The fruits from 29 plant species were recorded to be eaten by elephants. Several of these were found as fruit remains, seeds, or seedlings in elephant dung, suggesting a role of Asian elephants in seed dispersal. Work elephants and their mahouts prove to be a rich source of information to understand wild elephant ecology.'

Abstract: 'Insect visitors documented on cashew flowers during the present investigation include 40 species belonging to 13 families of three insect orders. The Hymenopterans were the major floral visitors comprising of bees, ants and wasps followed by dipterans. Among the 40 species recorded as flower visitors, only 13 are considered as pollinators of cashew, in which eight belong to Apidae and five belong to Halictidae. Among the two bee families, Apidae was the most abundant contributing 75.6% of the bee abundance. Within Apidae, the highest species abundance was recorded for Braunsapis picitarsus (20%) followed by Apis cerana indica (16.7%). Halictidae bees contributed to 24.4% of bee abundance, among which Pseudapis oxybeloides was most abundant (17.6%). Peak bee activity was recorded between 11.00 and 13.00\xc2\xa0h for most of the bees. During 10.00\xe2\x80\x9313.00\xc2\xa0h, B. picitarsus was the most abundant (22\xe2\x80\x9331%) followed by P. oxybeloides (18\xe2\x80\x9325%), A. c. indica (12\xe2\x80\x9315%), Ceratina sp. (8\xe2\x80\x9313%) and A. florea (6\xe2\x80\x9314%). Foraging rate was more for A. c. indica followed by B. picitarsus and A. florea. Lesser time was spent by A. c. indica for nectar and P. oxybeloides for pollen (i.e. 1\xe2\x80\x934\xc2\xa0s), while longer time of 3\xe2\x80\x9321, 8\xe2\x80\x9316 and 5\xe2\x80\x9311\xc2\xa0s was spent by A. florea, B. picitarsus and Tetragonula sp., respectively. Bees of C. hieroglyphica, Lasioglossum sp. and Seledonia sp. spent 2\xe2\x80\x936\xc2\xa0s per flower. Foraging rate was higher in A. c. indica and B. picitarsus, while foraging speed was lesser in A. c. indica and P. oxybeloides. Nesting sites of different bee species and the common bee flora in the study area were also recorded.'

Abstract: 'Chintamani Abhayaranya in South 24-Parganas, West Bengal has an exposure to anthropogenic stress for its location. Soil mites here, constituted more than 73% of the population of soil microarthropods. Oribatid mites were found to be the most numerically abundant group among the soil mites, followed by order Mesostigmata. Population maxima and minima of the mite community were recorded during September and May respectively. Soil moisture and organic carbon content of the soil showed strong positive correlation with the abundance of mite population. One-way ANOVA revealed significant difference between the seasonal abundances of mite population. Group diversity of mite population was highest during July and lowest during January. No significant correlation, as per rank correlation analysis was noticed between the group diversity and edaphic factors. Regression analysis showed that only a small fraction variabilty of group diversity could be explained separately by four edaphic factors considered.'

Abstract: 'Numerous specimens of the parasitic nematode Rhabdochona papuanensis Moravec, \xc5\x98\xc3\xadha et Kuchta, 2008 (Spirurida: Rhabdochonidae) were collected from the intestines of the Australian endemic freshwater fish (eastern rainbow fish) Melanotaenia splendida (Peters) (Melanotaeniidae, Atheriniformes) in the Behana Creek, North Queesland during November of 2015. Although many species of Rhabdochona Railliet, 1916 are known to be common parasites of fishes in other continents, the present finding of R. papuanensis represents the first record of the species belonging to this genus from the Australian mainland. Light and scanning electron microscopical examinations of these newly collected specimens made it possible to redescribe in detail this nematode species, originally incompletely described from a congeneric host in Papua New Guinea. Fully developed, filamented eggs of R. papuanensis and the conspecific fourth-stage larva are described for the first time. The present finding of R. papuanensis in M. splendida from Australia represents new host and geographical records.'

Abstract: 'Pesticides residues were quantified in 109 frogs comprising two species (Fejervarya limnocharis and Hoplobatrachus crassus) from organic and conventional paddy farms in Kerala, India. Seven frogs from conventional but none from the organic farms revealed deformities. Levels of total Organochlorines (OCs) (33.22\xc2\xa0ng/g) and Synthetic Pyrethroid, Fenvalerate-II (26.91/42.15\xc2\xa0ng/g) in deformed F. limnocharis and H. crassus were significantly greater than in healthy frogs. Among OCs in healthy frogs, traces of \xce\xb3 (gamma)-HCH (hexachlorocyclohexane) (2.12\xc2\xa0ng/g) were found only in F. limnocharis from organic farm. Among Organophosphates, Phorate (1.02\xc2\xa0ng/g) and Quinalphos (2.62\xc2\xa0ng/g) were present in traces in deformed F. limnocharis, while Parathion ethyl (1.02\xc2\xa0ng/g) was detected in deformed H. crassus. The data indicate that the high level of pesticides may have contributed to the deformity of frogs. Therefore, an elaborative study will be essential to conserve amphibians in India.'

Abstract: 'The present study is undertaken to analyse the genetic diversity of Roscoea procera Wall. (an endemic Himalayan medicinal herb) collected from 11 different populations of West Himalaya using ISSR markers. Of the total 130 ISSR primers screened, only ten ISSR primers generated 94 clear and reproducible banding patterns, of which 89 bands (94.68\xc2\xa0%) were polymorphic. Based on the percentage of polymorphic loci (94.68\xc2\xa0%), Nei\xe2\x80\x99s gene diversity (0.198) and Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s information index (0.329), high genetic diversity was detected at the species level. Genetic differentiation (G ST\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.202) was also recorded as moderate level due to high gene flow (Nm\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01.976) among populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that most of the genetic variation (90\xc2\xa0%) resided within the populations (\xce\xa6 ST\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.10). STRUCTURE analysis revealed two ancestral groups of the species, which were further supported by neighbour-joining cluster analysis. Among the different ecological habitats, high genetic diversity in populations under open grassy land showed suitability and preferred habitat conditions. High genetic diversity within population suggests in situ and ex situ conservation of selected populations for conserving and maintaining wide genetic pool of the species.'

Abstract: 'Many seeds carry endophytes, which ensure good chances of seedling colonization. In this work, we have studied the seed-borne bacterial flora of rice varieties cultivated in the northeast of Argentina. Surface-sterilized husked seeds of the rice cultivars CT6919, El Paso 144, CAMBA, and IRGA 417 contained an average of 5\xc3\x97106 CFU/g of mesophilic and copiotrophic bacteria. Microbiological, physiological, and molecular characterization of a set of 39 fast-growing isolates from the CT6919 seeds revealed an important diversity of seed-borne mesophiles and potential plant probiotic activities, including diazotrophy and antagonism of fungal pathogens. In fact, the seed-borne bacterial flora protected the rice seedlings against Curvularia sp. infection. The root colonization pattern of 2 Pantoea isolates from the seeds was studied by fluorescence microscopy of the inoculated axenic rice seedlings. Both isolates strongly colonized the site of emergence of the lateral roots and lenticels, which may represent the entry sites for endophytic spreading. These findings suggest that rice plants allow grain colonization by bacterial species that may act as natural biofertilizers and bioprotectives early from seed germination.'

Abstract: 'Thirty-six lactic acid bacteria belong to Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and Pediococcus were isolated, and the spectrum of antifungal activity was verified against Fusarium oxysporum (KACC 42109), Aspergillus niger (KACC 42589), Fusarium moniliforme (KACC 08141), Penicillium chrysogenum (NII 08137), and the yeast Candida albicans (MTCC 3017). Three isolates, identified as Pediococcus pentosaceus (TG2), Lactobacillus casei (DY2), and Lactococcus (BSN) were selected further, and their antifungal compounds were identified by ESI-MS and HPLC analysis as a range of carboxylic acids along with some unidentified, higher molecular weight compounds. An attempt to check out the shelf life extension of wheat bread without fungal spoilage was performed by fermenting the dough with the Lactococcus isolate. Apart from growth in low pH and tolerance to bile salts, probiotic potential of these three isolates was further substantiated by in vitro screening methods that include transit tolerance to the conditions in the upper human gastrointestinal tract and bacterial adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines.'

Abstract: 'Rivers in the southwest coast of India are under immense pressure due to various kinds of human activities among which indiscriminate extraction of construction grade sand is the most disastrous one. The situation is rather alarming in the rivers draining the Vembanad lake catchments as the area hosts one of the fast developing urban-cum-industrial centre, the Kochi city, otherwise called the Queen of Arabian Sea. The Vembanad lake catchments are drained by seven rivers whose length varies between 78 and 244\xc2\xa0km and catchment area between 847 and 5,398\xc2\xa0km2. On an average, 11.73\xc2\xa0million\xc2\xa0ty\xe2\x88\x921 of sand and gravel are being extracted from the active channels and 0.414\xc2\xa0million\xc2\xa0ty\xe2\x88\x921 of sand from the river floodplains. The quantity of instream mining is about 40 times the higher than the sand input estimated in the gauging stations. As a result of indiscriminate sand mining, the riverbed in the storage zone is getting lowered at a rate of 7\xe2\x80\x9315\xc2\xa0cm\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x88\x921 over the past two decades. This, in turn, imposes severe damages to the physical and biological environments of these river systems. The present paper deals with the environmental effects of indiscriminate sand mining from the small catchment rivers in the southwest coast of India, taking the case of the rivers draining the Vembanad lake catchments as an example.'

Abstract: 'A study was carried out on seed characteristics of nine different tree species of six botanical families for germination and viability during three years, 2008\xe2\x80\x932009, 2009\xe2\x80\x932010 and 2010\xe2\x80\x932011. Average germination percentages after 5, 10 and 20\xc2\xa0days were 27.22, 55.56 and 69.44\xc2\xa0% for all nine species. Highest germination percentage was recorded in two species of bombacaceae, viz., Bombax ceiba (95\xc2\xa0%), followed by Ceiba pentandra L (30\xc2\xa0%). Rest of the species showed less than 30\xc2\xa0% germination after 5\xc2\xa0days of incubation. After 20\xc2\xa0days, seedling length was highest in B. ceiba, followed by Leucaena leucocphala with values of 16.20 and 16.05\xc2\xa0cm, respectively. Average seedling vigor index (SVI) was 59.08 after 5\xc2\xa0days, which increased regularly with values of 479.38 and 865.11 after 10 and 20\xc2\xa0days. Highest SVI was recorded in B. ceiba, following by Sterculia urens at all the stages after 5, 10 and 20\xc2\xa0days. Average viability was 91.22\xc2\xa0% among all species, with highest value of 94\xc2\xa0% for Albizia lebbeck. Two species, viz., C. pentandra and Delonix regia exhibited lowest viability of 80\xc2\xa0%. Root length/shoot length (RL/SL) ratio decreased with age from 9.86 at 5\xc2\xa0days after germination to 0.75 and 0.52 at 10 and 20\xc2\xa0days after germination, respectively. In general seeds were recalcitrant type. Knowledge on germination, pattern and viability is not only important for understanding community process but also for framing strategies for conservation of biodiversity and restoration of forests.'

Abstract: 'The present study includes a systematic analysis of sediment contamination by heavy metals of the River Ghaghara flowing through the Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in Indian Territory. To estimate the geochemical environment of the river, seven heavy metals, namely Co, Cu, Cr, Ni, Cd, Zn, and Pb were examined from the freshly deposited river bed sediment. All the sediment samples were collected on a seasonal basis for the assessment of fluctuation in 2014\xe2\x80\x932015 and after preparation samples were analyzed using standard procedure. Result showed that heavy metal concentration ranged between 11.37 and 18.42\xc2\xa0mg/kg for Co, 2.76 and 11.74\xc2\xa0mg/kg for Cu, 61.25 and 87.68\xc2\xa0mg/kg for Cr, 15.29 and 25.59\xc2\xa0mg/kg for Ni, 0.21 and 0.28\xc2\xa0mg/kg for Cd, 13.26 and 17.59\xc2\xa0mg/kg for Zn, 10.71 and 14.26\xc2\xa0mg/kg for Pb in different season. Metal contamination factor indicates the anthropogenic input in the river sediment was in the range of (0.62\xe2\x80\x930.97) for Co, (0.04\xe2\x80\x930.26) for Cu, (0.68\xe2\x80\x930.97) for Cr, (0.22\xe2\x80\x930.38) for Ni, (0.70\xe2\x80\x930.93) for Cd, (0.14\xe2\x80\x930.19) for Zn, and (0.54\xe2\x80\x930.71) for Pb. The highest contamination degree of the sediment was noticed as 4.01 at Ayodhya and lowest as 3.16 at Katerniaghat. Geo-accumulation index was noted between (0 and 1) which showed that sediment was uncontaminated to moderately contaminated and may have adverse affects on freshwater ecology of the river. Pollution load index (PLI) was found highest at Chhapra which was 0.45 and lowest at Katerniaghat  which was 0.35 and it indicates that the river sediment has a low level of contamination. Significant high correlation was observed between Co, Cu, and Zn, it suggests same source of contamination input is mainly due to human settlement and agriculture activity. Positive correlation between Zn, Co, Cu, Cr, and Ni indicated a natural origin of these elements in the river sediment. Cluster analysis suggests grouping of similar polluted sites. The strong similarity between Co, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cu, and Cd showed relationship of these metals come from the same origin, which is possibly from natural and anthropogenic input which was also confirmed by correlation analysis. Using the various pollution indicators it was found that the river bed sediment is less contaminated by toxic metals during the study but the sediment quality may degrade in the near future  due to increasing anthropogenic inputs in the river basin, hence proper management strategies are required to control the direct dumping of wastewater in the river.'

Abstract: 'Fourteen geographical isolates of entomopathogenic fungus, Nomuraea rileyi (Farlow) Samson were tested for their germination potential. They were also screened for concentration and time mortality response against tobacco caterpillar, Spodoptera litura. Four samples were found superior in germination. The maximum spore germination was observed in isolate Nr-Kc collected from cadaver of S. litura (84.16\xc2\xa0%) followed by isolate Nr-Mc (82.60\xc2\xa0%), Nr-Rc (82.48\xc2\xa0%) and Nr-Hc (82.06\xc2\xa0%). Lowest LC50 value was recorded by the isolate Nr-Kc against second and third instar larvae of S. litura (1.26\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0105 and 1.60\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0106, respectively). Similarly, the isolate Nr-Kc also recorded lowest LT50 value in respect of second instar (143.89\xc2\xa0h) and third instar (178.43\xc2\xa0h) larvae of S. litura. '

Title: 'Framework for mapping the drivers of coastal vulnerability and spatial decision making for climate-change adaptation: A case study from Maharashtra, India'

Abstract: 'The impacts of climate change are of particular concern to the coastal region of tropical countries like India, which are exposed to cyclones, floods, tsunami, seawater intrusion, etc. Climate-change adaptation presupposes comprehensive assessment of vulnerability status. Studies so far relied either on remote sensing-based spatial mapping of physical vulnerability or on certain socio-economic aspects with limited scope for upscaling or replication. The current study is an attempt to develop a holistic and robust framework to assess the vulnerability of coastal India at different levels. We propose and estimate cumulative vulnerability index (CVI) as a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, at the village level, using nationally comparable and credible datasets. The exposure index (EI) was determined at the village level by decomposing the spatial multi-hazard maps, while sensitivity (SI) and adaptive capacity indices (ACI) were estimated using 23 indicators, covering social and economic aspects. The indicators were identified through the literature review, expert consultations, opinion survey, and were further validated through statistical tests. The socio-economic vulnerability index (SEVI) was constructed as a function of sensitivity and adaptive capacity for planning grassroot-level interventions and adaptation strategies. The framework was piloted in Sindhudurg, a coastal district in Maharashtra, India. It comprises 317 villages, spread across three taluks viz., Devgad, Malvan and Vengurla. The villages in Sindhudurg were ranked based on this multi-criteria approach. Based on CVI values, 92 villages (30%) in Sindhudurg were identified as highly vulnerable. We propose a decision tool for identifying villages vulnerable to changing climate, based on their level of sensitivity and adaptive capacity in a two-dimensional matrix, thus aiding in planning location-specific interventions. Here, vulnerability indicators are classified and designated as \xe2\x80\x98drivers\xe2\x80\x99 (indicators with significantly high values and intervention priority) and \xe2\x80\x98buffers\xe2\x80\x99 (indicators with low-to-moderate values) at the village level. The framework provides for aggregation or decomposition of CVI and other sub-indices, in order to plan spatial contingency plans and enable swift action for climate adaptation.'

Abstract: 'Water samples were collected from three selected mangrove ecosystems of Kali Estuary west coast Karwar, on monthly basis and analyzed for various hydrographic parameters. The present work would give the recent information on the hydrographic condition of the mangrove ecosystem of Kali estuary. Surface water temperature varied from 27.4 to 32.07\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C and the salinity ranged between 4.1 and 30.15\xc2\xa0ppt, pH ranged between 7.00 and 8.89. Variation in dissolved oxygen content was from 2.46 to 6.47\xc2\xa0ml/l and suspended matter ranged between 0.03 and 1.05\xc2\xa0gm/l. Concentrations of nutrients viz. phosphates (0.71\xe2\x80\x932.38\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0at/l), nitrates (0.73\xe2\x80\x932.42\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0at/l), nitrites (0.07\xe2\x80\x930.98\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0at/l) and silicate (131.18\xe2\x80\x93298.18\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0at/l) also varied independently. The results of the study revealed that hydrographical conditions fluctuated moderately throughout the year.'

Title: 'Genetic diversity and relationships in Corchorus olitorius (Malvaceae s.l.) inferred from molecular and morphological data'

Abstract: 'In this study, we investigated the genetic diversity and relationships in C. olitorius by analysing populations representing different distribution areas, and developed a hypothesis on the origin and spread of the species in the pantropics. We employed amplified fragment lengths polymorphism (AFLP) and morphometric analyses in a total of 101 C. olitorius accessions. Results of both data sets are mostly congruent. The molecular analysis indicated generally low genetic diversity within populations and the Nei\xe2\x80\x99s gene diversity (He) ranged from 0.0457 to 0.0955 with a mean of 0.0763. Qualitative traits, especially related to leaf morphology, branching habit and stipule color were the taxonomically most informative characters. The highest morphological variability occurred within African accessions, indicating that this species originally evolved in Africa. In both analyses, the Asian materials were nested within African populations, especially with those from North and East Africa. This indicates an African origin of the species and we hypothesise that dispersal occurred via the Mediterranean\xe2\x80\x93Indian trade routes instead of natural migration along the coasts from western Africa to the Indian subcontinent. Both analyses revealed materials from Ethiopia to be quite distinct. The highest number of private bands (N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa035), percent polymorphism (29.29%), and gene diversity (0.0955) were also detected in wild accessions collected from Ethiopia, suggesting a long-term spatial isolation of C. olitorius populations in the country. Germplasm samples from this region could therefore be a useful source of genetic variation in jute breeding programs.'

Title: 'Habitat Preference and Diversity of Anuran in Durgapur, an Industrial City of West Bengal, India'

Abstract: 'Anuran diversity study was conducted for one\xc2\xa0year between June 2008 and August 2009 at Durgapur, an industrial city of West Bengal, India. Nine species under four families of the Order Anura were found to occur in Durgapur. They have a wide range of habitat preference like permanent or temporary aquatic bodies, human residential area, forested areas, termite nest, tree hole, under spaces of logs and so forth. Of the nine sp. 8 were confined to Amarabati pond (site-I), 5 were confined to Durgapur Government College campus (site-II) and 7 were confined at Fuljhore (site-III) of Durgapur. Analysis of the collected data on the anuran community of the study area revealed Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Wiener species diversity index minimum (1.312) at site-II and maximum (1.938) at site-III. In contrast Margalef richness index value was minimum (0.627) at site-II and maximum (1.424) at site-III.'
