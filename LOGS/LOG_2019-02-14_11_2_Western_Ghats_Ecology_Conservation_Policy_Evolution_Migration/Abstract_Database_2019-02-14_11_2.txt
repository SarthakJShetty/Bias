Abstract: 'Ecologically sensitive regions (ESRs) are the \xe2\x80\x98ecological units\xe2\x80\x99 with the exceptional biotic and abiotic elements. Identification of ESRs considering spatially both ecological and social dimensions of environmental variables helps in ecological and conservation planning as per Biodiversity Act, 2002, Government of India. The current research attempts to integrate ecological and environmental considerations into administration, and prioritizes regions at Panchayat levels (local administrative unit) in Uttara Kannada district, Central Western Ghats, Karnataka state considering attributes (biological, Geo-climatic, Social, etc.) as ESR (1\xe2\x80\x934) through weightage score metrics. The region has the distinction of having highest forest area (80.48%) in Karnataka State, India and has been undergoing severe anthropogenic pressures impacting biogeochemistry, hydrology, food security, climate and socio-economic systems. Prioritisation of ESRs helps in the implementation of the sustainable developmental framework with the appropriate conservation strategies through the involvement of local stakeholders.'

Abstract: 'Landscape ecology, inter alia, addresses the question as to how altered landscape patterns affect the distribution, persistence, and abundance of a species. Landscape ecology plays an important role in integrating the different scales of biodiversity from habitat patch to biome level. Satellite remote sensing technology with multi-sensor capabilities offers multi-scale information on landscape composition and configuration. Advances in geospatial analytical tools and spatial statistics have improved the capability to quantify spatial heterogeneity. Globally, landscape level characterization of biodiversity has become an important discipline of science. Considering the vast extent, heterogeneity, and ecological and economic importance of forest landscapes, significant efforts have been made in India during the past decade to strengthen landscape level biodiversity characterization. The generic frame work of studies comprises preparation of national databases providing information on composition and configuration of different landscapes using multi-scale remote sensing techniques, understanding the landscape patterns using geospatial models to elicit disturbance and diversity patterns and application of this information for bioprospecting and conservation purposes. Studies on hierarchical linkage of multi-scale information to study the processes of change, landscape function, dynamics of habitat fragmentation, invasion, development of network of conservation areas based on the understanding of multi-species responses to landscape mosaics, macro-ecological studies to understand environment and species richness, habitat and species transitions and losses, landscape level solutions to adaptation and mitigation strategies to climate change are a few of the future challenges. The paper presents the current experiences and, analyses in conjunction with international scenario and identifies future challenges of Indian landscape level biodiversity studies.'

Abstract: "The Gavlis are a pastoral caste of the forested hill tracts of India 's Western Ghats region. This paper examines their shift under British colonial rule from buffalo-keepers to goatherds to cultivators of increasingly marginal hill tracts, the context of forest exploitation and malaria control as well as more recent dairy development programs of the Indian government. It concludes that if present trends continue Gavlis everywhere will follow the same progression, eventually becoming landless migrants."

Abstract: 'A study was carried out examining the effects of conservation policy on the ecosystem and livelihoods of local people on the Rajiv Gandhi National Park, located in one of the global biodiversity hotspots, the Western Ghats, India. Results show that less than 5% of the people are in favor of the policies while a staggering 94% of the people are strongly against the policies. The remaining 1% of the total respondents are found neutral with regard to conservation policies. Several reasons viz., ban on agriculture, restriction on livestock rearing and grazing, ban on non-timber forest collection, exclusion of local and indigenous communities in conservation programs and tourism activities are found to be responsible for negative attitude towards the national park. Apart from limiting the local livelihood options, the anticipated ecological consequences are not encouraging as exotic species are dominating the vegetation dynamics of the area\xe2\x80\x94replacing many native plant species. The fact is that the inextricable link between nature and society needs an integrated science-policy research approach for biodiversity conservation in the hotspots, particularly in the developing countries where human and ecosystem interactions are much more complex and closely interwoven with each other.'

Abstract: 'Despite a global trend toward settlement, the incidence of pastoral nomadism is on the rise in the Marwar region of Rajasthan, India. Typical explanations for this change use models of population pressure; increasing herds and decreasing pasture are held to blame. This explanation, however intuitive, is unsatisfactory. Instead, changing institutional and economic patterns are creating new contexts for strategic movement. Bottlenecks in the yearly resource calendar, caused by the disintegration of obligatory social relationships, force migrations during periods of scarcity. Changes in the volume and pattern of the meat and wool markets have also created opportunities for migrating pastoralists. Producers increase their access to markets and the reproductive rate of their herd through long, annual, migration. While nomadism is a general adaptation to changes in the socioeconomic conditions of the region, differential resource endowments account for the range of strategies; wealthy herders have opportunities not enjoyed by more marginal producers.'

Title: 'Future of wetlands in tropical and subtropical Asia, especially in the face of climate change'
Author: 'Brij\xc2\xa0Gopal'

Abstract: 'Tropical and subtropical Asia differs from other tropical regions in its monsoonal climate and the dominant influence of the Hindukush and Himalayan mountain ranges which result in extremes of spatial and temporal variability in precipitation. However, several major rivers and their tributaries arise in the Himalayan ranges and are fed by thousands of glaciers. Huge sediment loads carried by these rivers result in important deltas at their mouths. The climatic and physiographic diversity have endowed the region with many kinds of wetlands. Of these, the peatswamps of southeast Asia constitute about 56% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s tropical peatlands, and more than 42% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s mangroves occur in South and southeast Asia. Among other wetlands, riverine swamps are rather restricted whereas the seasonal marshes are a dominant feature. Another characteristic feature of tropical Asia are the innumerable human-made and intensively managed wetlands of which the paddy fields and aquaculture ponds are the most extensive. Throughout tropical Asia, wetlands have been a part of the socio-cultural ethos of the people and many communities have lived in wetlands. However, the pressures of high population and the economic development have extensively impacted upon wetlands which have been transformed for paddy cultivation and aquaculture, drained and converted to other land uses for economic gains (e.g., conversion to oil palm), and degraded by discharge of domestic and industrial wastes. Invasive plant and animal species have also played a significant role. The climate change is already being felt in the rapid retreat of Himalayan glaciers, increased temperature and variability in precipitation as well as the frequency of extreme events. Sea level rise is seen as a major threat to the coastal wetlands, particularly the mangroves. Increasing droughts have caused frequent fires in Indonesian peat swamps that have further feedback impacts on regional climate. However, the actual threat to wetlands in this region arises from the extensive hydrological alterations being caused by storage, abstraction and diversion of river flows for agriculture, industry and hydropower. Currently, the state of our understanding wetlands in general, and the efforts and infrastructure for research and training in wetlands are very poor. Although a few wetlands have been designated as Ramsar sites, the policies aimed at wetland conservation are either non-existent or very weak. Human responses to greater uncertainty and variability in the available water resources in different parts of Asia will be crucial to the conservation of wetlands in the future.'

Abstract: 'A primary need in conserving species and their habitats is defining distinct genetic entities that range from individuals to species to ecosystems and beyond. The development of molecular genetic markers revolutionized the field of fish genetics. Using DNA markers, genetic variation in the entire genome can be analysed and exploited. Here, we outline the molecular genetic methods for species and population identification in fish and their applications to a variety of fisheries management and aquaculture issues with special emphasis on aquatic germplasm resources of India that have enormous potential to contribute to the genetic improvement of species and sustaining threatened wild stocks.'

Title: 'Threatened biotas: "Hot spots" in tropical forests'
Author: 'Norman\xc2\xa0Myers'
Date: 1988-09
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02240252
Abstract: 'The mass-extinction episode underway is largely centred on tropical forests, insofar as they contain at least half of all Earth\'s species and they are being depleted faster than any other biome. But species distributions and depletion patterns are anything but uniform throughout the biome. This paper identifies 10 areas that, a) are characterised by exceptional concentrations of species with high levels of endemism and b) are experiencing unusually rapid rates of depletion. While these "hotspot" areas comprise less than 3.5 percent of remaining primary forests, they harbour over 34 000 endemic plant species (27 percent of all plant species in tropical forests and 13 percent of all plant species worldwide). They also feature 700 000 endemic animal species and possibly several times more. Unfortunately, they appear likely to lose 90 percent of their forest cover as soon as the end of the century or shortly thereafter, causing the extinction of almost 7 percent of Earth\'s plant species and at least a similar proportion of animal species, this occurring in only 0.2 percent of Earth\'s land surface. By concentrating on such areas where needs are greatestand where the pay-off from safeguard measures would also be greatest, conservationists can engage in a more systematised response to the challenge of largescale extinctions impending in tropical forests.'

Abstract: 'The object of the paper is to provide an insight into the changes in livelihood strategies of the people in the Garhwal Himalayas over time. From sustaining an economy based on transit trade and subsistence agriculture, there has been a shift towards tourism in recent times. This shift has been due to the tradition of pilgrimage to the higher reaches and also due to promotion by the state by developing infrastructure and providing incentives.'

Title: 'Three decades of wildlife radio telemetry in India: a review'
Author: 'Bilal\xc2\xa0Habib'

URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2050-3385-2-4
Abstract: 'From 1983, there have been three decades of the application and development of radio telemetry for wildlife studies in India. In this article, we review 82 studies from India, covering 47 species from four taxonomic classes. We examine and discuss the trends in the selection of study species, habitats and objectives of radio-telemetry studies and the functional success of radio collars and tags. A strong bias for study species and study region is observed and researchers generally tend not to look beyond the traditional research questions. Habitats that are difficult to access, such as the Trans-Himalayas, the Himalayas and north-eastern India, are overlooked. Most of the studies aimed to infer primary information only, such as home range, migration and movement patterns and habitat preference (53.7%, 47.6% and 28.1% studies, respectively). We expect these trends to change with time as the development of technology allows researchers to explore further. We investigated the tracking histories of 483 animals and the records of 496 radio collars or tags, but detailed information could be acquired for only 330 collars or tags. Of the collars, 49% malfunctioned before the end of their anticipated life due to a variety of reasons, early battery drainage being the prevalent cause. The performance of different technologies and collar manufacturers was also analysed but the small sample size was an issue for most of the cases. Argos-based collars and tags generally failed to record most of the locations precisely and failed to transmit them successfully. Issues with permissions and capturing animals for tagging, particular to India, are also discussed. A uniform and centralized system for granting permissions and guidelines for capturing and handling animals would be beneficial to future telemetry studies.'

Title: "Consensus of the 'Malasars' traditional aboriginal knowledge of medicinal plants in the Velliangiri holy hills, India"

Abstract: 'There are many vanishing cultures that possess a wealth of knowledge on the medicinal utility of plants. The Malasars of Dravidian Tamils are an indigenous society occupying the forests of the Western Ghats, South India. They are known to be exceptional healers and keepers of traditional aboriginal knowledge (TAK) of the flora in the Velliangiri holy hills. In fact, their expertise is well known throughout India as evidenced by the thousands of pilgrims that go to the Velliangiri holy hills for healing every year. Our research is the first detailed study of medicinal plants in India that considers variation in TAK among informants using a quantitative consensus analysis. A total of 95 species belonging to 50 families were identified for medicinal and general health purposes. For each species the botanical name, family, local name, parts used, summary of mode of preparation, administration and curing are provided. The consensus analysis revealed a high level of agreement among the informants usage of a particular plant at a local scale. The average consensus index value of an informant was FIC > 0.71, and over 0.80 for some ailments such as respiratory and jaundice. Some of the more common problems faced by the Malasars were gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory illness, dermatological problems and simple illness such as fever, cough, cold, wounds and bites from poisonous animals. We also discovered several new ethnotaxa that have considerable medicinal utility. This study supports claims that the Malasars possess a rich TAK of medicinal plants and that many aboriginals and mainstream people (pilgrims) utilize medicinal plants of the Velliangiri holy hills. Unfortunately, the younger generation of Malasars are not embracing TAK as they tend to migrate towards lucrative jobs in more developed urban areas. Our research sheds some light on a traditional culture that believes that a healthy lifestyle is founded on a healthy environment and we suggest that TAK such as that of the Malasars may serve toward a global lifestyle of health and environmental sustainability.'

Abstract: 'NORMAN MYERS: An honorary visiting fellow at Green College. He is an independent scientist and consultant working in environment and development.Like most other environmental and economic sectors, forestry worldwide looks set to encounter a growing number of surprises in the sense of major divergencies from established trends. These surprises will be largely environmental or economic or both at once. Unless we do a better job of identifying them ahead of time, these surprises will often be of a scale to overwhelm our anticipatory and preventive capacities. Indeed and as this paper demonstrates, the most likely as well as the most taxing forestry problems of the future will often be the ones we have scarcely thought of. Fortunately, the same applies to forestry opportunities. In these circumstances, there is a premium on not only supplying answers to recognized questions but on raising entirely new questions.'

However, several major rivers and their tributaries arise in the Himalayan ranges and are fed by thousands of glaciers. Huge sediment loads carried by these rivers result in important deltas at their mouths. The climatic and physiographic diversity have endowed the region with many kinds of wetlands. Of these, the peatswamps of southeast Asia constitute about 56% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s tropical peatlands, and more than 42% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s mangroves occur in South and southeast Asia. Among other wetlands, riverine swamps are rather restricted whereas the seasonal marshes are a dominant feature. Another characteristic feature of tropical Asia are the innumerable human-made and intensively managed wetlands of which the paddy fields and aquaculture ponds are the most extensive. Throughout tropical Asia, wetlands have been a part of the socio-cultural ethos of the people and many communities have lived in wetlands. However, the pressures of high population and the economic development have extensively impacted upon wetlands which have been transformed for paddy cultivation and aquaculture, drained and converted to other land uses for economic gains (e.g., conversion to oil palm), and degraded by discharge of domestic and industrial wastes. Invasive plant and animal species have also played a significant role. The climate change is already being felt in the rapid retreat of Himalayan glaciers, increased temperature and variability in precipitation as well as the frequency of extreme events. Sea level rise is seen as a major threat to the coastal wetlands, particularly the mangroves. Increasing droughts have caused frequent fires in Indonesian peat swamps that have further feedback impacts on regional climate. However, the actual threat to wetlands in this region arises from the extensive hydrological alterations being caused by storage, abstraction and diversion of river flows for agriculture, industry and hydropower. Currently, the state of our understanding wetlands in general, and the efforts and infrastructure for research and training in wetlands are very poor. Although a few wetlands have been designated as Ramsar sites, the policies aimed at wetland conservation are either non-existent or very weak. Human responses to greater uncertainty and variability in the available water resources in different parts of Asia will be crucial to the conservation of wetlands in the future.'

Abstract: 'A primary need in conserving species and their habitats is defining distinct genetic entities that range from individuals to species to ecosystems and beyond. The development of molecular genetic markers revolutionized the field of fish genetics. Using DNA markers, genetic variation in the entire genome can be analysed and exploited. Here, we outline the molecular genetic methods for species and population identification in fish and their applications to a variety of fisheries management and aquaculture issues with special emphasis on aquatic germplasm resources of India that have enormous potential to contribute to the genetic improvement of species and sustaining threatened wild stocks.'

Title: 'Threatened biotas: "Hot spots" in tropical forests'
Author: 'Norman\xc2\xa0Myers'
Date: 1988-09
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02240252
Abstract: 'The mass-extinction episode underway is largely centred on tropical forests, insofar as they contain at least half of all Earth\'s species and they are being depleted faster than any other biome. But species distributions and depletion patterns are anything but uniform throughout the biome. This paper identifies 10 areas that, a) are characterised by exceptional concentrations of species with high levels of endemism and b) are experiencing unusually rapid rates of depletion. While these "hotspot" areas comprise less than 3.5 percent of remaining primary forests, they harbour over 34 000 endemic plant species (27 percent of all plant species in tropical forests and 13 percent of all plant species worldwide). They also feature 700 000 endemic animal species and possibly several times more. Unfortunately, they appear likely to lose 90 percent of their forest cover as soon as the end of the century or shortly thereafter, causing the extinction of almost 7 percent of Earth\'s plant species and at least a similar proportion of animal species, this occurring in only 0.2 percent of Earth\'s land surface. By concentrating on such areas where needs are greatestand where the pay-off from safeguard measures would also be greatest, conservationists can engage in a more systematised response to the challenge of largescale extinctions impending in tropical forests.'

Abstract: 'The object of the paper is to provide an insight into the changes in livelihood strategies of the people in the Garhwal Himalayas over time. From sustaining an economy based on transit trade and subsistence agriculture, there has been a shift towards tourism in recent times. This shift has been due to the tradition of pilgrimage to the higher reaches and also due to promotion by the state by developing infrastructure and providing incentives.'

Title: 'Three decades of wildlife radio telemetry in India: a review'

Abstract: 'From 1983, there have been three decades of the application and development of radio telemetry for wildlife studies in India. In this article, we review 82 studies from India, covering 47 species from four taxonomic classes. We examine and discuss the trends in the selection of study species, habitats and objectives of radio-telemetry studies and the functional success of radio collars and tags. A strong bias for study species and study region is observed and researchers generally tend not to look beyond the traditional research questions. Habitats that are difficult to access, such as the Trans-Himalayas, the Himalayas and north-eastern India, are overlooked. Most of the studies aimed to infer primary information only, such as home range, migration and movement patterns and habitat preference (53.7%, 47.6% and 28.1% studies, respectively). We expect these trends to change with time as the development of technology allows researchers to explore further. We investigated the tracking histories of 483 animals and the records of 496 radio collars or tags, but detailed information could be acquired for only 330 collars or tags. Of the collars, 49% malfunctioned before the end of their anticipated life due to a variety of reasons, early battery drainage being the prevalent cause. The performance of different technologies and collar manufacturers was also analysed but the small sample size was an issue for most of the cases. Argos-based collars and tags generally failed to record most of the locations precisely and failed to transmit them successfully. Issues with permissions and capturing animals for tagging, particular to India, are also discussed. A uniform and centralized system for granting permissions and guidelines for capturing and handling animals would be beneficial to future telemetry studies.'

Title: "Consensus of the 'Malasars' traditional aboriginal knowledge of medicinal plants in the Velliangiri holy hills, India"

Abstract: 'There are many vanishing cultures that possess a wealth of knowledge on the medicinal utility of plants. The Malasars of Dravidian Tamils are an indigenous society occupying the forests of the Western Ghats, South India. They are known to be exceptional healers and keepers of traditional aboriginal knowledge (TAK) of the flora in the Velliangiri holy hills. In fact, their expertise is well known throughout India as evidenced by the thousands of pilgrims that go to the Velliangiri holy hills for healing every year. Our research is the first detailed study of medicinal plants in India that considers variation in TAK among informants using a quantitative consensus analysis. A total of 95 species belonging to 50 families were identified for medicinal and general health purposes. For each species the botanical name, family, local name, parts used, summary of mode of preparation, administration and curing are provided. The consensus analysis revealed a high level of agreement among the informants usage of a particular plant at a local scale. The average consensus index value of an informant was FIC > 0.71, and over 0.80 for some ailments such as respiratory and jaundice. Some of the more common problems faced by the Malasars were gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory illness, dermatological problems and simple illness such as fever, cough, cold, wounds and bites from poisonous animals. We also discovered several new ethnotaxa that have considerable medicinal utility. This study supports claims that the Malasars possess a rich TAK of medicinal plants and that many aboriginals and mainstream people (pilgrims) utilize medicinal plants of the Velliangiri holy hills. Unfortunately, the younger generation of Malasars are not embracing TAK as they tend to migrate towards lucrative jobs in more developed urban areas. Our research sheds some light on a traditional culture that believes that a healthy lifestyle is founded on a healthy environment and we suggest that TAK such as that of the Malasars may serve toward a global lifestyle of health and environmental sustainability.'

Abstract: 'NORMAN MYERS: An honorary visiting fellow at Green College. He is an independent scientist and consultant working in environment and development.Like most other environmental and economic sectors, forestry worldwide looks set to encounter a growing number of surprises in the sense of major divergencies from established trends. These surprises will be largely environmental or economic or both at once. Unless we do a better job of identifying them ahead of time, these surprises will often be of a scale to overwhelm our anticipatory and preventive capacities. Indeed and as this paper demonstrates, the most likely as well as the most taxing forestry problems of the future will often be the ones we have scarcely thought of. Fortunately, the same applies to forestry opportunities. In these circumstances, there is a premium on not only supplying answers to recognized questions but on raising entirely new questions.'

Abstract: 'The Nilwala Ganga Basin of Sri Lanka includes important natural wetlands that are habitat for vulnerable animal and plant species. Flood protection and intensive rice production in the Basin have resulted in degraded acid soils and declining rice yields. However, traditional \xe2\x80\x98maavee\xe2\x80\x99 rice production outside the flood protection scheme has continued to generate a high-value rice product. This study reports on interviews conducted with farmers and other stakeholders to document the production practices and the potential environmental and economic benefits associated with maavee rice paddies. The maavee production system has prevailed for at least several decades. Farmers apply no chemicals to their paddies, relying instead on alluvial deposits as a source of nutrients, and on the natural pest and disease resistance of their traditional varieties. The maavee rice product can attain three times the selling price of rice from conventional farms making it more economically viable than conventional rice production. However, much of maavee production is for home consumption and the system is threatened by increasing labour costs, an ageing farming population and pressures to increase rice yields. Non-invasive production practices and the proximity of maavee paddies to regenerating wetlands in the Kirala Kele Sanctuary suggest that traditional paddies may constitute an important habitat for vulnerable wildlife; however, maavee farmers also perceive wetland birds as potentially damaging to rice. Based on a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis, we make recommendations for future research needs and potential management actions to safeguard the environmental and economic sustainability of the maavee system.'

Abstract: 'Forest fire has profound impacts on atmospheric chemistry, biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem structure. This feedback interaction may be hastened in climate change scenarios. In view of this, the present day knowledge about the forest fire condition in India has been reviewed. Operational monitoring, geospatial modelling and climate change uncertainties are discussed. Indicators for forest fire assessment and the role of geoinformatics tools in developing those parameters are identified. The need for developing an adaptive management strategy from the existing experience is emphasized, and specific points are recommended sector-wise with short- and long-term visions.'

Abstract: 'We examine the dynamics and spatial determinants of land change in India by integrating decadal land cover maps (1985\xe2\x80\x931995\xe2\x80\x932005) from a wall-to-wall analysis of Landsat images with spatiotemporal socioeconomic database for ~630,000 villages in India. We reinforce our results through collective evidence from synthesis of 102 case studies that incorporate field knowledge of the causes of land change in India. We focus on cropland\xe2\x80\x93fallow land conversions, and forest area changes (excludes non-forest tree categories including commercial plantations). We show that cropland to fallow conversions are prominently associated with lack of irrigation and capital, male agricultural labor shortage, and fragmentation of land holdings. We find gross forest loss is substantial and increased from ~23,810\xc2\xa0km2 (1985\xe2\x80\x931995) to ~25,770\xc2\xa0km2 (1995\xe2\x80\x932005). The gross forest gain also increased from ~6000\xc2\xa0km2 (1985\xe2\x80\x931995) to ~7440\xc2\xa0km2 (1995\xe2\x80\x932005). Overall, India experienced a net decline in forest by ~18,000\xc2\xa0km2 (gross loss\xe2\x80\x93gross gain) consistently during both decades. We show that the major source of forest loss was cropland expansion in areas of low cropland productivity (due to soil degradation and lack of irrigation), followed by industrial development and mining/quarrying activities, and excessive economic dependence of villages on forest resources.'

Abstract: 'High densities of people living around protected areas (PAs) in South Asia require management strategies to balance conservation goals and livelihood needs. Based on a survey of 777 households around five PAs in India and Nepal, this paper provides a comparative perspective of Indian and Nepali households\xe2\x80\x99 views of protected area benefits and costs, their attitude toward conservation in general, and attitude toward protected area staff. Results indicate mixed responses towards tourism, varying from very favorable in Nepal to less favorable in India. The majority (81%) held positive attitudes towards the existence and importance of PAs but had negative perceptions of PA staff (69%). Most residents perceived benefits from access to fuel wood, fodder and other PA resources including benefits from tourism, while crop and livestock losses from wildlife were the main costs. Households overall positive attitudes towards the PAs and conservation despite high losses from living around PAs suggests that local residents may support conservation if their livelihood needs are met. Comparisons of household attitudes and perceptions suggest that locally based strategies rather than top-down approaches are likely to be more effective. Extending PA benefits to smaller landholders, households that are highly resource-dependent or experiencing higher income losses from human-wildlife conflicts, and less educated residents are particularly important to balance costs and losses from living around protected areas.'

Title: 'Habitat evaluation using suitability index and habitat type diversity: a case study involving a shallow forest stream in central Taiwan'
Author: 'Wen-Chieh\xc2\xa0Chou'

Abstract: 'In recent years, the Taiwanese government has strongly promoted the concept of ecological engineering in the hope that doing so will encourage the maintenance of the ecosystem and its integrity. As a result, the riprap spur dike is one of the most commonly used measures for protecting stream banks. Traditionally, a spur dike is used at concave banks to prevent their scouring and/or to increase their stabilization. An additional benefit of deflector structures, like spur dikes, may be to increase the weighted usable area (WUA) for aquatic life survival during periods of increased flow (examples include typhoon, flood, etc.). A two-dimensional river habitat simulation program (River2D) coupled with a developed shallow water habitat type diversity module was used for the case study at a headwater stream in central Taiwan. The habitat suitability index for this study was established using substrate, depth, and velocity from field surveys for the fish family Cyprinidae by prepositioned area electrofisher. The ungauged flood conditions were calculated using digital elevation models within a watershed delineation and hydrological modeling system in accordance with local regulations. Simulated results indicate that the spur dikes currently in use on the stream in this study need be improved from a WUA point of view more effectively handle a flood event.'
