Abstract: 'SummaryThe articulation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is composed of the temporal bone dorsally, the mandibular condyle ventrally and a fibrous articular disc. The TMJ disc plays an essential role in distributing load between the two articular surfaces. Degeneration of the disc in the presence of joint pathology has been shown in man; however, TMJ pathology has not been documented previously in tigers (Panthera tigris). The mandibular condyle and TMJ disc of a Bengal tiger (P. tigris tigris) and a Siberian tiger (P. tigris altaica) were evaluated grossly and the TMJ disc was characterized biochemically and mechanically. Characterization of the TMJ disc verified region- and direction-dependent biochemical and mechanical properties, reflective of the functional demands on the joint. Degenerative joint disease was observed in both cases and this was more severe in the Siberian tiger. Simultaneous evaluation of joint pathology, biochemical composition and mechanical properties of the TMJ disc revealed a loss in functional properties (tensile anisotropy) of the disc as joint pathology advanced from moderate to severe. TMJ degeneration may compromise the ability of the animal to eat and thrive and may be a factor contributing to the endangered status of these species.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Faecal cortisol metabolite (FCM) EIA was validated for the Tiger.\xe2\x80\xa2Blood sampling increased FCM in 1\xc2\xa0day, reaching baseline in 5\xc2\xa0days.\xe2\x80\xa289% recovery of the cortisol standard against tiger faecal extract.\xe2\x80\xa2Significant effect of sex of FCMs, not significant between sub-species.\xe2\x80\xa2Tigers with health problems had higher FCM levels than healthy ones.AbstractThe tiger (Panthera tigris) faces a great risk of extinction as its wild numbers have plummeted due to poaching and habitat destruction so ex-situ conservation programs are becoming ever more necessary. Reliable non-invasive biomarkers of the stress hormone (cortisol) are necessary for assessing the health and welfare of tigers in captivity. To our knowledge, non-invasive stress endocrinology methods have not been tested as widely in tigers. The first aim of this study was to describe and validate a faecal cortisol metabolite enzyme-immmunoassay (FCM EIA) for two tiger sub-species, the Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) and the Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae). Individual tigers (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa022) were studied in two large Zoos in Queensland, Australia (Dreamworld Theme Park and Australia Zoo). Fresh faecal samples (<12\xc2\xa0h old) were collected each morning from both Zoos over a study period of 21\xc2\xa0days. Biological validation was conducted separately by collecting feces 5\xc2\xa0days before and 5\xc2\xa0days after blood was taken from four male and five female tigers. Results showed that mean FCM levels increased by 138% and 285% in the male and female tigers within 1\xc2\xa0day after bloods were taken, returning to baseline in 5\xc2\xa0days. Laboratory validations of the FCM EIA were done using an extraction efficiency test and parallelism. Results showed >89% recovery of the cortisol standard that was added to tiger faecal extract. We also obtained parallel displacement of the serially diluted cortisol standard against serially diluted tiger faecal extract. Our second aim was to determine whether the FCM levels were significantly different between tiger sub-species and sex. Results showed no significant difference in mean FCM levels between the Bengal and Sumatran tiger sub-species. Mean levels of FCMs were significantly higher in females than in male tigers. Those male and female tigers with reported health issues during the study period expressed higher FCM levels than the reportedly healthy tigers. Interestingly, those tigers that took part in some activity (such as walks, photos, presentations and guest feeds) expressed moderately higher FCM levels at Dreamworld and lower FCM levels at Australia Zoo in comparison to those tigers that did not take part in such activities. These results indicate potential habituation in some tigers for routine activity through specialized training and pre-conditioning. In conclusion, the FCM EIA described in this study provides a reliable non-invasive method for evaluating the stress status of tigers in Zoos.'

Title: 'Evaluating the effect of forest loss and agricultural expansion on Sumatran tigers from scat surveys'
Author: 'Olutolani'

Abstract: 'AbstractSumatran tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae) are a critically endangered carnivore restricted to the island of Sumatra, and like many other large mammals on the Indonesian archipelago, they are threatened by high levels of poaching and widespread habitat degradation. Here, we conduct the first range-wide assessment of Sumatran tiger genetics using scat surveys and show that the wild population retains levels of genetic heterozygosity comparable to mainland tigers. However, the population also exhibits signs of subdivision due to the unprecedented rates of deforestation and land conversion in the last 30\xe2\x80\x9340\xe2\x80\xafyears. The fact that this subspecies retains such levels of heterozygosity despite high rates of habitat loss and increasing isolation suggests a form of genetic extinction debt with an elevated risk of extinction if no action is taken within the next 30\xe2\x80\x93100\xe2\x80\xafyears (see Kenney et al., 2014). However, the inherent time delay in extinction debt provides opportunities for conservation if habitat quality can be improved and connections between existing population fragments can be made. Our study highlights the importance of genetic studies for providing baseline information to improve the population management of highly threatened carnivore species. Mitigating further habitat degradation and expansion of oil palm and other cash crops in this region would improve the viability not only of Sumatran tiger populations, but of other threatened large mammal species as well.'

Title: 'Original InvestigationGenetically distinct population of Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) in Terai Arc Landscape (TAL) of India'
Author: 'Reeta'

Abstract: 'AbstractWe analyzed mtDNA polymorphisms (a total of 741\xc2\xa0bp from a part of conserved control region, ND5, ND2, Cyt b and 12S) in 91 scats and 12 tissue samples of Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) populations across Terai Arc Landscape (TAL) located at the foothills of Himalayas in North Western India, Buxa Tiger Reserve (BTR), and North East India. In TAL and BTR, we found a specific haplotype at high frequency, which was absent elsewhere, indicating a genetically distinct population in these regions. Within the TAL region, there is some evidence for genetic isolation of the tiger populations west of river Ganges, i.e., in the western part of Rajaji National Park (RNP). Although the river itself might not constitute a significant barrier for tigers, recent human-induced changes in habitat and degradation of the Motichur-Chilla Corridor connecting the two sides of the tiger habitat of RNP might effectively prevent genetic exchange. A cohesive population is observed for the rest of the TAL. Even the more eastern BTR belongs genetically to this unit, despite the present lack of a migration corridor between BTR and TAL. In spite of a close geographic proximity, Chitwan (Nepal) constitutes a tiger population genetically different from TAL. Moreover, it is observed that the North East India tiger populations are genetically different from TAL and BTR, as well as from the other Bengal tiger populations in India.'

Abstract: 'AbstractSurvey on the occurrence of marine fishes of the northern Bay of West Bengal coast was conducted during the period of more than 2\xc2\xa0years 2014 and 2016 along 158\xc2\xa0km coastline area. To collect data 9 major fish landing stations viz. Digha, Digha Mohana, Shankarpur, Petuaghat, Sagar, Fresergunge, Namkhana, Kakdwip and Diamond Harbour were selected at a distance between 1.5\xc2\xa0km and 36\xc2\xa0km between the landing stations. It is revealed that, at least 314 fish species are involved with the marine ecosystems in respect to fishing zone of West Bengal coast. Of these 314 species status of 209 (66.56%) species is yet to be determined in respect to IUCN guidelines while in case of 14 (4.46%) species certain information are still needed to evaluate their status. Of the remaining 103 species 58 (18.47%) are LC, 20 (6.37%) are NT, 7 (2.23%) are VU, 3 (0.95%) are EN and 3 (0.95%) are CR species. From the collected data it is evident that, there exists clear compartmentalization of certain fish species in respect to certain netting zones locating at distant places. Therefore, the strategy for conservation and management of marine fishes in the Bay of Bengal fishing area be formulated by considering the economic status of the fishing community and the IUCN status of the fish species that are most susceptible to capture by the fishermen.'

Title: 'OpinionQuantifying Temporal Genomic Erosion in Endangered Species'

Abstract: 'HighlightsThe small population size of many endangered species makes them vulnerable to genetic threats, such as inbreeding depression, loss of genetic variation, and accumulation of deleterious mutationsPresent-day genome-wide diversity is a poor predictor of population size and conservation status in endangered species, making interspecific comparisons of genomic data inadequate indicators of extinction risk.Historical specimens in museum collections include samples that pre-date the demographic declines that have occurred in recent centuries and, thus, can provide baseline levels of diversity, inbreeding, and genetic load.Temporal genomic indices based on comparisons of historical and present-day samples are powerful tools to estimate genomic erosion, and could be integrated with other IUCN Red List criteria to assess threat levels in endangered species.Many species have undergone dramatic population size declines over the past centuries. Although stochastic genetic processes during and after such declines are thought to elevate the risk of extinction, comparative analyses of genomic data from several endangered species suggest little concordance between genome-wide diversity and current population sizes. This is likely because species-specific life-history traits and ancient bottlenecks overshadow the genetic effect of recent demographic declines. Therefore, we advocate that temporal sampling of genomic data provides a more accurate approach to quantify genetic threats in endangered species. Specifically, genomic data from predecline museum specimens will provide valuable baseline data that enable accurate estimation of recent decreases in genome-wide diversity, increases in inbreeding levels, and accumulation of deleterious genetic variation.'

Abstract: 'AbstractHepatozoon species are parasites that infect a wide variety of domestic and wild animals. The objective of this study was to perform the molecular detection and characterization of Hepatozoon spp. in Asiatic lion, Indian tiger, Indian leopard, Indian wild dog, Indian domestic dog and cat based on partial 18S rRNA gene sequences from Hepatozoon spp. in the naturally infected animals. Hepatozoon spp. could be detected in blood samples of 5 out of 9 Asiatic lions, 2 out of 5 Indian tigers, 2 out of 4 Indian leopards and 2 out of 2 Indian wild dogs and, 2 out of 4 domestic cats and 2 out of 3 domestic dog samples by PCR. Sequencing of PCR amplicon and BLAST analysis of partial 18S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the Hepatozoon spp. in Asiatic lion, Bengal tiger, Indian leopard and domestic cat was Hepatozoon felis (98\xe2\x80\x9399% similarity) and in the Indian wild and domestic dog the phylogenetic neighbour was Hepatozoon canis (97\xe2\x80\x93100% similarity). Presence of H. felis and H. canis in both domestic and wild animals suggested that they are not host specific and the same parasite causes infection in domestic and wild felids and canids in India and from different parts of the world. To our knowledge, this is the first report on detection and molecular characterization of H. felis infection in Asiatic lions, Indian tigers, Indian leopards and H. canis in Indian wild dog. Hepatozoon spp. may be a potential pathogen and an opportunistic parasite in immuno-compromised animals and could thus represent a threat to endangered Indian wild felids and canids.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Captive-born tigers killed free-ranging prey in the South African veld.\xe2\x80\xa2The presence of stalking cover was related to higher kill rates in tigers.\xe2\x80\xa2Tigers were able to kill several prey species, showing behavioral plasticity\xe2\x80\xa2Being raised by a mother increased tiger kill rate but was not essentialAbstractThe South China tiger (Panthera tigris amoyensis), although listed by the IUCN as critically endangered, is probably extinct in the wild. This leaves captive-born animals as the only stock available for reintroductions. Because reintroduced tigers will not survive in the wild unless they hunt proficiently, we aimed to determine whether captive-born tigers were able to hunt free-ranging prey and to evaluate their hunting performance as a criterion for reintroduction. The effect of other variables on subsequent hunting success, such as the availability of stalking cover and the upbringing history of tigers while they were cubs were also explored, given their relevance in reintroduction programs. Twelve tigers over two years of age were fitted with GPS collars and placed individually in 100\xc2\xa0ha enclosures to determine their kill rate of blesbuck (Damaliscus pygargus), as a measure of their hunting performance. All tigers but one successfully hunted blesbuck, although kill rate varied substantially amongst individuals, ranging from one blesbuck every 3.14\xc2\xa0days to no blesbuck. Tigers also killed other species indicating plasticity in their hunting behavior, and showed higher kill rates in the enclosure where cover was more abundant, confirming the importance of stalking cover in hunting success for this species. Results showed that the presence of the mother during cub development was not necessary for cubs to hunt later in life, although it had a positive effect on kill rate. Our study represents the first empirical evidence that captive-born tigers can successfully hunt free-ranging prey adequately to meet their energetic demands, validating the use of captive animals to recover wild populations, should other reintroduction criteria be met. Moreover, that tigers adapted to the African veld ecoregion suggests they should be able to adapt back to southern China where opportunities for stalking and ambush are more numerous.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Increasing prey is crucial to recovering wild tiger numbers because prey density is a key determinant of tiger density.\xe2\x80\xa2Using data from GPS collared tigers, we developed an energetics model to estimate requirements for survival and reproduction.\xe2\x80\xa2Our model underestimated empirical consumption rates, emphasizing that tigers are likely consuming more prey than predicted.\xe2\x80\xa2High densities of preferred prey are critical for reproducing but abundant small prey will not ensure successful reproduction.\xe2\x80\xa2To raise cubs to independence, a highly reproductive tigress will need 2\xe2\x80\x933 times more biomass than a solitary tigress.AbstractThe Global Tiger Recovery Program has identified increasing prey populations as a crucial component of recovering wild tiger numbers because prey density is a key determinant of tiger density, especially for Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) living at the northern limit of tiger distribution, where both tiger and prey densities are the lowest range wide. To understand potential prey requirements for Amur tigers, we developed a predictive energetics model based on allometric scaling and literature values for the costs of reproduction to estimate energetic requirements. We parameterized the energetics model with empirical activity budgets and movement rates estimated from 5\xc2\xa0GPS radiocollared tigers between 2009 and 2013. To avoid starvation, adult male tigers must consume a minimum of 5.2\xc2\xa0kg/day, non-reproducing adult females 3.9\xc2\xa0kg/day, and an adult female raising 4 cubs to independence needs 200% more energy, or an average of 11.4\xc2\xa0kg/day over the 651\xc2\xa0day reproduction period. Given knowledge of Amur tiger diet composition and prey biomass in the Russian Far East, male tigers would consume 24.8\xc2\xa0prey per year, non-reproducing females 18.2\xc2\xa0prey per year, and a female raising 4 cubs 53.8\xc2\xa0prey per year. However, our energetics model underestimated empirical consumption rates, emphasizing that while the relative costs of reproduction are valid, wild tigers are likely consuming more prey than predicted by basal metabolic demands alone. Quantifying the energetic requirements of tigers allows resource managers to estimate nutritional carrying capacity, estimate the impact of tigers on prey, and develop science-based conservation recommendations.'

Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) was the predominant contaminant with a mean serum concentration of 1.18\xc2\xa0ng\xc2\xa0mL\xe2\x88\x921 in tigers and 2.69\xc2\xa0ng\xc2\xa0mL\xe2\x88\x921 in lions. Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was the second most prevalent contaminant in both species. The composition profiles of the tested PFCs differed between tigers and lions, and the percentages of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were greater in lions than in tigers, indicating different exposures and/or metabolic capabilities between the two species. Assessments of the risk of PFC contamination to the two species were obtained by comparing measured concentrations to points of departure or toxicity reference values (TRVs). Results suggest no risk of PFOS exposure or toxicity for the two species.'

Abstract: 'Publisher SummaryThis chapter addresses the challenges faced by wild tiger populations and the various strategies used by tiger conservationists to study and conserve the critically endangered cats in nature. Three observations are shown. First, over the past 20 years, despite tremendous energy and efforts, unprecedented funding, and innovative programs, wild tiger populations everywhere, except in Russia, have declined. In some locations, these losses were dramatic. Second, managing putative tiger subspecies is a significant challenge for zoos due to limited space, and successful reintroduction protocols for captive-reared tigers have yet to be established. Third, tigers are orange with black stripes. This chapter proposes taxonomy of captive tiger owners and discusses the history and growth of captive tiger ownership, with particular emphasis in the United States. It identifies the most important \xe2\x80\x9cobvious and acute problems\xe2\x80\x9d associated with captive tigers; and introduces a new class of \xe2\x80\x9csubtle and chronic\xe2\x80\x9d problems associated with captive tigers. The first systematic estimate of the global captive tiger population is presented. Finally, this chapter concludes with a brief discussion of why one believes that anyone who cares about tigers needs to confront the growth, and economic and political influence, of irresponsible tiger ownership.'

Abstract: 'AbstractInternational forest and environmental governance processes assume that ideas and concepts surrounding biodiversity at the international level will be made accessible at a national level so that they can be easily adopted by national forest and environmental policy arenas. One prerequisite for a seamless implementation of these ideas and concepts is a common definition of specific problems at different political levels. Different perceptions mirrored by media reporting on problems at different political levels may affect the implementation of policies that must be carried out at a national level, even if decisions concerning this implementation are made at an international level. Using the illustrative case of human\xe2\x80\x93tiger interaction, this article shows how national and international media reporting differ in their framing of a particular problem. Based on a theoretical framework consisting framing and media selection theory, and on initial empirical observations, the article recommends blueprints for future in-depth research on the relationship between media framing and policy at different political levels. This case study is based on quantitative content analysis of reports on tiger\xe2\x80\x93human interaction published between 2005 and 2010 in an international newspaper and a national one from Bangladesh. Our example shows that the selected national newspaper frames the tiger as a threat to the livelihood and well-being of local people, whereas the international newspaper stresses biodiversity and climate-change related aspects of human\xe2\x80\x93tiger conflicts. These results indicate that the framing of an issue in the media can differ considerably at different levels and that this is a fruitful field for future in-depth research.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The study identifies the factors affecting household attitude towards relocation and assesses the impact of relocation on the livelihood of relocated tribal households.\xe2\x80\xa2While, share of income from agriculture, livestock and forests are found to be higher for the inside households,wage labor constitute the significant share of income for the relocated households.\xe2\x80\xa2Male, younger and educated people are more willing to relocate from the core area of the Similipal Tiger Reserve.\xe2\x80\xa2Adequate provision of technical and financial inputs for the creation of better agricultural livelihoods for the relocated people is essential for the successful implementation of relocation mechanism.\xe2\x80\xa2A \xe2\x80\x98bottom-up\xe2\x80\x99 approach would be more effective while addressing the issue concerning biodiversity conservation.AbstractThe paper examines (i) the factors affecting households\xe2\x80\x99 attitude towards conservation and relocation and (ii) the impact of relocation on the livelihood of displaced tribal communities of Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR) in India. The study uses primary data collected from 40 relocated households and compares them with 61 non-relocated households currently residing inside the core zone of STR. The study finds that the average share of income from agriculture, livestock and non-timber forest products are relatively higher in case of households residing inside the core area. Conversely, income derived from non-agricultural wage labour contributes maximum to the total income of the relocated households. Although access to educational facilities, transport and health care are reported to be some of the immediate benefits after relocation, food security of the displaced households is found to be adversely affected due to reduced crop diversity and output. The econometric results find that the working-age population and the literates in the region are more willing to relocate from the reserve. Particularly, the male members in the community are more desirous of participating in the relocation process and reaping the associated benefits as opposed to their female counterparts. The study gainsays the existing conservation paradigm via relocation and suggests that participatory capacity building of the affected community alongside consultation with all the stakeholders can go a long way in achieving the twin objectives of biodiversity conservation and local livelihood promotion.'

Title: 'AnalysisCan domestication of wildlife lead to conservation? The economics of tiger farming in China\xe2\x98\x86'
Author: 'Brant'

Abstract: 'AbstractTigers are a threatened species that might soon disappear in the wild. Not only are tigers threatened by deteriorating and declining habitat, but poachers continue to kill tigers for traditional medicine, decoration pieces and so on. Although international trade in tiger products has been banned since 1987 and domestic trade within China since 1993, tigers continue to be poached and Chinese entrepreneurs have established tiger farms in anticipation of their demise. While China desires to permit sale of tiger products from captive-bred tigers, this is opposed on the grounds that it likely encourages illegal killing. Instead, wildlife conservationists lobby for more spending on anti-poaching and trade-ban enforcement. In this study, a mathematical bioeconomic model is used to investigate the issue. Simulation results indicate that, unless range states are characterized by institutions (rule of law and low corruption) similar to those found in the richest countries, reliance on enforcement alone is insufficient to guarantee survival of wild tigers. Likewise, even though conservation payments could protect wild tigers, the inability to enforce contracts militates against this. Our model indicates that wild tigers can be protected by permitting sale of products from tiger farms, although this likely requires the granting of an exclusive license to sellers. Finally, it is possible to tradeoff enforcement effort and sale of products from captive-bred animals, but such tradeoffs are worsened by deteriorating tiger habitat.Research highlights\xe2\x96\xba Modeling of the tiger trade indicates enforcement cannot prevent extirpation of wild tigers. \xe2\x96\xba Conservation payments protect wild tigers, except for an inability to enforce contracts. \xe2\x96\xba Legal sales of captive-bred tigers can increase wild numbers despite higher demand this causes. \xe2\x96\xba A monopoly on legal sales protects wild tigers if a ban on non-farmed products is also enforced. \xe2\x96\xba Protection of habitat and tiger prey prevents further demise of wild tiger populations.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIn investigating criminal cases of poaching and smuggling involving tigers (Panthera tigris), the number of tiger individuals involved is critical for determining the penalty. Morphological methodologies do not often work because tiger parts do not possess the distinctive characteristics of the individual. Microsatellite DNAs have been proved a reliable marker for the individualization of animals. Seven microsatellite loci derived from domestic cat (Felis catus) were selected to individualize tigers, namely F41, F42, F146, Fca304, Fca391, Fca441 and Fca453. A reference population containing 37 unrelated tigers were used to investigate alleles, allelic frequencies, genotypes and genotype frequencies of each locus. Consequently, the data was used to assess the validity of the combination of seven loci for tiger individualization. All loci were polymorphic and easy to amplify. Three out of the seven loci were significantly departure from the Hardy\xe2\x80\x93Weinberg Equilibrium (P < 0.05). Cumulative discrimination power (DP) calculated with observed genotype frequencies was 0.99999789. Match probability of an individual in the reference population with a random individual in seven loci ranged from 7.34 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x929 to 2.77 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x925. This suggests that combining the seven microsatellite loci provides desirable power to individualize tigers. The combination of seven loci was applied to a case of tiger bone smuggling. Genotypes of all samples were identical in all seven loci, and the PM of the evidence samples in the seven loci hit 5.63 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x927, provided evidence that the bones belong to a single tiger.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Forest fragmentation has been used as a proxy for quality of habitats.\xe2\x80\xa2The focus was on mammals of Nepal: tiger, common leopard, rhinoceros and elephant.\xe2\x80\xa2Fragmented forests are likely to have more human\xe2\x80\x93wildlife conflict.\xe2\x80\xa2Results provide useful information for long-term conservation of endangered wildlife.AbstractFragmented forests and heterogeneous landscapes are likely to have less natural vegetation and smaller core areas, a low degree of landscape connectivity, high prevalence of anthropogenic edges, and high landscape heterogeneity, which may alter\xe2\x80\x94at varying degrees\xe2\x80\x94behavior of wildlife species such as attacks on humans. We evaluated whether or not forest fragmentation (e.g. shape, size and distribution of forest patches measured as landscape shape index, effective mesh size, and landscape heterogeneity), habitats (proportion of bush and grassland, distance to water sources), and human disturbances (human population density) have a significant relationship with frequencies of human deaths and injuries by Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), common leopard (Panthera pardus), one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) and Asiatic elephant (Elephas maximus). Data on human injury and death were obtained from a national survey over five years (2010\xe2\x80\x932014). The relationship between wildlife attacks and landscape attributes were investigated using a zero-inflated Poisson regression model. Attacks by tigers were significantly and positively associated with forest fragmentation (effective mesh size which is high in a landscape consisting of disconnected small patches). Attacks by common leopards were strongly positively related with landscape heterogeneity, and negatively related to the proportion of bush and grassland. Attacks by one-horned rhinoceros were positively significantly related to the distance to water sources, and proportion of bush and grassland in the landscape. Attacks by elephants were strongly and positively associated with the forest fragmentation (landscape shape index, which increases as patches in the landscapes becomes disaggregated). These results suggest that forest fragmentation is inevitably a critical driver of human\xe2\x80\x93wildlife conflicts, although the extent of effects varies depending on species specific habitat requirements.'

Abstract: 'Publisher SummaryThe rapidly changing field of molecular genetics, particularly advances in genome sequence analyses, has provided new tools to reconstruct what defines a tiger and its origins. The evolutionary history framing the tiger into the exquisite predator has ancestral roots and history are depicted in its phylogeography, the genetic patterns of diversification among individuals and populations on both temporal and geographical scales. The subspecies concept provokes both scientific and political controversy because several subspecies are considered to be specific units of conservation, which are protected by international treaties and organizations concerned with the stewardship of wildlife on the species level. The recognition of subspecies has particular relevance because tiger conservation strategies are inextricably tied to subspecific taxonomic divisions.

The most direct way to address the dilemma is through a thorough understanding of the genetic ancestry, the extent of genetic admixture, and the level of genetic diversity of captive tigers in relation to the wild populations.'

Abstract: "Publisher SummaryUnderstanding tiger genetics is important, but in field conservation the aim is to save all wild tigers, regardless of specific species. Revelations of the enormity of the illegal wildlife trade and the worsening situation drew scientists closer together. Poaching and loss of habitat and prey remain major threats to the tiger. IUCN declared that to maintain a genetic pool of sufficient variety in a population of animals like the tiger, it is essential that a contiguous population totaling at least 300 head exists. Tiger populations are fragmented into dangerously low numbers, except in the Russian Far East, the Indo-Bangladesh Sundarbans, and one or two Indian reserves. There are serious political threats to the tiger's future in India. Parliament has weakened the Wildlife Protection and Forest Conservation Acts, which have been the principal legal protectors of the tiger. Representatives of most of the tiger countries have worked together to devise what Seidensticker declared was \xe2\x80\x9ca common understanding of what is required for securing a future for wild tigers through a more purposive and sustainable approach.\xe2\x80\x9d"

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Activity budgets of seven captive tigers were analysed to assess their welfare.\xe2\x80\xa2Tigers in Piedmontese zoos experienced a basic welfare status.\xe2\x80\xa2A water pool with clean water could enhance tiger welfare status.\xe2\x80\xa2Enclosure size was not correlated with tiger welfare.AbstractThe activity budgets of seven captive tigers (Panthera tigris) housed in four zoological gardens (A, B, C, D) were analysed to assess their welfare and to relate it to several variables, including enclosure type, management, and animal history. Behaviours were recorded by instantaneous focal animal sampling at 2-min intervals. Data were collected by five observers using an ethogram listing 26 behaviours adapted from the literature. To process the data, the activity budgets of each tiger and the overall activity budget were constructed. On the basis of previous literature, some of the behaviours, listed in the ethogram, were labelled as indicators of diminished welfare and some were labelled as indicators of enhanced welfare. Statistical analysis was carried out to determine in which zoo the tigers were more prone to exhibit indicators of enhanced welfare and which feature(s) had a major effect on their welfare. Over 195\xc2\xa0h of data were collected and 5867 observations were recorded. The tigers in zoo A (OR\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa04.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.2\xe2\x80\x935.3) and zoo C (OR\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01.83, 95% CI 1.4\xe2\x80\x932.4) were more prone to express indicators of enhanced welfare with respect to zoo D as the reference. Among the variables describing animal peculiarity, daily routine management, and enclosure features, the presence of a water pool with clean water was significantly associated with enhanced welfare (OR\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa02.04, 95% CI 1.4\xe2\x80\x933.04). The data suggested that none of the tigers displayed consistent signs of stress and that all experienced a basic welfare status. An essential feature that helped to enhance good animal welfare was a water pool in the enclosure containing clean water.'

Abstract: 'Publisher SummaryThe tiger (Panthera tigris) originated in the landscape that is now China, and was widely distributed over Southeast Asia even about two million years ago. Although no historical data exist on tiger population sizes, old hunting records provide valuable insights into their abundance in the past. To save the tiger in remaining habitats, priority landscapes need to be identified where conservation efforts can be focused to secure breeding habitats connected by functional corridors. Poaching, both of prey and tigers, needs to be controlled. Programs to reduce the dependence of people on the surrounding wildlife habitats need to be promoted, and feral dogs that might kill wild ungulates and deter tigers need to be eliminated. There is increasing analytical sophistication and greater reliability in approaches to prioritize landscapes for global tiger conservation. The development of a synthetic toolbox of conservation approaches that draw on the social, economic, political, and institutional complexities of on-ground tiger conservation across various regions is an essential baseline for tiger conservation that is currently missing.'

Abstract: 'Publisher SummaryThe tiger has always had a considerable impact on human cultures, especially where people and tigers have lived together and still do co-exist. It is certainly one of the most easily recognizable cats, with its distinctive and unique striped coat and is also commonly believed to be the biggest cat species alive today, although this claim is questionable. The tiger shows considerable variation in its size, coloration and markings, reflecting the variety of habitats it occupies throughout its wide geographical distribution from the temperate oak forests of the north to the humid tropical forests on the Equator. Understanding this variation is a key to its successful current and future conservation, but people are still uncertain of its significance. Its large size and consequent need for large prey have brought it into conflict with people by preying on them and their livestock, but it has also earned our respect and admiration for its power and prowess as a killer. Research on geographical variation in tigers is suggesting two possible models, which have enormous significance for future tiger conservation. The more conservative model, based both on molecular and morphological research, suggests that eight or more subspecies, some of which may even be distinct phylogenetic species, should be recognized.'

Abstract: "Publisher SummaryThreats to today's fragmented wild tiger populations include not only the obvious but also the added extinction risks associated with small populations\xe2\x80\x94increased vulnerability to demographic stochasticity, environmental variation, catastrophic events such as disease or fire, and genetic issues such as loss of variation and inbreeding depression. The smaller the population, the greater potential influence these stochastic events are likely to have on population persistence. Tiger populations in captivity are also small and therefore are vulnerable to these same risks. Population management gives zoo biologists the ability to improve the viability of captive populations through well-planned demographic and genetic management. Population biologists can use this rich database to analyze the current status of populations, examine past trends, and project what the future might hold given different management strategies. Demographic and genetic analyses guide a committee of zoo tiger managers and experts in assessing the long-term viability of the population, setting realistic population goals, and making breeding and transfer recommendations to work toward these goals. Tiger management must also consider all the other factors such as costs and risks of moving tigers to form good genetic breeding pairs; factors affecting the likelihood of success, such as age, behavior, health, and prior reproduction; and the requests of participating zoos."

Author: 'Ji H.'

Abstract: 'AbstractPatterns of geographical variation in tigers are reviewed extensively by a morphometric analysis based on 273 skulls of certain wild origin. The following principal observations emerging from this investigation are found:1.Modern tigers contain two basic forms: the mainland Asia tiger and the Sunda Island tiger. They are differentiated markedly in skull morphology as well as other morphological characters, the characteristic skull shape and small body size in Java/Bali tigers can be interpreted as adaptational responses to a particular island landscape type and prey species fauna, an evolutionary process known as insular dwarfism.2.The Sumatran tiger (P.t. sumatrae) probably represents a hybrid of mainland and Island tigers, which originated from mainland Southeast Asia, colonized Indonesia and hybridized with the Sunda island tigers (Java tiger) during the late Pleistocene, and was subsequently completely isolated from both the mainland Southeast Asia and Java/Bali populations.3.Among the mainland Asia tigers, the Amur or Siberian tiger is the most distinct; India, Indochinese and South China tigers are craniometrically distinguishable on average, but with clear overlaps; the Caspian tiger, on the other hand, is indistinguishable from other mainland forms and extensively overlaps with both the Northern and Southern Asia subspecies.4.Most proportional craniometric differences among tigers observed from this study are mainly allometric; the pattern of craniometric variation in mainland tigers is clearly clinal; craniometric variation and sexual dimorphism are closely related.5.Skull morphometric characters are quite effective for discriminating major tiger geographical populations, but further analysis using other phenetic craniodental characters (shape of sagittal crest, degree of convexity of the frontal, endocranial volume, detailed carnassial morphology) as well as molecular genetic sources, rather than this purely metric study, would certainly be of considerable value in understanding the evolutionary relationships among mainland Asia tigers and their appropriate taxonomic designations.'

Author: 'Emily T.'

Abstract: "AbstractIn the spring of 2006, Tibetans in China set fire to more than a million dollars worth of otter, leopard and tiger pelts. The numerous bonfires were a response to the 14th Dalai Lama's statement, made at the Kalachakra Initiation Ceremony in India, that Tibetans should cease wearing such pelts. The Chinese state interpreted this as an act of loyalty to the Dalai Lama and this evidence of multiple overlapping sovereignties as a threat to its exclusive territorial sovereignty. An effort to clarify this space invited a sovereign invocation of the exception, as salaried employees were forced to wear endangered animal pelts, violating Chinese national law. A conjunctural analysis of the Dalai Lama's speech and the subsequent burnings demonstrates that contrary to prevailing narratives, transnational environmental advocacy played a key role. The conjuncture in which these events took place was shaped by multiple competing entanglements of Chinese, Indian, and Tibetan sovereignties with nature protection and transnational activism. Two distinct assemblages, shaped by power relations and the politics of sovereignty, formed around protecting the tiger across the Himalayas, with dramatically different effects. The case shows that far from post-sovereign environmental governance, nature and sovereignty remain inextricably entangled, and illustrates how multiple modes to construct and defend state sovereignty come into conflict with each other.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Sovereignty-transnational environmentalism entanglements produced the pelt burnings. \xe2\x96\xba Efforts to maintain absolute state territorial sovereignty produce contradictions. \xe2\x96\xba Environmental movement motivations and identities emerge contingently. \xe2\x96\xba Predicaments of state sovereignty have multiplied with transnational activism."

Abstract: "AbstractApplication of remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) as a tool has assumed an immense significance in habitat suitability modelling for various wildlife species and now a days these are widely used in conservation biology and wildlife management.This paper evaluates habitat suitability for tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) in Chandoli National Park, India. This research provides information about potential areas that can be declared as Tiger Reserve, a federal designation of protection. Habitat evaluation was completed in the Chandoli National Park (17\xc2\xb0 04\xe2\x80\xb2 00\xe2\x80\xb3 N to 17\xc2\xb0 19\xe2\x80\xb2 54\xe2\x80\xb3 N and 73\xc2\xb0 40\xe2\x80\xb2 43\xe2\x80\xb3 E to 73\xc2\xb0 53\xe2\x80\xb2 09\xe2\x80\xb3 E) using habitat suitability index (HSI). Remotely sensed data of satellite IRS-P6, LISS-III of 25th February 2005 was procured from National Remote Sensing Agency, India. The satellite imagery data was digitally processed and collateral data were generated from topographic maps in a GIS framework. Various layers of different variables such as landuse land cover, forest density, measures of proximity to disturbances and water resources and a digital terrain model were created based on ground truthing. These layers, GPS location of animal's presence and \xe2\x80\x9cbinomial multiple logistic regression (BMLR)\xe2\x80\x9d techniques were integrated in a GIS environment for the HSI modelling.Results indicate that approximately 160.48\xc2\xa0km2 (55%) of the forest of Chandoli National Park is highly suitable for herbivores population, and 176.52\xc2\xa0km2 (50%) of the Park is suitable for tigers. Therefore, this study concludes that forest areas within the Chandoli National Park are appropriate for consideration as Tiger Reserve.Furthermore, the identification and mapping of wildlife corridors and other forest patches lying in between neighboring protected area like Koyana sanctuary, suggests that these region of Sahyadri range of Western Ghats should be included into the proposed Tiger Reserve. This will be a benefit for tigers, as tigers require larger and least disturbed forest habitats for establishing and maintaining their high-density population. Fortunately, in May 2008 the Government of India declared Chandoli NP as tiger reserve. Thus declaration of Chandoli National Park as a Tiger Reserve reflects that the habitat suitability model developed by us for tiger was not only statistically sound but also has potential to be considered while taking any decision regarding wildlife habitat management."

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Effects of human disturbance on the prey of tigers were studied in the Chitwan NP.\xe2\x80\xa2The distribution of the prey of tigers is strongly affected by human disturbance.\xe2\x80\xa2Despite conservation measures the core area of the Chitwan NP is disturbed.\xe2\x80\xa2Human disturbance will be reduced by conserving forests in the buffer zone.AbstractChitwan National Park is surrounded by large settlements of people who exploit the areas where tigers and their prey occur. In this study, we measured the associations between the abundance of the prey of tiger with habitat, topographic, predator and human disturbance variables, using canonical correspondence analysis. We show that the abundance of hog deer is closely associated with areas of tall grassland and floodplains, while that of other ungulate species is associated with that of forests and short grasslands. Primates were mainly abundant in riverine and mixed forests. Abundances of most species, except hog deer and wild pig, were more closely associated with areas of forests than with open areas, because the latter were mainly occupied by humans and livestock. The presence of the species studied was closely associated with habitat and disturbance variables. Proximity of water holes was more closely associated with the presence of ungulates than primates. There were close associations between human disturbance and abundances of primates and muntjac, possibly because these species are more tolerant and adapted to human disturbance. However, the major prey species of tiger were negatively associated with human disturbance. As a consequence, human disturbance has resulted in a decline in the abundance of tigers and the lack of prey could result in their extinction in the Chitwan NP. Therefore, in terms of the conservation and management of the park, minimizing human disturbance of wildlife habitats and restoration of a buffer zone forest should be the prime objectives.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Recent studies focused on distribution survey, habitat ecology, threat assessment and conservation outreach in In-situ.\xe2\x80\xa2Bamboo, shrub, canopy, fallen logs, steeper slope, and closer to water sources are important variables in the habitat.\xe2\x80\xa2Molecular study suggested high genetic diversity and wide historical gene flow among the red panda population in China.\xe2\x80\xa2Habitat fragmentation, poaching and illegal trade, and developmental activities are the major threats to the red panda.\xe2\x80\xa2There is need of extensive studies in movement, microbiota, isotopes, pathogens, and threats minimizing mechanisms.AbstractThe red panda (Ailurus fulgens), a vegetarian member of the order Carnivora, is distributed in Nepal, India, Bhutan, Myanmar, and China. Many populations occur at low densities in small fragmented forest patches and face pressure from habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation, poaching, and developmental activities. Most studies have taken place in China and Nepal; few studies have been conducted in the other countries, creating a gap in documentation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase our knowledge regarding the ecology of the red panda and its threats. Based on literature regarding the red panda, we attempt to summarize the progress in research on its current distribution, ecology, and existing threats in the wild, highlight conservation approaches and recommend future directions. Recent studies have focused on wild populations; however, earlier studies emphasized captive. China and Nepal have a wider elevational range in red panda distribution (2000\xe2\x80\x933800\xe2\x80\xafm) compared to other countries. Bamboo mixed subtropical and temperate forest and other associated variables, including a relatively high cover of bamboo, shrubs, and canopy, high densities of fallen logs, relatively steep slopes, and proximity to water sources, are ecologically important in the habitat. Due to differences in methodologies, prior estimates on population size and habitat area have varied. The genetic diversity of red pandas is high in China, but a lack of such data in other range countries makes subspecies classification unclear. Movement, microbiota, pathogens, and threats have been insufficiently documented; thus, we recommended extensive research in these areas. Furthermore, regional cooperation in research, data sharing, and policy implementation are urgently needed to protect wild panda populations.'

Abstract: 'AbstractVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known to influence the testis function. To establish the role of VEGF in the testis of a variety of species, we analyzed the expression of VEGF transcript using human gene-specific primers by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in the testes of 18 vertebrates, including a few endangered species. An amplicon of 566 bp representing VEGF165 was identified in testis of all species in this study. Sequence analysis of these amplicons revealed 84 to 96% homology to available human VEGF sequence and to the VEGF sequences of other species in GenBank. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed expression of VEGF protein, primarily in Sertoli and Leydig cells and occasionally in the germ cells of the testis sections. It can be concluded from this study that expression of VEGF transcript is conserved in the testis of several vertebrates and may have a role in the process of spermatogenesis.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis study analyses the factors responsible for effective management and conservation of forest resources in Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR) in India. Both primary and secondary data have been used for analyzing the determinants of forest conservation outcome in 35 sample villages located in and around STR. The result shows that forest growth is positively associated with function of local management institutions, caste homogeneity, and distance to forest department and nearest market. Moreover, it is concluded that efforts at improving forest conservation outcomes should not be confined to the poorest communities, as rich communities are largely responsible for adopting degrading resource use practices. Our result recommends the revival of existing local institutions and promotion of more participatory community management approaches in the STR. Further, in order to reduce trust deficit that exist between fringe villages and the forest department, more usufruct and ownership rights over resource should be transferred to local people, which in turn may enhance better forest conservation outcome.'

Descriptive statistics and econometric techniques such as probit, tobit, and Heckman two-step selection models were used to analyze the data. The study finds that households derive a significant portion of their income from the collection of NTFPs; however, the extent and pattern of household dependence on NTFPs for income differ widely across different socioeconomic and demographic profiles. Level of education, age, landholding and household size, number of children, and gender influence the intensity of household collection of NTFPs. Households located inside the core zone of the reserve tend to depend more on NTFP collection compared to households residing in the buffer zone. Provision of non-farm employment and adequate farm land will go a long way in reducing household dependence on NTFPs and thereby improve forest conservation outcomes."

Abstract: 'AbstractBangladesh has vast coastal and marine resources along its south edge. Due to the geographical position and climatic condition, the coastal area of the country is known as one of the highly productive areas of the world. Bangladesh is rich not only in terms of its vast water areas but also in terms of the biological diversity. One of the unique features of the coastal areas is the influence of the mangrove forests, which support a high number of fishes and other commercially important aquatic organisms. The biological and ecological values of the Bay of Bengal have been pointed out by many authors. The coastal and marine fisheries have been playing considerable roles not only in the social and economic development of the country but also in the regional ecological balance. A large number of commercially important fishes have long been exploited which are of high export values. Shrimp aquaculture has become a highly traded export-oriented industry for the last few decades. In spite of having bright prospects, marine aquaculture on a commercial basis as well as marine stock enhancement and sea ranching are yet to be developed. The marine fisheries sector has been suffering from chronic disintegration and mismanagement that have led to many consequences. Most of the commercially important fish stocks are either overexploited or under threat. Marine pollution has reached a level that could create an unmanageable situation in the near future; coastal shrimp farming has generated considerable debates due to its adverse environmental and socioeconomic impacts. The Bay of Bengal and its coastal areas are one of the most poorly studied areas of the world although it possesses high potential for further stock improvement. Proper attention is needed in every aspect of exploitation, handling and processing, export and marketing as well as in biological and institutional management strategies. The Bay of Bengal has been increasingly important for local development as well as for a global perspective. The coastal and marine fisheries of the Bay of Bengal are briefly reviewed in this paper to provide a salient feature of the available information and resource base and to identify future research and management needs.'

This recognition is a result of the progress made during the last decade in which the feasibility of oocyte recovery from gonadotropin-treated females, in vitro fertilization, embryo cryopreservation and embryo transfer (ET) was demonstrated in the domestic cat (Felis catus). Additionally, embryos have been produced in vitro from oocytes matured in vitro after recovery from ex situ ovaries of both domestic and non-domestic cat species and domestic kittens have been born following transfer of these embryos. In vitro fertilization has been successful in at least one-third of wild cat species and kittens were born after transfer of Indian desert cat (Felis sylvestris ornata) embryos into a domestic cat and con-specific transfer of tiger (Panthera tigris) embryos. The domestic cat is not only a valuable model for development of in vitro techniques but may serve as a recipient of embryos from several species of small wild cats.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe Tiger (Panthera (Felis) tigris) has suffered a catastrophic decline in numbers in all countries within its range, so that, today, there are probably no more than 5,000 animals of the eight races remaining in the wild. Although, in certain countries, the Tiger is given protection, in others it is still under heavy persecution. Surviving populations are now too scattered to maintain a viable genetic interchange. The chief cause of the decline has been the massive destruction of forests in Asia, but unrestricted hunting and poisoning and the demand for skins by the fur trade have also been important factors. Strenuous international efforts are now being made to create fourteen special reserves in order to save the Indian Tiger race, of which about 2,350 individuals remain.'

Abstract: 'AbstractEthnopharmacological relevanceBoswellia serrata Roxb. ex Colebr. is a multiple-use tree species used for fodder, timber and is tapped for an oleo-resin known internationally as Indian frankincense or Indian olibanum. The main commercial uses of B. serrata oleo-resin are medicinal, religious, and in cosmetics and perfumery. B. serrata, like other frankincense species, is an important source of boswellic acid used in the pharmaceutical industry. India is the only producer of B. serrata oleo-resin, mainly from the states of Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Jharkhand. Market demands, harvesting and managing practices have pressured Indian frankincense populations into imminent decline and start to affect populations of African frankincense as buyers turn to look for substitutions.Aims of the reviewWe have assessed the ecological status of Indian frankincense based on the assumption that current species management practices are not sustainable. This review summarizes the outcomes of this assessment in terms of habitat and population trends, harvesting/collection practices and uses, current threats and management measures.Materials and methodsFirstly, we reviewed published information on B. serrata population biology and studies on impacts of wild harvest from across the geographic range of this species. Secondly, global trade data for B. serrata were analysed. Thirdly, we reviewed published information on B. serrata management measures and cultivation practices.ResultsThe five largest importers of frankincense from India in 2016\xe2\x80\x932017 were Trinidad & Tobago, Germany, Guatemala, Mexico and the USA, in order of volume. Total volumes exported were 102.8 metric tonnes in 2015\xe2\x80\x932016 and 74.56 metric tonnes in 2016\xe2\x80\x932017. Collection data are less readily available. What could be found, however, points toward market demand for Indian frankincense and its derivatives by far exceeding what can reasonably be harvested/collected without endangering populations of this species, opening the door to adulteration and substitution.ConclusionsIn conclusion, not only sustainable harvesting and management practices, but also establishing sustainable supply chains are needed to protect this species from overexploitation and thus endangerment.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (431KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractObjectiveTo determine the effectiveness of yohimbine as an antagonist of ketamine-xylazine anaesthesia in captive Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica), tigers (Panthera tigris) and leopards (Panthera pardus).Study designProspective clinical trial.AnimalsFifty-two healthy adult lions, 55 adult leopards and 16 adult male tigers.MethodsCaptive wild felids in Indian zoos were anaesthetized with a combination of ketamine (2.2-2.6 mg kg\xe2\x88\x921) and xylazine (1.1-1.3 mg kg\xe2\x88\x921) using a dart propelled from a blowpipe. Time to onset of anaesthesia, lateral recumbency and induction time were measured, and physiological variables (respiration, heart rate and rectal temperature) were recorded once after the onset of complete anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was antagonized at various time periods with an intravenous administration of either 0.1 or 0.15 mg kg\xe2\x88\x921 yohimbine. Onset of arousal and time to complete anaesthetic recovery were recorded.ResultsA total of 123 immobilizations were conducted between 2000 and 2005. Anaesthetic induction was achieved in 15-25 minutes in all animals. Incidents of sudden recovery or life-threatening effects associated with immobilizations were not observed. Yohimbine effectively antagonized anaesthesia in all animals within 10 minutes without any excitatory behaviour compared to control animals. No adverse reactions/side effects to yohimbine were recorded except that a few leopards exhibited seizure-like signs for a short period immediately after yohimbine administration. The duration of anaesthesia had no significant effect on the recovery time in any of the animals.Conclusion and clinical relevanceYohimbine antagonized the xylazine portion of ketamine-xylazine anaesthesia and thereby hastened recovery from anaesthesia in Asiatic lions, tigers and leopards.'

India's Project Tiger is the admiration of the world. Its slowly growing list of reserves seems exhilarating proof that a caring government could step in and save an important, charismatic species, and countless others living in its shadow, from the very brink of extinction. Careful monitoring of tiger populations across India for two years by the Wildlife Institute of India confirms that human encroachment and habitat destruction have caused a 60% drop in tiger numbers. When tiger conservationists serving on government wildlife boards raise their concerns, the standard response continues to be to replace them with more \xe2\x80\x9ccooperative\xe2\x80\x9d individuals."

Abstract: 'AbstractThe Sundarbans is an active biogenic coast entitled to world heritage site. The most notable feature of this Sundarbans is that it is located in a sea-influenced region but depends on nutrient-enriched freshwater flow from the upstream rivers. With its intrinsic transboundary ecological functions, the Sundarbans also provides buffer for lives and livelihood opportunity for millions of people living in its immediate vicinity. Woodcutter, honey collector, fisher, fuel wood collector, and snail and oyster collector are the major livelihood groups directly depending on Sundarbans. Society\xe2\x80\x93ecosystem interrelationship and dependence on hydromorphologic system make this deltaic mangrove a unique socioecological system and also very vulnerable to climate change-induced salinity intrusion. Mangrove ecosystem health with its productivity is deteriorating due to climate change-induced rising salinity in major rivers of the Sundarbans. This change in ecological productivity ultimately affects the forest-dependent livelihoods. This chapter presents an analysis of evolving nature of salinity intrusion hazard developing in the mangrove socioecological system. The evolving nature of salinity intrusion was analyzed through developing Event-Consequence Chain for each of the five livelihood capitals (Natural, Financial, Physical, Human, and Social) of a Sundarbans-dependent livelihood group. Besides, the control options were identified with the aim of unplugging the pathways between two successive events (or sequential consequences) or of lingering the evolving nature. The overall study was carried out through participatory approach using Shared Learning Dialogue method to ensure engagement of the local community. This research discusses the sequential events evolving with salinity intrusion from hydrologic system to its reach\xe2\x80\x94the livelihood system. At the end, it presents an indicative adaptive strategy developed based on identified control stages of the hazard chains for climate change resilient governance of the mangrove socioecological system that clearly calls for delta-based approach of management.'

Author: 'Dipankar'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437778137000203
Abstract: 'Publisher SummaryThis chapter explores the distribution of red panda Ailurus fulgens fulgens in India. Present knowledge of red panda distribution from its entire range in India is sparse. It is suggested that total habitat probably used by red panda in India is 12500 km2, with a state-wise break-up of 11300 km2 in Arunachal Pradesh, 300km2 in Meghalaya, 800km2 in Sikkim, and 100 km2 in Darjeeling district of West Bengal. Extinction risk in the mammalian order Carnivora, of which red panda is a member, is predicted more strongly by biology than exposure to high-density human populations, however, that does not leave red pandas less susceptible to threats. Loss of corridors and small island populations of red panda mean it is going to face problems of inbreeding in the near future. Chettri et al. found that the corridors between the different PAs in Kanchenjunga Landscape spread in Nepal, and areas of Darjeeling and Sikkim in India, which are necessary for maintaining connectivity within wider existing habitats for flag ship species such as tiger, elephant and red panda, are practically non-existent. Therefore, conservation of large continuous tracts of temperate forests is the key to tackle this threat. WWF India has been working for conservation of biodiversity with special reference to threatened wildlife in the Kanchendzonga Landscape, covering the northern part of West Bengal and Sikkim.'

Title: 'Conservation of biodiversity of the coastal resources of Sundarbans, Northeast India: an integrated approach through environmental education'
Author: 'Santosh Kumar'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe Indian Sundarbans, a diversified coastal wetland on the southern fringe of the State of West Bengal, harbors a luxuriant biodiversity and acts as a potential refuge of living marine resources. Girdled with thick mangrove foliage, this estuarine delta system offers an excellent nursery ground for most of the brackishwater finfish and shellfish. Since supply of hatchery-produced tiger prawn seed (Penaeus monodon) is highly inadequate in West Bengal, the aquaculture farms of this region largely depend on the supply from natural resources. Being motivated by a regular cash income, the majority of coastal people from Sundarbans have adopted prawn seed collection as their profession almost throughout the year as an important source of earning. The users are neither trained nor guided at any stage from collection to marketing and are fully dependent on traditional methods. They first sort out the tiger prawn seeds (mainly the postlarval stage PL 20) accounting only 0.25\xe2\x80\x930.27% of the total catch and thereafter the major portion of the haul are thrown away on the beach flats or the tidal mudflats. This wasted by-catch contains the juveniles of economic and uneconomic varieties of finfish and shellfish along with a bulk of holoplankters and meroplankters (non-target species). This practice causes several ecological and occupational consequences, namely, (i) the huge destruction of the pelagic biota that can lead to severe stock depletion as well as hamper the energy transference through the marine ecosystem food webs; (ii) constant dragging of nets along the coast and tidal creeks paves the way for soil erosion, uprooting the mangrove seedlings and saltmarsh vegetation; (iii) the water quality is deteriorating in the catchment areas due to mud erosion and (iv) due to constant contact with the seawater, the collectors are affected with waterborne diseases, skin infections, reproductive tract disease in women and many other contagious diseases.This paper, in addition to identifying the challenge to environmental quality and resource abundance, emphasizes the need for grass-root public education so that local people come to understand, support and implement sustainable resource conservation and environmental protection activities now and in the future. As a follow-up course of action, the authors have initiated a general awareness program for developing consciousness among the coastal people regarding proper use of natural resources. Initiatives are taken for educating coastal people by holding workshops and seminars with the use of educational resource materials. Exclusive awareness camps and grass root level training for coastal people are also being proposed as a future course of action by means of exhibitions, audiovisuals etc. It is proposed that local government bodies come forward to mitigate this problem with scientific and rational approaches and to take proper actions towards conservation.'

Title: 'ReviewTrypanosomosis of wild animals with emphasis on Indian scenario'
Author: 'Vikrant'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405939017300151
Abstract: 'AbstractTrypanosomosis is a significant disease affecting wild animals throughout the globe. The literature pertaining to wild life trypanosomosis in India is very much scanty. Therefore, an effort was made to compile all the available literatureabout prevalence of trypanosomosis in wild animals, its clinico-pathology, diagnosis, treatment and control from Indian perspective. Reports suggest that the clinical disease and outbreaks in Indian wildlife occurs more commonly among captive than the free-living wild animals. Though the clinical symptoms showed by affected animals are same as described everywhere, however carnivorism of affected meat was found to be the striking feature in many feline and canine wild life outbreaks from India. Draught, starvation and concurrent diseases often compromise the trypano-tolerant status leading to flared up trypanosomosis in free-living wild animals. The cumulative effect of any of these factors produces severe physiological and somatic stress which in turn leads to immunosupression. Stress is the underlying cause that compromises the trypanotolerance in wild animals.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe carnivore family Felidae is composed of 38 species of cats, including domestic cats, which naturally range over five continents. As stunningly efficient and majestic carnivores, cats specialize in agility, stealth, and speed during their predation and are the keynote species in their ecosystems. From the largest subspecies of tiger to the smallest breed of domestic cat, the Singapura, cats are easily recognized by their form, function, and genetics. Domestic cats originated from their Felis lineage wildcat progenitors in the Near and Middle East as humans became agricultural species. In tandem with human migrations, domestic cats have traveled around the world, generally to work as vermin control on boats and farms; thus, their population management has generally been unrestricted. Although all nondomestic species of cats are listed as endangered or threatened by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) and CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), because domestic cats, as non-native species, severely threaten native wildlife species, their management is a matter of significant debate, even though the resulting feral populations are due to human negligence. According to pet owner surveys, approximately 38 million households (~34%) in the United States own a cat, accounting for approximately 88.3 million cats. Feline genetics is being employed to conserve the wild populations of cats, manage the feral populations of domestic cats, and improve the health of the beloved random-bred and fancy cat breeds. Advances in feline genetic resources are assisting all populations of cats, both wild and domestic. Studies and improvements of cat health have diverse and direct effects on human health and well-being, including helping to understand the mechanisms of disease as well as providing benefits in nursing and hospice care.'

Title: 'Compensation payments, procedures and policies towards human-wildlife conflict management: Insights from India'
Author: 'Krithi K.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320717318852
Abstract: "AbstractThe effectiveness of compensation payments in mitigating and resolving human-wildlife conflict is globally debated. We examined procedures, types, and payments made for incidents reported in India from 2010 to 2015. Among India's 29 states, 22 (76%) compensated for crop loss, 18 (62%) for property damage, 26 (90%) for livestock depredation, and 28 (97%) for human injury or death. In 2012\xe2\x80\x932013, a total of 78,656 conflict incidents were reported from 18 states with complete data. Of these incidents, 73.4% were crop loss and property damage, 20% livestock predation, 6.2% human injury, and 0.4% human death. In 2012\xe2\x80\x932013, payments totalled $5,332,762 (ranging from $0 for no reported incidents in Tripura to $1,956,115 for 36,091 incidents in Karnataka). The average expenditures per incident were $47 for crop and property damage, $74 for livestock, $103 for human injury and $3224 for human death. These numbers underestimate the total extent of conflict because of low reporting rates and unavailability of complete records from all states. We found a lack of policies in some states, while others have low payment amounts along with high transaction costs. Despite a significant Indian government mandate supporting compensation payments in India, there exist inconsistencies in eligibility, application, assessment, implementation, and payment procedures across states. Ensuring that compensation reaches all affected people requires standardizing these processes in a transparent and efficient manner, while also monitoring its perceived benefits to wildlife conservation."

Abstract: 'AbstractMangroves are rich in faunal diversity, both terrestrial and aquatic. Indian mangroves accommodate 3091 faunal species, including globally threatened ones. Mangrove fauna are at elevated risk because of human pressure and a growing threat from the effects of climate change, especially sea level rise. Estuaries, macro-tidal and sediment-rich coasts and dense mangrove forest areas, which are rich in fauna, deserve much conservation. It is necessary to have site-specific information on faunal diversity and resources, more species recovery programmes, and to establish integrated management planning with the participation of local human communities for better management of faunal resources.'

Abstract: 'AbstractEstablishment of fibroblast cell lines of endangered pig breeds and research on the gene functions based on the cells made a significant contribution to the conservation and utilization of genetic resources. The Wuzhishan miniature pig ear marginal tissue fibroblast cell line (WPF22) from 22 samples, stocking 87 cryogenically-preserved vials, was successfully established by using primary explants technique and cell cryopreservation techniques. WPF22 cells were adherent, with a population doubling time of 30.2\xc2\xa0h. Chromosome karyotyping and G-banding analysis showed that >90.2% of cells were diploid (2n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa038) prior to the 4th generation. Neither microbial contamination nor cross-contamination was detected by isoenzyme analyses. Cell viability was 97.8% before cryopreservation and 94.9% after recovery. To determine cell permeability, intracellular path and stability of exogenous proteins during the transduction, six fluorescent protein genes were transferred into fibroblasts by lipofectamine-mediated method. The transfection efficiency of six fluorescent protein genes fluctuated between 8.1% and 42.6%. ECFP and DsRed were mostly shown in cytoplasmic in dots around the nucleus, and EYFP and EGFP had a slightly stronger expression in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm, but without expression in some vacuoles. Every index of the WPF22 cell line meets all the standard quality controls of American type Culture Collection (ATCC). This research thus does not only preserve important genetic resources of Wuzhishan miniature pig at the cell level, but also serve as a valuable resource for genome, postgenome and somacloning research.'

Abstract: 'SummaryHumpback dolphins (genus Sousa) are medium-sized delphinids found in shallow (<30\xc2\xa0m), coastal waters of the eastern Atlantic, Indian, and western Pacific Oceans. The genus is comprised of four species: (1) Atlantic humpback (Sousa teuszii), (2) Indian Ocean humpback (S. plumbea), (3) Indo-Pacific humpback (S. chinensis), and (4) Australian humpback (S. sahulensis) dolphins. Information on the ecology, behavior and life history of all humpback dolphins remains scarce. Most study populations to date indicate that all species occur in small numbers, with most populations confirmed or suspected to be declining and threatened. Major threats affecting all species include habitat degradation and loss, and entanglement in fishing gear. Research efforts and conservation actions tailored to each species are needed to assess anthropogenic impacts, and develop strategies to eliminate or mitigate threats.'

Title: 'Supermatrix and species tree methods resolve phylogenetic relationships within the big cats, Panthera (Carnivora: Felidae)'
Author: 'Brian W.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe pantherine lineage of cats diverged from the remainder of modern Felidae less than 11 million years ago and consists of the five big cats of the genus Panthera, the lion, tiger, jaguar, leopard, and snow leopard, as well as the closely related clouded leopard. A significant problem exists with respect to the precise phylogeny of these highly threatened great cats. Despite multiple publications on the subject, no two molecular studies have reconstructed Panthera with the same topology. These evolutionary relationships remain unresolved partially due to the recent and rapid radiation of pantherines in the Pliocene, individual speciation events occurring within less than 1 million years, and probable introgression between lineages following their divergence. We provide an alternative, highly supported interpretation of the evolutionary history of the pantherine lineage using novel and published DNA sequence data from the autosomes, both sex chromosomes and the mitochondrial genome. New sequences were generated for 39 single-copy regions of the felid Y chromosome, as well as four mitochondrial and four autosomal gene segments, totaling 28.7\xc2\xa0kb. Phylogenetic analysis of these new data, combined with all published data in GenBank, highlighted the prevalence of phylogenetic disparities stemming either from the amplification of a mitochondrial to nuclear translocation event (numt), or errors in species identification. Our 47.6\xc2\xa0kb combined dataset was analyzed as a supermatrix and with respect to individual partitions using maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic inference, in conjunction with Bayesian Estimation of Species Trees (BEST) which accounts for heterogeneous gene histories. Our results yield a robust consensus topology supporting the monophyly of lion and leopard, with jaguar sister to these species, as well as a sister species relationship of tiger and snow leopard. These results highlight new avenues for the study of speciation genomics and understanding the historical events surrounding the origin of the members of this lineage.'

Title: 'A novel microsatellite (STR) marker for forensic identification of big cats in India'
Author: 'Anju'

Abstract: 'AbstractIndia is the home to five of the eight majestic big cats of the world. The three major big cats namely, lion, tiger, and leopard are listed in the Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Apart from the severe loss of the habitat, these are continuously facing the danger of extinction mainly due to poaching and hunting for their body parts, which are being greatly valued by apothecaries marketing traditional Chinese medicines. With the advent of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA-based markers have emerged as major tools in the arena of wildlife forensics. Microsatellites (short tandem repeats, STRs) are markers of choice because of their polymorphic and co-dominant nature. These strictly follow the Mendelian inheritance and are highly reproducible. We have identified a new microsatellite (STR) locus Ple 46, which shows amplification in a species-specific manner (size of STR) in all the members of the family felidae studied here. This PCR-based, non-invasive method opens a new avenue to forensic identification of big cats.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe Iriomote cat (IC), Prionailurus bengalensis iriomotensis, and the Tsushima leopard cat (TLC), Prionailurus bengalensis euptilurus, are endangered subspecies of leopard cats in Japan. In addition to habitat destruction and road kills, infectious diseases may threaten their populations, and infection with arthropod-borne pathogens has been reported in both subspecies. Infestations with ectoparasites, especially ticks, have frequently been observed in ICs and TLCs. In the present study, ticks collected from captured ICs and TLCs between November 2011 and January 2012 were morphologically identified and the prevalence of the pathogens Bartonella sp., Babesia sp., Ehrlichia sp., Anaplasma sp., Hepatozoon sp., and hemoplasmas in the ticks was molecularly evaluated. The ticks Haemaphysalis longicornis, H. hystricis, and Amblyomma testudinarium were obtained from ICs, and H. megaspinosa, Ixodes tanuki, H. campanulata, and A. testudinarium were collected from TLCs. The pathogens Hepatozoon felis, Babesia sp., and Anaplasma bovis were detected in ticks obtained from ICs, while H. felis. Babesia sp., Ehrlichia sp., E. muris, \xe2\x80\x98Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum\xe2\x80\x99, and Bartonella henselae were found in ticks from TLCs.

In a time when we are increasingly arguing for women empowerment to augment the forces of social and alternative development, there is tremendous rise even in the officially claimed number of all types of crimes committed against women in general and particularly against wives in matrimonial homes. The Indian state has, however, enacted several laws during the last 60\xc2\xa0years to address issues related to gender violence in a society dominated by patriarchal values and practices. But the legal framework, although important, appears to be grossly inadequate even today. A review of two relevant laws proves that mere passing of laws has failed to guarantee any reduction in the number of violence against women and girl child. They also do not provide assurance for improvement in justice delivery system in the Indian context. Much remains to be done to ensure gender justice and equality in a patriarchal society. Discussion here is based on government statistics, newspaper reports and field data collected from different locations in West Bengal during 2005\xe2\x80\x932010.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Interactions among livelihood capitals determine the access to provisioning services (PS).\xe2\x80\xa2Human capitals had negative effect on the access to most of the PS.\xe2\x80\xa2Physical capitals increased access to the services require costlier tools.\xe2\x80\xa2Natural capitals had highly positive impact on the access of cultivable PS.\xe2\x80\xa2Financial capitals had enhanced access to independently collectable PS.\xe2\x80\xa2Social capitals had reduced access to capital intensive PS collection.AbstractThis study aims to understand the influence of livelihood capitals on access to provisioning services (PS) of the Sundarbans Mangrove Forest (SMF) including honey, crabs, mixed fish, shrimp, shrimp fry and fuelwood. The interactions among several livelihood capital components played significant roles in shaping the composite effect of respective livelihood capitals on the access to PS. The effect of human capital was significantly positive on people\xe2\x80\x99s access to fuelwood, shrimp fry and crabs consecutively; and negative on the access to honey, shrimp and mixed fish respectively. Physical capital was likely to increase access to shrimp, shrimp fry and crabs; and decrease access to fuelwood and honey. Natural capital (i.e., land area) significantly increased the access to shrimp fry and shrimp; and reduced access to honey. Financial capital played significant positive roles in access to crabs, fuelwood and honey; and negative role in accessing mixed fish respectively. Social capital was likely to enhance access to honey and fuelwood; obstructed access to crabs, shrimp fry and shrimp. Protection of any ecosystem from over exploitation and improved wellbeing of the dependent communities can be achieved by addressing the influence of the livelihood capitals through the integrated development approach.'

Title: 'The potential for gamete recovery from non-domestic canids and felids'
Author: 'Alexandre R.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378432003001945
Abstract: 'AbstractSpecies are becoming extinct at a rate 100 times the natural background rates. Considering all mammalian orders, 24% of all Carnivora species are threatened. The goal of carnivore conservation is to reverse the decline in populations and to secure remaining populations in ways that will assure enduring public support. In this context, biotechnology is a tool with tremendous potential for assisting the conservation of endangered canid and felid species. As the first step for biotechnology development is the gamete obtainment, this review will discuss the potential of gamete recovery from non-domestic canids and felids, based on learning how to apply these procedures in the domestic carnivores. Thus, electroejaculation and obtaining both epidydimal spermatozoon and spermatogonial germ cells are indicated as techniques for male gametes recovery. In the female gametes retrieval, different methods for oocyte recovery from both antral and preantral follicles, and the possibility for ovarian tissue transplantation are discussed. Furthermore, the study discusses the responsibilities involved in the use of assisted reproduction in endangered species conservation.'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Wildlife plays a key role in the emergence/re-emergence of zoonotic pathogens in India.\xe2\x80\xa2Prioritizing research on zoonotic pathogens in wildlife is essential for India\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem.\xe2\x80\xa2A multidisciplinary one-world one-health approach is necessary for a national strategy.AbstractEvolving land use practices have led to an increase in interactions at the human/wildlife interface. The presence and poor knowledge of zoonotic pathogens in India's wildlife and the occurrence of enormous human populations interfacing with, and critically linked to, forest ecosystems warrant attention. Factors such as diverse migratory bird populations, climate change, expanding human population and shrinking wildlife habitats play a significant role in the emergence and re-emergence of zoonotic pathogens from India's wildlife. The introduction of a novel Kyasanur forest disease virus (family flaviviridae) into human populations in 1957 and subsequent occurrence of seasonal outbreaks illustrate the key role that India's wild animals play in the emergence and reemergence of zoonotic pathogens. Other high priority zoonotic diseases of wildlife origin which could affect both livestock and humans include influenza, Nipah, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, plague, leptospirosis, anthrax and leishmaniasis. Continuous monitoring of India's extensively diverse and dispersed wildlife is challenging, but their use as indicators should facilitate efficient and rapid disease-outbreak response across the region and occasionally the globe. Defining and prioritizing research on zoonotic pathogens in wildlife are essential, particularly in a multidisciplinary one-world one-health approach which includes human and veterinary medical studies at the wildlife-livestock-human interfaces. This review indicates that wild animals play an important role in the emergence and re-emergence of zoonotic pathogens and provides brief summaries of the zoonotic diseases that have occurred in wild animals in India.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image"

Native and isolated preantral follicles were compared ultrastructurally. In nondomestic cats the mechanical dissection of ovaries provided 0\xe2\x80\x9312 500 follicles per ovary with a viability of 20\xe2\x80\x9350%, estimated by trypan blue staining. Even the follicles recovered from domestic cats, whose ovaries are considerable smaller than ovaries from all other felids, are characterised by only 28.7% viable follicles. The follicles from one Siberian tiger and three Indian lions were cultivated and their in vitro viability assessed by BrdU labelling. Lion follicles were comparable to domestic cat follicles with respect to BrdU incorporation. Tiger follicles were characterised by a decreased staining of granulosa cells.The ultrastructure of feline oocytes appears similar to that of most mammalian species and was only slightly affected during the isolation procedure. A central vesicular body was only observed in tiger oocytes.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIndia is a mega-diversity nation well known for its biodiversity richness, which is truly reflected in the diversity of marine and freshwater fishes. The dimensions of the biological diversity found among the Indian marine fishes have direct bearing on the diversity exemplified in the ecosystems/habitat assemblages in the marine waters of India, which in turn reflects diverse morphology and behavior among the fishes. Fish known from the fresh and marine waters of India comprise 3231 valid species constituting 9.7 percent of the total number of about 33,059 species of fish known from the world, of which the marine fish diversity alone accounts for 7.4 percent. Of the total fish diversity known from India, the marine fishes constitute 75.6 percent, comprising of 2443 species belonging to 927 genera, under 230 families of 40 orders. Among the fish diversity-rich areas in the marine waters of India, the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago shows the highest number of species, 1431, followed by the east coast of India with 1121 species and the west coast with 1071. As many as 91 species of endemic marine fishes are known to occur in the coastal waters of India. As of today, about 50 marine fishes known from India fall into the Threatened category as per the IUCN Red List, and about 45 species are Near-Threatened and already on the path to vulnerability. However, only some species (10 elasmobranchs, 10 seahorses and one grouper) are listed in Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 of the Government of India.'

This is the first study on flaviviruses and T. gondii in feral pigeons and captive zoo species in Spain. Antibodies against WNV and USUV detected in non-migratory pigeons and captive zoo animals indicate local circulation of these emerging pathogens in the study area. T. gondii was widespread in species analyzed. This finding could be of importance for Public Health and Conservation of endangered species present in zoo parks. Pigeons and zoo animals may be included as sentinel species for monitoring zoonotic pathogens in urban areas.'

Abstract: 'AbstractSalinity levels in soils, surface water, and groundwater in coastal Bangladesh have been increasing over past several decades. Present salinity concentrations have already threatened crop productions in the coastal region. Introduction of drip irrigation systems may go a long way for alleviating soil salinity problems. There is also a need for educating farmers about varied salt tolerance levels of different crops so that they could choose appropriate crops for cultivation. Development and adaptation of salt-tolerant rice and other crops and fish species seem to be the necessary steps for combating salinity problems in coastal Bangladesh prior to its complete inundation by sea level rise.'

Abstract: 'AbstractInvasion of native communities by exotic species has been among the most perverse ecological problems in recent years. In the present study, we predicted the probable distribution of two invasive plant species Mimosa diplotricha Sauvalle and Mikania micrantha Kunth in a protected tropical grassland of Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park, Assam, Northeast India using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) distribution modelling algorithm. We found that about 30\xe2\x80\x9340% (25\xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xa0km2) area of the protected area (78.8\xc2\xa0km2) have high chances of being invaded by both the invasive plants that are prime habitat to the greater one horned Rhinoceros and other important grassland dwellers. Both the models have an accuracy of AUC\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.99. Precipitation in warmest quarters played a major role among the environmental variables in spread of both the invasive plants. The findings of the present study will help the management authority to take the necessary steps in the identified area to chalk out a comprehensive strategy for control of the invasive plant species. The probable areas most likely to be invaded by the invasive plant species have to be monitored regularly, and intervention like manual uprooting needs to be scheduled during the early stage of its life cycle and before flowering. The frontline staffs of the national park need to be apprised about the ecology and impact of invasive plants for better monitoring and eradication of these detrimental plants.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa218 multi-drug resistant bacterial strains were isolated from the mangrove estuary of Sundarban.\xe2\x80\xa2Biofilm formation kinetics of the isolates was evaluated in presence of different antibiotics.\xe2\x80\xa2blaTEM gene abundance was evaluated in different parts of the Sundarban estuary.\xe2\x80\xa2blaTEM gene abundance was correlated with the distribution of heavy metals and PAHs.AbstractThe abundance and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes as emerging environmental contaminants have become a significant and growing threat to human and environmental health. Traditionally, investigations of antibiotic resistance have been confined to a subset of clinically relevant antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. During the last decade it became evident that the environmental microbiota possesses an enormous number and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes, some of which are very similar to the genes circulating in pathogenic microbiota. Recent studies demonstrate that aquatic ecosystems are potential reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARBs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Therefore, these aquatic ecosystems serve as potential sources for their transmission of ARGs to human pathogens. An assessment of such risks requires a better understanding of the level and variability of the natural resistance background and the extent of the anthropogenic impact. We have analyzed eight sediment samples from Sundarban mangrove ecosystem in India, collected at sampling stations with different histories of anthropogenic influences, and analyzed the relative abundance of the blaTEM gene using quantitative real-time PCR. The blaTEM gene abundance strongly correlated with the respective anthropogenic influences (polyaromatic hydrocarbon, heavy metals etc.) of the sampling stations. Besides, 18 multidrug-resistant (ampicillin, kanamycin, vancomycin, and tetracycline resistant) bacterial strains (ARBs) were isolated and characterized. Moreover, the effect of different antibiotics on the biofilm forming ability of the isolates was evaluated quantitatively under a variety of experimental regimes. This is the first report of preservation and possible dissemination of ARGs in the mangrove ecosystem.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (364KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe physical environment, the nonliving part of the world, sets the background for all living beings. A major factor of the physical environment is climate, which ultimately determines water availability and thermal conditions. These two factors interact to determine how an amazing variety of organisms is distributed in different parts of the world. Due to anthropogenic activities, the climate changes and its impacts are noticeable around the globe. Changes like global warming, greenhouse effect, increase in sea level, melting of glaciers, ocean warming, migration of aquatic organisms, prolonged winter and summer and habitat deterioration, are posing huge threat to aquatic ecosystem as well as living and nonliving organisms residing in it.

Title: 'The management of large mammals in relation to male strategies and conflict with people'
Author: 'R.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000632079190007V
Abstract: 'AbstractMany large mammals such as elephant, rhino and tiger often come into conflict with people by destroying agricultural crops and even killing people, thus providing a deterrent to conservation efforts. The males of these polygynous species have a greater variance in reproductive success than females, leading to selection pressures favouring a \xe2\x80\x98high risk-high gain\xe2\x80\x99 strategy for promoting reproductive success. This brings them into greater conflict with people. For instance, adult male elephants are far more prone than a member of a female-led family herd to raid agricultural crops and to kill people. In polygynous species, the removal of a certain proportion of \xe2\x80\x98surplus\xe2\x80\x99 adult males is not likely to affect the fertility and growth rate of the population. Hence, this could be a management tool which would effectively reduce animal-human conflict, and at the same time maintain the viability of the population. Selective removal of males would result in a skewed sex ratio. This would reduce the \xe2\x80\x98effective population size\xe2\x80\x99 (as opposed to the total population or census number), increase the rate of genetic drift and, in small populations, lead to inbreeding depression. Plans for managing destructive mammals through the culling of males will have to ensure that the appropriate minimum size in the populations is being maintained.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Shrimp farming is one of the most important sectors in Bangladesh.\xe2\x80\xa2However, shrimp farming has devastating effects on mangrove forests.\xe2\x80\xa2Blue carbon emissions from mangrove deforestation causes climate change.\xe2\x80\xa2Some adaptation strategies are proposed to reduce blue carbon emissions.AbstractIn Bangladesh, export-oriented shrimp farming is one of the most important sectors of the national economy. However, shrimp farming in coastal Bangladesh has devastating effects on mangrove forests. Mangroves are the most carbon-rich forests in the tropics, and blue carbon (i.e., carbon in coastal and marine ecosystems) emissions from mangrove deforestation due to shrimp cultivation are accumulating. These anthropogenic carbon emissions are the dominant cause of climate change, which in turn affect shrimp cultivation. Some adaptation strategies including Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA), mangrove restoration, and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) could help to reduce blue carbon emissions. Translocation of shrimp culture from mangroves to open-water IMTA and restoration of habitats could reduce blue carbon emissions, which in turn would increase blue carbon sequestration. Mangrove restoration by the REDD+ program also has the potential to conserve mangroves for resilience to climate change. However, institutional support is needed to implement the proposed adaptation strategies.'

Title: 'Dogs, cats, and kin: A molecular species-level phylogeny of Carnivora'
Author: 'Ingi'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790309004424
Abstract: 'AbstractPhylogenies underpin comparative biology as high-utility tools to test evolutionary and biogeographic hypotheses, inform on conservation strategies, and reveal the age and evolutionary histories of traits and lineages. As tools, most powerful are those phylogenies that contain all, or nearly all, of the taxa of a given group. Despite their obvious utility, such phylogenies, other than summary \xe2\x80\x98supertrees\xe2\x80\x99, are currently lacking for most mammalian orders, including the order Carnivora. Carnivora consists of about 270 extant species including most of the world\xe2\x80\x99s large terrestrial predators (e.g., the big cats, wolves, bears), as well as many of man\xe2\x80\x99s favorite wild (panda, cheetah, tiger) and domesticated animals (dog, cat). Distributed globally, carnivores are highly diverse ecologically, having occupied all major habitat types on the planet and being diverse in traits such as sociality, communication, body/brain size, and foraging ecology. Thus, numerous studies continue to address comparative questions within the order, highlighting the need for a detailed species-level phylogeny. Here we present a phylogeny of Carnivora that increases taxon sampling density from 28% in the most detailed primary-data study to date, to 82% containing 243 taxa (222 extant species, 17 subspecies). In addition to extant species, we sampled four extinct species: American cheetah, saber-toothed cat, cave bear and the giant short-faced bear. Bayesian analysis of cytochrome b sequences data-mined from GenBank results in a phylogenetic hypothesis that is largely congruent with prior studies based on fewer taxa but more characters. We find support for the monophyly of Carnivora, its major division into Caniformia and Feliformia, and for all but one family within the order. The only exception is the placement of the kinkajou outside Procyonidae, however, prior studies have already cast doubt on its family placement. In contrast, at the subfamily and genus level, our results indicate numerous problems with current classification. Our results also propose new, controversial hypotheses, such as the possible placement of the red panda (Ailuridae) sister to canids (Canidae). Our results confirm previous findings suggesting that the dog was domesticated from the Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus) and are congruent with the Near East domestication of the cat. In sum, this study presents the most detailed species-level phylogeny of Carnivora to date and a much needed tool for comparative studies of carnivoran species. To demonstrate one such use, we perform a phylogenetic analysis of evolutionary distinctiveness (EDGE), which can be used to help establish conservation priorities. According with those criteria, and under one of the many possible sets of parameters, the highest priority Carnivora species for conservation of evolutionary diversity include: monk seals, giant and red panda, giant otter, otter civet, Owston\xe2\x80\x99s palm civet, sea otter, Liberian mongoose, spectacled bear, walrus, binturong, and the fossa.'

Poisonings are a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in animals, particularly in domestic animals such as cattle, farm animals, and dogs. Due to the lack of a central reporting agency for animal poisonings in most Asian countries, epidemiological studies on poisoning cases have not been documented. Therefore, it becomes extremely difficult to review the full picture of animal poisonings. Drug poisonings occur commonly due to off-label use of medicines, wrong dosage, negligence, and accidental ingestion. Accidental or malicious poisonings are generally caused by insecticides, fumigants, and household products. Other types of poisoning include metals (lead, arsenic, mercury and copper), non metallics (selenium, nitrate and nitrites, and fluorides), drugs, household products, mycotoxins, feed associated contaminants and radiation. death in stray animals such as cattle is very common. The scarcity of adequate epidemiologic and exposure investigations in various Asian countries and the potential for short- and long-term exposure to a vast variety of agents, suggest a need for agencies to collect epidemiological data on human beings and animals.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIn Bangladesh, prawn farming is dependent on wild postlarvae (PL) because of inadequate supply of hatchery produced PL compare to the demand. Moreover, farmers prefer wild PL because the survival of wild PL is reported to be much higher than hatchery produced PL. Wild prawn PL fishing have given an employment opportunity for thousands of coastal landless and unemployed poor people in Bangladesh. On the other hand, indiscriminate wild PL fishing has notorious impact on biodiversity in coastal ecosystems due to high levels of by-catch. This has provoked imposition of ban on PL collection to conserve fisheries resources. In 2000, the Government of Bangladesh imposed ban, however, it was not implemented firmly because of the lack of alternative livelihoods for coastal poor. This paper describes the impact of wild prawn PL fishing in coastal Bangladesh and drawn a conceptual framework in relation to management of coastal fisheries resources.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Prawn farming in Bangladesh still remains dependent on wild postlarvae (PL). \xe2\x96\xba Wild prawn PL fishing has given an employment opportunity for coastal poor people. \xe2\x96\xba However, indiscriminate PL fishing has notorious impact on coastal biodiversity.'

Title: 'Conserving nature out of fear or knowledge? Using threatening versus connecting messages to generate support for environmental causes'
Author: 'Netta'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1617138115000527
Abstract: 'AbstractThreatening and connecting messages are two types of appeals commonly used to encourage conservation behaviors, yet little research has examined their psychological impacts and behavioral outcomes. This paper describes two studies contrasting these approaches with a neutral comparison and testing their effects on state levels of negative affect, caring, and openness, psychological states which we expected in turn would encourage conservation behavior. Participants viewed visually identical nature videos with no text, connecting text or negative text. They then reported on their state experiences, and were asked to engage in conservation behaviors, including supporting conservation organizations. Findings showed that connecting messages increased caring and openness, and decreased negative affect, and by doing so elicited more conservation behaviors. On the other hand, threatening messages showed no beneficial effects above a neutral comparison without an appeal. Our findings, which we contextualize in motivational theory, can be used to inform the use of messages to promote conservation.'

Abstract: 'AbstractAnimals have played a significant role in the lives of humans, not only because they are practically useful but also because they are sources of inspiration in different cultural activities, such as belief systems, art, literature, etc. Worldwide, cultural attributes of animals vary across cultures and over time, and reflect a set of cultural practices that are associated with fauna and that influence how animals are viewed, used, and treated by humans. Understanding the cultural role of animals is essential to understanding the relationships people have with them, thus making it an important ethnozoological subject of investigation. In this chapter we discuss the significance of animals in the main human cultural manifestations, which have perpetuated from the most primitive to the most contemporary societies.'

Title: 'Evaluation of the ecological effectiveness and social appropriateness of fishing regulations in the Bangladesh Sundarbans using a new multi-disciplinary assessment framework'
Author: 'Benjamin S.'

Abstract: 'AbstractFisheries research is hindered by a paucity of multi-disciplinary tools for broadly assessing the societal appropriateness and ecological effectiveness of fishing regulations. This study presents a multi-disciplinary assessment framework that combines ecological, spatial, and social research methods to reveal the knowledge, opinions, activities, and impacts of fishers. The framework is applied to a multi-gear, multi-species, data-poor coastal fishery in the Bangladesh Sundarbans to demonstrate the complementarity of the methods, commensurability of the data, and how results can be interpreted to provide a broad initial overview of the fishery in a standardized manner that can guide future research and management. Data were obtained for 26 catches across five different gear types, 62 finfish species, 20 fishing grounds that were mapped, and 67 respondents across four villages regarding their awareness, acceptability, and compliance (AAC) of eight existing and seven proposed fishing regulations. AAC scores varied starkly for different regulations, and all proposed regulations scored lower on acceptability than any existing regulation. A number of recommendations are made to improve specific gear and species regulations; for example, protecting the locally endangered species Scatophagus argus (currently under no fishing regulation) through a ban on the long-shore net that heavily impacts the species, rather than a ban on the species itself. Broader management recommendations are also made including spatially targeted enforcement, awareness raising, and capacity building approaches. The positives and limitations of the framework are discussed. The framework is particularly applicable to small-scale fisheries in the developing world, and is useful as a pilot study.'

Institutional arrangements play a crucial role in ensuring equitable benefit sharing of tourism gains among different stakeholders. We examined this role of institutional arrangements in four National Parks of the Indian Western Himalaya at varying altitude through multiple case study analysis using qualitative methods. Our results suggest that a three-tier setup involving local communities and civil society organizations, supported by enabling government policies is most efficacious in mainstreaming socio-economic development of local communities and environmental concerns in tourism management framework. Strong local institutions with intrinsic spatial linkage are required to ensure maximum benefits to all sections of society and least monetary leakages. We recommend that in natural landscapes with conflicting interests among stakeholders, a hierarchical three-tier institutional arrangement should be encouraged to achieve the goals of sustainable tourism.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Site similarity analyses in ecosystem service value transfer are limited.\xe2\x80\xa2A similarity index is proposed and integrated with meta-analytical value transfer.\xe2\x80\xa2The technique is tested on a tropical coastal wetland in India.\xe2\x80\xa2Using similarity weights produces narrower prediction intervals for transfer value.\xe2\x80\xa2Subsetting study sites based on similarity to policy site increases accuracy.AbstractPolicy demand for ecosystem service values in developing countries results in a growing use of value transfer techniques, even in the absence of primary valuations from highly comparable study sites. Current techniques provide limited guidance on how to quantitatively assess the similarity between study and policy sites and control for the effect thereof on transfer accuracy. This paper proposes a methodology for the estimation of a study-policy site similarity index and explores its application to the Akkulam-Veli wetland in Kerala, India. The use of empirical similarity weights in a meta-analytical transfer yields a narrower prediction interval for the policy site value estimate. Estimating the meta-regression model parameters on a subset of primary valuation studies with greater similarity to the policy site application is found to increase value transfer accuracy. The need for further systematic testing and potential implications of the proposed approach for value transfer practitioners are highlighted.'

It also addresses some of the shortcomings identified in existing literature by estimating the value of several intangible benefits, and disservices of forests ignored in most valuation studies, as well as the added value from intact forests as compared to from alternative landscapes. Using primary and secondary data, and economic valuation techniques the study shows that the total net benefits provided by the Nagarhole national park in Karnataka, India are considerable. The added value of benefits from the park is also higher as compared to from alternative landscapes considering just three ecosystem services. If these are factored in decision making it could strengthen the economic case for conserving forests in tropical countries such as India where there is immense pressure to divert forests for meeting development needs.'

Author: 'Ram P.'

Abstract: 'AbstractNepal is a relatively small mountainous country surrounded by India to the south, east, and west and China to the north. Forest is one of the most important natural resources of Nepal. Some 35 major forest types occur in Nepal that change abruptly, owing to a wide variation of topography, climate, and edaphic conditions. Forests are the source of livelihoods of millions of people, in particular, for rural communities. Deforestation is one of the major environmental issues in Nepal. Deforestation pressures occur throughout Nepal but are most strongly felt in many parts of Tarai and Churia. In general, the drivers of deforestation and degradation are the mixture of direct and indirect causes, such as high dependency on forest resources, unsustainable harvesting practices, illegal harvest of forest products, infrastructure development, forest fire, natural calamities, encroachment, overgrazing, lack of good governance, and ambiguous policy. Deforestation has immediate consequences for the local population in terms of increased fuel scarcity, reduced supply of fodder, and leaf-litter manure. The unpredicted erosion, landslide, and lowland flooding, due to deforestation, are also major concerns in Nepal as well as in downstream countries. Several attempts have been made so far to control the deforestation and mixed success has been achieved. The focus of the government is on good forest governance through its long-term and short-term policy provisions. Community forestry and protected areas systems in Nepal have contributed significantly in forest conservation. A priority has also been given to private forestry. Since the fuelwood is still the major energy source, alternative sources of energy should be provided on a subsidized basis throughout the country to reduce dependency on forests. Public awareness about the importance of forests and the consequences of deforestation are also important to control deforestation.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We described the major proteome of both seminal plasma and spermatozoa of coatis.\xe2\x80\xa2238 seminal plasma proteins and 246 sperm proteins were identified.\xe2\x80\xa2Calmodulin interacts with proteins of the myosin group.\xe2\x80\xa2Seminal plasma has an array of proteins that potentially modulate sperm functions.AbstractRing-tailed coati is listed as a species of least concern in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, however, there has been a sharp decline in their population. The present study was conducted to evaluate the major proteins of both seminal plasma and sperm in ring-tailed coatis. Semen sample was collected from three adult coatis and evaluated for their morphological characteristics. Further, the sample was centrifuged to separate spermatozoa from seminal plasma, and then stored in liquid nitrogen. The seminal plasma and sperm proteins were subjected to one-dimensional (1-D) sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and identified by mass spectrometry. Gene ontology and protein networks were analyzed using bioinformatics tools. Based on sperm concentration and average protein content of the semen, the concentration of protein/spermatozoon was found to be 104.69\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf44.43\xe2\x80\xaf\xce\xbcg.

In-gel protein digestion and peptide analysis by mass spectrometry revealed 238 and 246 proteins in the seminal plasma and sperm, respectively. The gene ontology analysis revealed that the proteins of seminal plasma mainly participated in cellular (35%) and regulatory (21%) processes. According to their cellular localization, seminal plasma proteins were categorized as structural (18%), extracellular (17%), and nuclear (14%) proteins with molecular functions, such as catalytic activity (43%) and binding (43%). The sperm proteins were also involved in cellular (38%) and regulatory (23%) processes, and mainly categorized as extracellular (17%), nuclear (13%), and cytoplasmic (10%) proteins. The major molecular functions of the sperm proteins were catalytic activity (44%) and binding (42%). These results indicated that the seminal plasma of ring-tailed coati has an array of proteins that can potentially modulate several sperm functions, from sperm protection to oocyte binding. However, further studies are necessary to interpret the roles of these major seminal plasma proteins in coatis.'

Abstract: 'AbstractObjectiveThe present report embodies detailed diagnostic features of five important Red listed Swertia species for easy and authentic identification along with HPTLC fingerprinting using the c-glucoxanthone mangiferin as a biomarker. The key objectives of this study were to reduce indiscriminate harvesting of different Swertia species from its natural habitat and the development of a reliable kit based on HPTLC fingerprinting to reduce adulteration in commercial trade.MethodsChromatography was performed on Silica gel 60 F254 TLC plates with ethyl acetate-glacial acetic acid-formic acid- water- 100:11.0:11.0:26 as mobile phase. Densitometric measurement was performed at \xce\xbb=254 nm. The method was found to be simple, reliable, precise and convenient for routine analysis.ResultsAlthough mangiferin was detected in substantial amount from all populations of Swertia chirata irrespective of their geographical locations and to a lesser degree in Swertia nervosa, the biomarker was totally absent in Swertia bimaculata, Swertia dilatata and Swertia paniculata.ConclusionsFloral morphology can be effectively used for the construction of an easy identification tool that can be utilized at the field level to screen out Swertia chirata from other closely related species that flower at the same time along with Swertia chirata. High Performance TLC using mangiferin as a biomarker can be utilized for quality screening and checking adulteration among different species and populations of Swertia.'

Title: 'Integrated assessment of social and environmental sustainability dynamics in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta, Bangladesh'
Author: 'R.J.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771416302712
Abstract: "AbstractDeltas provide diverse ecosystem services and benefits for their populations. At the same time, deltas are also recognised as one of the most vulnerable coastal environments, with a range of drivers operating at multiple scales, from global climate change and sea-level rise to deltaic-scale subsidence and land cover change. These drivers threaten these ecosystem services, which often provide livelihoods for the poorest communities in these regions. The imperative to maintain ecosystem services presents a development challenge: how to develop deltaic areas in ways that are sustainable and benefit all residents including the most vulnerable. Here we present an integrated framework to analyse changing ecosystem services in deltas and the implications for human well-being, focussing in particular on the provisioning ecosystem services of agriculture, inland and offshore capture fisheries, aquaculture and mangroves that directly support livelihoods. The framework is applied to the world's most populated delta, the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta within Bangladesh. The framework adopts a systemic perspective to represent the principal biophysical and socio-ecological components and their interaction. A range of methods are integrated within a quantitative framework, including biophysical and socio-economic modelling and analyses of governance through scenario development. The approach is iterative, with learning both within the project team and with national policy-making stakeholders. The analysis is used to explore physical and social outcomes for the delta under different scenarios and policy choices. We consider how the approach is transferable to other deltas and potentially other coastal areas."

Abstract: 'AbstractAlthough there has been an increase in felid personality research, much more work is needed, with only 20 published studies, 17 of which focused on the domestic cat. Most studies show important implications for this type of research, but there is no consensus on terminology, method, or conclusions for felids, even at the species level. Felid personality research comes from various fields, and is often carried out with different methods, with diverse goals. This review evaluates the published research on felid personality, and addresses its reliability and validity. Only 60% of the studies reported reliability estimates, and these varied greatly across personality dimensions. The sample weighted mean correlation of the reliability estimates was 0.68 (based on three studies). Fifty-five percent of the studies assessed validity. The personality dimensions with the highest validity for all species were Sociable, Dominant, and Curious, with a mean correlation of 0.82. Recommendations for future research and implications for aiding in conservation and captive animal management efforts and improving health and well-being and welfare are discussed.'

Abstract: 'AbstractFrom allozymes in 1983 to whole genomes in 2015, genetic studies of the cheetah have been extensive. In this chapter we provide an overview of the available literature. Overall, patterns of genetic variation provided evidence of low variability and suggest this loss occurred thousands of years ago. Differences between published subspecies were supported genetically. At a local scale, populations were generally considered panmictic with minor genetic structure. Although cheetahs have persisted despite low genetic variability, important questions arise from these findings: Does the cheetah have the ability to adapt to and evolve with future changes in environmental and infectious pressure? How would cheetahs cope with further loss of genetic diversity? Connectivity in the wild should be maintained via prevention of habitat loss, while management of small isolated populations may require reestablishing gene flow. Genetics could assist captive-breeding decisions and provide forensic evidence as to the geographical origin of illegally traded animals.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2This is the first exhaustive study on marine plant biota dislodged during trawling operations.\xe2\x80\xa2The quantum of biomass of plant biota destroyed during trawl operations is alarming.\xe2\x80\xa2More conservation efforts are required to prevent the destruction of plant biota during trawling.AbstractBaseline information about the quantitative aspects of the marine plant biota dislodged and discarded during the trawl fishery is not available in the literature. An attempt was made to document the diversity and biomass of plant biota (seaweeds and seagrasses) destroyed and discarded during the trawl operations along the Tuticorin (renamed as Thoothukudi), Southeast coast of India. Fifteen species of seaweeds and three species of seagrasses were recorded during the study period. The biomass of plant biota discarded was 5 to 50 kg/haul/h during the study period, and the average discard was higher (44.4%) in the pre-monsoon season. The biomass dislodged mainly constituted the seagrasses (63.0%) whereas seaweeds contributed to the extent of 37.0 % of the total biomass. The variation in the values of the biomass of seaweeds and seagrasses shows no statistically significant difference (p-value >0.05) between the seasons. Among the seaweeds, Solieria robusta was most severely damaged species (9 kg/haul/h) whereas the seagrass Cymodocea serrulata was destroyed to the extent of 30 kg/haul/h. In the context of growing environmental and ecological significance of the marine plant biota for ecological balance and fisheries, this report will contribute in delineating effective policies and framework for sustainable fisheries, giving due importance to the conservation of marine flora.'

Title: 'Effectiveness of crop protection methods against wildlife damage: A case study of two villages at Bardia National Park, Nepal'
Author: 'Shova'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026121941000178X
Abstract: 'AbstractConflicts due to damage caused by wildlife pose serious threats to conservation. In addition, wildlife damage incurs severe economic loss to communities living in the close vicinity of the park, affecting the livelihoods and well-being of locals. While different studies have emphasised identification and quantification of crop damage problems, studies highlighting the means used for crop protection and their effectiveness are limited. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of means used by communities to protect their crops against wildlife. 117 households were visited at two Buffer Zone villages of Bardia National Park, Nepal. Findings suggested that crop depredation by wildlife was a function of several factors, such as the distance of the farmland from the park, the size of the crop raiding animals and the frequency of attacks on the farmland, and the type of crops. Ten different means were identified by communities which were used regularly to prevent crop damage. Households combined both traditional and modern means to guard their crop against the wild animals. Means differed according to the animals as well as crops being protected. Among all these means, Machan (i.e. watch towers) combined with other means such as throwing flaming sticks and group shouting were the most effective and safest modes of crop guarding for all kinds of animals and crops. Trench and Bio-fencing were effective mostly for deer species. However, crop guarding was an intensive process and no means were able to completely prevent crop damage. Problem animals differed according to the villages and crops being damaged, which suggests that employment of single means would be ineffective. Site-specific management strategies and economic as well as technical support from funding organisations would be most useful to minimise crop loss. In addition information exchange and learning between farmers and the park management about different mitigating means could support and prepare farmers for improvement in the means.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We discuss the extinction of the Javan rhinoceros from Vietnam.\xe2\x80\xa2Poaching and weak law enforcement was the proximate cause of the extinction.\xe2\x80\xa2Many other factors influenced the extinction of the Javan rhinoceros from Vietnam.\xe2\x80\xa2We evaluate the adequacy of the conservation response for this taxon.\xe2\x80\xa2Lessons learned from this extinction should inform global conservation efforts.AbstractThe extinction of the Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus) from Vietnam in 2010 was a conservation tragedy. Hunting has been the primary driver of the catastrophic decline of Javan rhinoceros throughout its range. The last individual from Vietnam was poached in 2010. To help avert repeating such outcomes with similarly imperiled species, this case study presents a state-pressure-response framework, considering the rhinoceros\xe2\x80\x99s historical and current status, the pressures it faced, and the adequacy of the conservation response. The failure at the site level to protect the rhinoceros population ultimately resulted in its demise. Low political will to take decisions required to recover the species and inadequate focus from the conservation and donor community further contributed to the subspecies\xe2\x80\x99s extinction, in part due to a lack of knowledge on population status. Lessons from this example should inform the conservation of other very threatened large vertebrates, particularly in Southeast Asia.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Global aquaculture is confronted with various environmental threats and disruptions, such as global climate change.\xe2\x80\xa2Coastal Bangladesh, where shrimp is cultured, is frequently affected by cyclones and storm surges that severely damage the entire coastal aquaculture.\xe2\x80\xa2The paper examines how and to what extent shrimp aquaculture in Bangladesh becomes vulnerable and builds resilience to global climate change.AbstractIn the context of the exhaustion of marine fisheries, aquaculture increasingly plays a mounting role in the world economy and food security. However, it is confronted with and deeply affected by various threats and disruptions caused by global climate change. Bangladesh, a key site for global aquaculture production, contributes very little to global green-house gas emissions; however, it is one of the worst victims of climatic turmoil. While Bangladesh earns a large amount of foreign currency from the commercial shrimp providing livelihoods for millions, its goal of a sustainable aquaculture is recently hindered by its exposure to climate change vulnerability and extremes. Coastal Bangladesh, where shrimp is cultured, is frequently affected by extreme climatic disruptions like cyclones and storm surges that severely damage the entire coastal aquaculture.

Abstract: 'AbstractThe forest musk deer (FMD, Moschus berezovskii) is a threatened species in China. Although crucial for its artificial breeding management and thus protection, to date, gonadal steroidogenic activity data are unavailable in this species. Thus, the objectives of the present study were to characterize ovarian activity throughout the estrous cycle, non-pregnant luteal phase, and gestation in female FMD. These goals were accomplished using an enzyme immunoassay to measure fecal concentrations of estradiol (E2) and progesterone. Fecal samples were collected from female FMD (aged 3\xe2\x80\x934 years) for one year, including during breeding and non-breeding seasons. Non-pregnant estrous cycles were recorded in females, based on fecal progesterone concentrations, their overall estrous cycle length was (mean\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa0SEM) 24.3\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.5 days, with 21.6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.5 days in the luteal phase and 2.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.3 days in the inter-luteal phase. Fecal progesterone and E2 concentrations were also measured in females that became pregnant and gave birth after gestating approximately 6 months. Two weeks after becoming pregnant, the average fecal progesterone concentration was significantly greater than that during non-pregnancy. The average fecal progesterone concentrations during pregnancy increased 3.2-fold above non-pregnant concentrations, decreasing to non-pregnant concentrations only after parturition. By contrast, average fecal E2 concentrations during gestation and after parturition were not different from average non-pregnant concentration. In addition, no difference was observed between progesterone concentration in the first month after pregnancy and the value during the luteal phase. However, progesterone concentration during the second month of pregnancy was significantly higher than the value during the luteal phase. In conclusion, monitoring fecal progesterone is an effective method for assessing ovarian function in FMD and will be a useful tool for breeding management and development of assisted reproductive techniques, such as artificial insemination, in this species.'

Title: 'Technical noteImproved semen collection method for wild felids: Urethral catheterization yields high sperm quality in African lions (Panthera leo)'

Abstract: 'AbstractFor wild and domestic felids, electroejaculation (EE) is the most common semen collection method. However, the equipment is expensive, there is a risk of urine contamination and animals usually show strong muscular contraction despite general anesthesia. Accordingly, we tested the feasibility of a different approach using urethral catheterization (UC) in seven African lions, previously described for domestic cats only. After general anesthesia with the \xce\xb12-agonist medetomidine (which also stimulates semen release into the urethra) and ketamine, a transrectal ultrasound was performed to locate the prostate. A commercial dog urinary catheter (2.6 or 3.3 mm in diameter) was advanced approximately 30 cm into the urethra to allow semen collection into the lumen of the catheter by capillary forces. After retraction, sperm volumes between of 422.86 \xc2\xb1 296.07 \xce\xbcl yielded motility of 88.83 \xc2\xb1 13.27% (mean \xc2\xb1 SD) with a mean sperm concentration of 1.94 \xc3\x97 109/ml. Here we describe a simple, field friendly and effective method to attain highly concentrated semen samples with excellent motility in lions and potentially other wild felid species as an alternative to electroejaculation.'

Abstract: 'AbstractEnergy poverty remains an enduring challenge in Bangladesh, with 41 million people lacking electricity. Foreign states, corporations, and financial institutions have historically shaped the form and terms of the country\xe2\x80\x99s energy system, which is predominantly fossil fuel based. Shifting geographies of energy extraction and processing continue to reflect this past and influence current national energy debates in Bangladesh. The Rampal coal-fired energy project, a joint initiative with India, exemplifies these tensions. Opposition to the Rampal plant, proposed in the ecologically sensitive Sundarbans region, and other controversial energy extraction and processing projects led some activists and impacted stakeholders to promote the idea of \xe2\x80\x9cour energy, our rights.\xe2\x80\x9d The articulation of an energy rights discourse asserts that Bangladesh should extract and control national energy resources in a manner that respects rights and provides the basis for analyzing the energy justice landscape in the nation and beyond. The rights discourse rejects the nation\xe2\x80\x99s legacy of poor energy decisions, and the associated realities of energy poverty. Contributing to emerging ideas around the geographies of energy justice, this research paper explores the practical application by activists and stakeholders of rights discourses to contested energy projects in Bangladesh. It shows how distributional energy justice activism critiques the historical political economy of economic liberalization and energy exploitation in the country and centers the rights concerns of energy poverty while also considering climate change vulnerabilities.'

Abstract: "AbstractThe vegetation of a newly created tiger sanctuary in south-western Nepal is described in detail. Six major vegetational associations were identified. It was found that several subtypes of Shorea robusta forest covered over 70% of the land area of the reserve. Open grassland, savannah, and riverine forest accounted for the rest. Modifying factors which have altered vegetational composition and wildlife habitat are discussed. The most serious of these influences have been man's activities in relation to clearing for cultivation, grazing of domestic stock, and uncontrolled burning. A model of successional patterns observed within the Karnali-Bardia Wildlife Reserve is proposed."

Abstract: 'AbstractPreviously extensive tall grasslands, and their associated fauna, are now restricted to small fragments in protected areas in lowland Nepal and northern India. Conservation management of the remaining grasslands has been hindered by the lack of a grassland classification. A classification of the grasslands in four protected areas in Nepal is presented. Two hundred and forty six plant species were recorded and nine species assemblages, with eight phases, were identified. Royal Chitwan National Park contained the greatest diversity of assemblages, whilst Royal Bardia National Park and Royal Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve, were of conservation significance for the occurrence of an Imperata cylindrica assemblage and its associated fauna. Early successional assemblages dominated by Saccharum spontaneum and Phragmites karka predominated in Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve. The spatial and temporal distribution of grassland assemblages is primarily influenced by fluvial processes but also by fire, cutting and grazing. Changes in the impact of these disturbances, for example as a result of dam building or a change in the fire regime, will alter the diversity and distribution of the plant assemblages together with their associated fauna. Immediate conservation action should involve controlling grazing in Koshi Tappu, removing invading woody species from Imperata cylindrica grassland and mapping the distribution of assemblages in all protected areas. \xc2\xa9'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe significance of transport sector is taking precedence over other sectors especially after globalisation. The performance of minor port has outpaced the major port in recent past. With the pursuit of higher growth of international trade, government lays emphasis on the maritime mode of transport as it entails quite significant share in global trade in India. In the process, there is regulatory captures which sideline the existing rules and regulations and ignore the externalities stemming from the development project. There is flouting of laws and regulation in the development of Dhamra port, a minor port located in Bhadrak district of Odisha. This paper attempts to analyse the lacunae in the regulatory framework and advantage which paved the path for development of minor Dhamra port. It also discusses how those regulations have been manipulated to keep the interest of the private port proponents.'

Author: 'Md Saifur'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2International aid donors have both formal and informal interests.\xe2\x80\xa2Aid donors have economic, political, and strategic interests in the countries they fund.\xe2\x80\xa2Development aid serves to advance donors\xe2\x80\x99 informal self-interests.\xe2\x80\xa2The interests may vary from donor to donor.SummaryWhether aid serves the development needs of a recipient country rather than the interests of donors has been a topic of much debate and research in the field of development studies. Donor agencies have interests, as does any political actor, and bureaucratic politics theory states that any bureaucracy has a dual interest, consisting of delivering on its formal mandate as well as informally increasing its power by maximizing budgets, staff, and fields for political responsibility. This study aims to conceptualize the formal and informal interests of bilateral foreign donor bureaucracies in allocating aid, using Bangladesh forest development aid by USAID, GIZ, and the EU as a case study. Quantitative analysis of documents on actual spending in the context of forest development projects and qualitative analysis from detailed interviews with development aid experts are employed. Important informal interests of donor agencies were observed as follows: (1) drawing on consultants as well as products and services from the donor\xe2\x80\x99s country; (2) expanding favorable markets for the donor\xe2\x80\x99s economy; (3) increasing the donor\xe2\x80\x99s geopolitical as well as policy influence in recipient countries; (4) obtaining information that is independent from the recipient government; and (5) shaping good governance as a prerequisite for investment from donor countries. Of the three donor organizations, USAID was found to have allocated extensive aid to two activities\xe2\x80\x94consultancy, and collaboration and networking\xe2\x80\x94that advance USAID\xe2\x80\x99s informal economic and political interests. GIZ allocated major aid to recipient developmental interventions; it also advanced its informal economic and political interests (albeit to a smaller extent). The EU allocated the largest amount of aid to developmental interventions, though its informal economic and political interests were also served, even if only to a limited extent. This study concludes with key points regarding informal interests of donor bureaucracies as well as on future research fields.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper analyses the economics of biodiversity conservation in the context of a tropical forest ecosystem in the Western Ghats region of India, where coffee is the main competitor for land use. Using primary data covering a cross-section of coffee growers, the study notes that the opportunity costs of biodiversity conservation in terms of coffee benefits foregone are quite high. Even after including external costs due to wildlife damages and defensive expenditure to protect against wildlife, the NPVs and IRRs from coffee for all land holding groups were high. Including external costs, these NPVs across different land holding groups ranged between Rs 17 thousand to over Rs 106 thousand per acre at 12% discount rate, and the IRRs between 16.6% and 23%. Even if the expected benefits were to decrease by 20% and costs rise by a similar proportion, still the IRRs from coffee were quite high (19.5\xe2\x80\x9320.1%). The study notes that the external costs accounted for between 7% and 15% of the total discounted costs of coffee cultivation, and smaller holdings proportionately incurred higher external costs as compared to large holdings. The study also notes high transaction costs incurred by the growers to claim compensation for wildlife damages. Notwithstanding these disincentives, the study notes that the local community had a positive attitude towards biodiversity conservation and were willing to pay in terms of spending time for participatory biodiversity conservation. Taking elephants, a keystone and threatened species in Asia and the study region, for the contingent valuation survey, the study notes that the respondents are willing to spend 25.8 humandays per household annually which works to over Rs 6003 per household per annum in terms of the income foregone. They also preferred a decentralized government institution for participatory biodiversity conservation.'

In India, the first case of parentage dispute solved by the use of DNA fingerprinting technology was in 1989. Since then till date, the DNA technology has been used not only to resolve the cases of paternity and maternity disputes, but also for the establishment of individual identity in various criminal cases and for wildlife forensic identification.

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The study shows economic value of ecosystem services of Sundarbans mangroves.\xe2\x80\xa2Total economic value of provisioning services is US$ 744,000/year.\xe2\x80\xa2Total economic value of cultural services is about US$ 42,000/year.\xe2\x80\xa2Increasing tendency of revenue collection from provisioning and cultural services of Sundarbans in recent years, except for timbers.AbstractThe Sundarbans Reserve Forest, the world's largest mangroves covering 6000\xc2\xa0km2 in Bangladesh, provides a variety of ecosystem services. The real contribution of the Sundarbans Reserve Forest to the national economy has not been evaluated so far. This study aims to provide an economic estimation of the provisioning and cultural services of the Sundarbans. Official records of revenue collected by the Forest Department were the sources of information used in the economic valuation of the forest. The major provisioning services of the Sundarbans are timber, fuel wood, fish, thatching materials, honey and waxes. And the main culture service is tourism. The provisioning and cultural services provided by the Sundarbans contributed to revenue of the Forest Department on an average US$ 744,000 and US$ 42,000 per year respectively during financial year 2001\xe2\x80\x932002 to 2009\xe2\x80\x932010. The revenue collection from the forest products and tourism showed increasing trend over the study period, except for the timbers. The Forest Department produces economic benefits out of the ecosystem services without knowing the optimum limits and how long they can harness the economic benefits. A comprehensive economic valuation of the total stock and potential of all the ecosystem services of the Sundarbans as well as defining limits of sustainable yield of the services under different socio-economic and climate change scenarios would be necessary to enhance sustainable management of the forest."

Title: 'Agency in environmental education'
Author: 'Mary J.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898589897900176
Abstract: "AbstractThis paper analyzes the expression of agency in pedagogical and student-generated texts from middle school environmental education activities. It demonstrates that texts used to teach about the environment draw on linguistic resources to present environmental problems as abstractions, obscuring responsibility and agency, or as caused by generic and indeterminate agents. The result is that real social actors are not identified. While the abstraction that is achieved through suppression of agency is functional for constructing highly organized scientific and academic texts, it also allows writers to avoid attributing responsibility for environmental problems, and to suggest that solutions depend on the individual actions of students. Students reflect this presentation of agency in the texts they produce, attributing environmental problems to a generic people and suggesting that they are personally responsible for solutions. This study suggests that such representations of agency may be a barrier to achieving environmental educators' goals of moving students toward participation and problem-solving."

Abstract: 'Publisher SummaryThe Indian subcontinent is a geographically vast region located between 0\xe2\x80\x9340N and 60\xe2\x80\x93100E. It includes all of India, as well as Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Exotic breeds, cross-breeds and native breeds of sheep and cattle are all farmed in the region. In the Indian subcontinent. To date, 24 serotypes of bluetongue virus (BTV) have been recorded worldwide. Twenty-one serotypes have been reported from India, ten of these on the basis of virus isolation and eleven on the basis of neutralizing antibodies. The diagnosis of BT and identification of BTV is carried out in India using both serological- and nucleic acid-based diagnostic tests. Recurring outbreaks of clinical BT in sheep and production losses in other domestic ruminants have caused great economic loss in southern India. Native breeds of sheep that are particularly susceptible to clinical BT are reared mainly on a small scale, and therefore the disease is one of the major causes of economic loss to less-affluent farmers. The existence of 24 BTV serotypes, which largely fail to cross-protect, has made the goal of protective immunization against the disease particularly difficult to achieve in the region. Live attenuated or inactivated vaccines, based on local Indian strains of the virus, are not available, and there is no current BTV vaccination program within India. However, recent developments of inactivated or sub-unit vaccines may in the future help to control the disease in the subcontinent.'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The heterogeneity index was determined using a Shannon's diversity index of the elevation zones.\xe2\x80\xa2Heterogeneity indices and species diversity of reserves were related.\xe2\x80\xa2Heterogeneity indices of reserves were not associated with the size of reserves.\xe2\x80\xa2Reserves were preferentially established at high elevations (>2700\xc2\xa0m).\xe2\x80\xa2Future planning of reserves should focus on encompassing large elevational gradients.AbstractLandscapes consisting of heterogeneous environmental conditions (e.g. elevational gradients) are richer in species diversity than more homogeneous landscapes. Furthermore, the importance of heterogeneous landscapes has been widely acknowledged in biodiversity conservation due to expected elevational shifts in ranges as a result of climate change. This is especially important in mountainous landscapes. There is as yet no protocol that conservation planners can use to integrate landscape heterogeneity in the design of protected area (PAs) systems. In this study, we tested whether Nepal, as a whole, consists of highly heterogeneous landscapes in term of elevation, and whether heterogeneity of PAs is correlated with their size and species diversity. We developed a conservation index of elevational zones within Nepal to evaluate their representativeness in the protected area system. The results showed that, in Nepal's PAs, indices of elevational heterogeneity were strongly associated with species richness. However, heterogeneity indices were not strongly associated with sizes of PAs despite the fact that Nepal is a highly heterogeneous country. The same is true for national parks and conservation areas based on IUCN-The World Conservation Union's categories of PAs. The conservation index of elevation zones suggested a bias in reserve selection towards higher elevations. There is an urgent need to rectify past biases in reserve design so as to ensure protection of elevational heterogeneity during conservation planning, especially in these times of human-induced climate change.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image"

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\xbf\xa2The real-time PCR based assay was proposed for ivory species identification.\xe2\xbf\xa2Three extant elephant species were clearly classified by the developed assay.\xe2\xbf\xa2The assay was fully validated according to ISFG recommendation.\xe2\xbf\xa2The assay can be used in conjunction with the direct PCR method.AbstractDemand for ivory and expansion of human settlements have resulted in a rapid decline in the number of elephants. Enforcement of local and international laws and regulations requires identification of the species from which any ivory, or ivory products, originated. Further geographical assignment of the dead elephant from which the ivory was taken can assist in forensic investigations. In this study, a real-time PCR assay using melt curve analysis was developed and fully validated for forensic use. The presence or absence of three Elephantidae-specific and elephant species-specific melting peaks was used to identify the elephant species. Using 141 blood and ivory samples from the three extant elephant species, the assay demonstrated very high reproducibility and accuracy. The limit of detection was as low as 0.031\xc2\xa0ng of input DNA for conventional amplification and 0.002\xc2\xa0ng for nested amplification. Both DNA concentrations are typically encountered in forensic casework, especially for degraded samples. No cross-reactivity was observed for non-target species. Evaluation of direct amplification and nested amplification demonstrated the assay's flexibility and capability of analyzing low-template DNA samples and aged samples. Additionally, blind trial testing showed the assay's suitability application in real casework. In conclusion, wildlife forensic laboratories could use this novel, quick, and low-cost assay to help combat the continuing poaching crises leading to the collapse of elephant numbers in the wild."

Abstract: 'AbstractDuring the conservation of feline semen, the freeze\xe2\x80\x93thaw procedure in particular is responsible for inducing severe spermatozoal damage, which diminishes fertilizing ability. Therefore, cold-induced damage represents a limiting factor for the conservation of semen, particularly semen from felids, which are often affected by teratospermia. In this article, feline sperm characteristics are reported, with special reference to motility and morphology, which are more likely to be affected by conservation protocols; and moreover, the causes of cold-induced damages are described.Attention has been focused on methods to evaluate functional integrity of spermatozoa, and those applied to cat semen are reviewed. Among these, a rather recently developed technique involves fluorescent staining methods, and in particular chlortetracycline. The chlortetracycline assay applied to cryopreserved cat epididymal sperm shows that it is suitable to evaluate the functional status of cat sperm.'

Author: 'Philip'

Abstract: 'AbstractA preponderance of evidence suggests humanity is causing a mass extinction event: the sixth mass extinction since the rise of complex life on Earth. This paper takes this empirical conclusion as given and asks a philosophical question: what is the meaning of the sixth mass extinction? How should we think about it, what should we do about it, and what does it tell us about humanity and our place in the world? Conservationists typically see mass extinction as an immense loss, as does most of the general public. But how best to characterize this loss is not immediately clear, and how we do so has important practical implications. This paper focuses on three common and plausible ways to think about the sixth mass extinction: as a loss of important resources (a mistake); as interspecies genocide (a crime); and as evidence that humanity is a cancer on the biosphere (as an inevitability). Considered together, these three approaches clarify the meaning of the sixth mass extinction and suggest how humanity ought to respond to it.'

Author: 'Katrina'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800997005879
Abstract: "AbstractThe term biodiversity is now prominent in the global environment and development discourse, and increasingly influences conservation and development policy. Yet biodiversity is fraught with contested definitions and uncertainty. This paper examines some of the difficulties that the multi-dimensional nature of the concept poses in devising conservation and development policies. It explores these issues with reference to field-based research in Nepal. The case study identifies the different interest groups and stakeholders involved in biodiversity conservation and analyses the policy prescriptions they promote. It highlights inadequacies in scientific understanding of the dynamics of complex systems; the lack of historic data on resource use; and crucially, the use/misuse of existing data by different interests. Conventional wisdom dictates that local people's utilisation of resources in areas where biodiversity is high is in conflict with conservation and tourism. Access to and extraction of resources are therefore strictly controlled. The conceptualisation of biodiversity, the causes of its degradation and the solutions offered by conservation stakeholders thus has implications not only for conservation, but critically for the livelihoods and welfare of people in poor countries."

Abstract: 'AbstractMany different species of the order Carnivora are susceptible to canine distemper and the mortality rate varies greatly between species. Ailuridae, Canidae, Hyaenidae, Mustelidae, Procyonidae, Ursidae, Viverridae and now Felidae have been reported to be susceptible to canine distemper virus infection. Although distemper outbreaks in dogs, fur farms and in zoo carnivores have been greatly reduced in recent years due to vaccination, there are still regular outbreaks in free-living carnivores. Unexpected outbreaks of canine distemper have occurred in exotic felids in a California wildlife park and in the Serengeti in Tanzania as well as in javelinas (collared peccaries, Tayassu tajacu) in Arizona. Although safe and efficacious in dogs, modified live canine distemper virus vaccines may be dangerous for a variety of zoo and wildlife carnivores, especially red pandas (Ailurus fulgens) and black footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes).'

The common ingredient \xe2\x80\x94 namely, love \xe2\x80\x94 opens doors to various market-related opportunities. Among these, the exorbitant sums spent on veterinary care loom large and, in an illustrative personal story of Rocky Raccoon, reach nearly epic proportions. In practical terms, this report suggests some tips for marketing to lovers of pets. On a more spiritual level, further questions concern the author's own animal-related identity and how this self-concept manifests itself in an attempt to see the world in general and to view a film in particular through the eyes of the cat."

Title: 'Chapter 2 - Cancer Prevalence and Etiology in Wild and Captive Animals'

Abstract: 'AbstractNeoplasia has been recorded in the vast majority of metazoans. The frequent occurrence of cancer in multicellular organisms suggests that neoplasia, similar to pathogens/parasites, may have a significant negative impact on host fitness in the wild. This is supported by the fact that wildlife cancers have recently been shown to result in significantly increased levels of mortality and concomitant reduction in fitness. By thorough searches of the available literature we provide a comprehensive and an updated list of cancer prevalence and etiology in the wild. We were, however, unable to find data on nontransmissible cancer prevalence in invertebrates and consequently this chapter focuses on cancer in wild vertebrates. Although single cases of cancer are frequently encountered in the wildlife, we were only able to retrieve robust data on cancer prevalence for 31 vertebrate species (12 fish, 3 amphibians, 2 reptiles, 2 birds, and 12 mammals). Cancer prevalence among these vertebrates ranged from as low as 0.2% observed in Canada geese (Branta canadensis) to more than 50% recorded in both Santa Catalina Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis catalinae) and Cape mountain zebras (Equus zebra zebra). The high prevalence recorded in some vertebrates strongly suggests that cancer in wildlife may indeed carry significant fitness costs. In spite of this, the low number of published comprehensive studies clearly shows that so far cancer in wildlife has received insufficient attention by biologists. We hope that this chapter will act as a catalyst for further studies focusing on the impact of cancer in wild animals. The chapter additionally compares cancer recorded in French zoological parks to those obtained at other zoological parks. Finally, we provide an updated list of cancer recorded as single cases in the wild, as well as in captive animals.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThailand is bordered by the Gulf of Thailand to the east and the Andaman Sea to the west, with a total coastline of 3148\xc2\xa0km. Both coasts are influenced by the Asian tropical wet monsoonal regime and support various tropical biotopes such as mangroves, seagrass beds, and coral reefs with a great diversity of marine flora and fauna. Thailand\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystems and livelihoods of coastal communities are under pressure from aquaculture, overfishing, unregulated coastal development, and mass tourism. Thailand is also increasingly affected by climate change impacts. Government departments and NGOs are working to mitigate these problems and to protect and restore the ecosystems that provide habitat for commercially important species and alleviate coastal erosion and tsunami damage. Thailand has many terrestrial and marine national parks, and recently the government supported extensive mangrove restoration and artificial coral reef construction. Concerns remain that protected areas are not enforced efficiently and that habitat destruction continues. While community conservation programs are locally effective, a more holistic approach, closer collaboration between science, government measures, and industry, and better publication of research results will be necessary to solve future environmental problems.'

Title: 'Effect of diseases on symbiotic systems'
Author: 'Pankaj Kumar'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264716301575
Abstract: 'AbstractThere are many species living in symbiotic communities. In this study, we analyzed models in which populations are in the mutualism symbiotic relations subject to a disease spreading among one of the species. The main goal is the characterization of symbiotic relations of coexisting species through their mutual influences on their respective carrying capacities, taking into account that this influence can be quite strong. The functional dependence of the carrying capacities reflects the fact that the correlations between populations cannot be realized merely through direct interactions, as in the usual predator-prey Lotka-Volterra model, but also through the influence of each species on the carrying capacities of the other one. Equilibria are analyzed for feasibility and stability, substantiated via numerical simulations, and global sensitivity analysis identifies the important parameters having a significant impact on the model dynamics. The infective growth rate and the disease-related mortality rate may alter the stability behavior of the system. Our results show that introducing a symbiotic species is a plausible way to control the disease in the population.'

Title: "Protected species outside the protected areas: People's attitude, threats and conservation of the Yellow Monitor (Varanus flavescens) in the Far-western Lowlands of Nepal"
Author: 'Hemant R.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1617138114000879
Abstract: "AbstractAlthough there is high potential for conservation of species outside protected areas, it is often neglected in researches and conservation programs. Protected species are legally protected even outside the protected areas and can be flagships for conservation in these areas, but their conservation aspects in these areas are poorly studied. We studied conservation aspects of a poorly known species, Yellow Monitor (Varanus flavescens), which is protected in most of its range countries, outside the protected areas in the Far-western lowlands of Nepal. We studied people's relationship, attitudes and threats to the species through questionnaire survey with adults and children in Parasan Village Development Committee of Kanchanpur District. We found that most of the adults were unaware about the protected status and importance of the species, and both adults as well as children killed the species. The study revealed that most of the killing occurred in agricultural land and children were more responsible for the killing than the adults. We found that monsoon vacation in schools increased the threat to the species. Our study revealed that fear from the species was the main reason and use of the species as food, medicine and hide were other reasons for killing of the species by adults. Low awareness was the major reason behind the killing by children as most of the killing was not related to any good reasons. We estimated that 87 individuals of the species could have been killed in the area in that year. Based on available evidences, we recommend further studies to predict the vulnerability of the species. Our study suggests that raising awareness among locals about its legal status and importance is the simple and efficient measure for the conservation of the species as well as for conserving other protected species outside the protected areas."

Author: 'Guido J.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123735539001346
Abstract: 'Publisher SummaryThis chapter discusses the characteristics, taxonomy, distribution, abundance, and ecology of humpback dolphins or S. chinensis and S. teuszii. Humpback dolphins are medium-sized delphinids found in coastal waters of the eastern Atlantic, Indian, and West Pacific oceans. Genetic and morphological information indicate that they are delphinids (family Delphinidae). Humpback dolphins are characterized by a robust and medium-sized body. The melon is moderate in size, slightly depressed, and in profile slopes gradually to an indistinct junction with the long, narrow rostrum. The broad flippers are rounded at the tip and the flukes are broad and full, with a deep median caudal notch. Dorsal and ventral ridges on the caudal peduncle are well developed in African and Indian Ocean populations. Overall, humpback dolphins reach a maximum total length of 2.6\xe2\x80\x932.8 m in different parts of their distribution. A few animals exceeding 3.0 m in length have been recorded in the Arabian and Indian regions. Maximum weights of 250\xe2\x80\x93280 kg have been recorded for humpback dolphins in South Africa and Hong Kong. Humpback dolphins swim slowly at about 5 km/h, surfacing briefly at intervals of up to a minute. Socializing in humpback dolphins is characterized by individuals in close proximity showing high levels of physical interaction including body contact and frequent aerial behavior such as leaps and somersaults. Fins and flukes often break the surface of the water.'

Abstract: "Publisher SummaryThis chapter discusses the different aspects of the muddy coasts of India. India has an extensive coastline of about 7500 km, including its island territories. India's coast has been undergoing physical changes throughout the geological past. It is found that although the past tectonic phase in the Indian peninsula has been one of general emergence, the present coastal geomorphology of India has evolved largely in the background of the postglacial transgression over the pre-existing topography of the offshore zones, shore, and coast. The indented and estuarine Khambat (Cambay) region of Gujarat has the characteristics of submerged lowland. The present day coastline has a varied landscape with extensive mudflats, rocky promontories, sandy beaches, deltas, estuaries, lagoons, mangroves, and coral reefs. An examination of the Indian coast, using satellite images, at a 1:50,000 scales reveal the occurrence of extensive mud/tidal flats, particularly along India's northwestern and eastern coasts. The nonvegetated mudflats alone have a total area of about 23,400 km2, \xe2\x88\xbc 90% of which are located in the state of Gujarat in the northwest. The Great and Little Rann of Kachchh that are saline deserts and become inundated during the monsoon, cover a large area."

Title: 'Isolation of mercury resistant bacteria and influence of abiotic factors on bioavailability of mercury \xe2\x80\x94 A case study in Pulicat Lake North of Chennai, South East India'
Author: 'S. Kamala'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969705008600
Abstract: 'AbstractPulicat Lake sediments are often severely polluted with mercury compounds and other toxic heavy metals. Several mercury-resistant bacteria were isolated and identified from the sediments and all the isolates exhibited broad spectrum resistance (both organic and inorganic mercuric compounds). Mercury volatilization showed that four of the isolated Bacillus cereus strains were able to reduce water soluble ionic form of mercury into volatile form via the well known enzymatic reduction. The effect of increasing concentration of mercuric chloride and phenyl mercuric acetate in the growth of this mercury reducing strain was also determined. To study the native physico-chemical parameters, which influence the bioavailability of mercury to bacteria in Pulicat Lake ecosystem, a total of 60 water and 30 sediment samples were collected and analyzed for pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, nitrate, nitrite, silicate, phosphate, organic matter and organic carbon.Increased levels of phosphate, nitrite, nitrate, silicate, organic matter and organic carbon during the post monsoon reduce the bioavailability of mercury by forming complexes which may increase the concentration of mercury in the sediments during post monsoon.'

Title: 'ReviewRoom for improvement: Hydroclimatic challenges to poverty-reducing development of the Brahmaputra River basin'
Author: 'Patrick A.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901115300186
Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Not enough is known about the Brahmaputra basin given its geopolitical and environmental significance.\xe2\x80\xa2We summarize previous research on basin-wide environmental and socio-economic conditions.\xe2\x80\xa2We present important supplements to the literature in climate, hydrology, and irrigation demand.\xe2\x80\xa2We identify opportunities for development, as well as hazards posed.\xe2\x80\xa2We argue for a basin-wide knowledge framework supported by system-level models and better data.AbstractThe Brahmaputra river is the largest (by annual discharge) of the three in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) system, and by itself carries more flow than all but 4 rivers in the world. It is the primary water source for over 130 million people, many of whom are mired in chronic poverty. The potential in the Brahmaputra River basin for poverty-reducing development of agriculture and hydropower is great. However, progress in these sectors and others has been hindered by significant natural and anthropogenic challenges. As they attempt to develop their water resources in a manner that reduces water-related vulnerabilities, the people of the Tibet Autonomous Region of China, Bhutan, Northeast India, and Bangladesh face a number of challenges, including: endemic poverty; floods; droughts; groundwater over-abstraction; political unrest; and the broader development ambitions of the member nations (leading to net import or export of resources from the basin). To those challenges have recently been added climate change and difficult decisions regarding hydropower development. A critical compounding factor in the Brahmaputra basin is the lack of an authoritative, reliable, and comprehensive network of basin-wide information on climate, streamflow, natural hazards, and economic factors, such as agricultural production, prices, and trade. Anthropocentric development in the Brahmaputra basin must balance the goal of immediate poverty reduction with the preservation of the vulnerable, rich natural heritage of the basin, in the interest both of intergenerational human equity, and biocentric egalitarianism. In the space allotted here, we provide a snapshot of the demographic and hydroclimatic characteristics of the basin of greatest concern to water system planners aiming at poverty reduction through sustainable development. We propose that the basin's hydro-climatological, economic, and political complexities are such that a basin-wide water system knowledge platform is needed to organize quantitative thinking on potential water-related investments in the basin."

Title: '6.04 - Trophic Interactions in Coastal and Estuarine Mangrove Forest Ecosystems'
Author: 'W.P.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123747112006069
Abstract: 'AbstractMangrove habitats are among the most productive ecosystems on the Earth. Their low vegetational diversity belies a remarkable richness of associated species and trophic interactions. This contribution summarizes what is known about these interactions. Information on interaction strengths, top-down versus bottom-up control, and the consequences of species interactions for community structure is only available for a few systems. At a more fundamental level, our understanding of the relative contributions of different sources of primary productivity and the patterns and mechanisms of their exploitation by herbivores, detritivores, and deposit feeders remains quite limited. Even less is known about the movement of carbon, nitrogen, and other elements through mangrove food webs to higher trophic levels. Long-standing paradigms asserting minimal consumption of living plant tissues by herbivores and the paramount role of mangrove detritus as fuel for secondary production of crustaceans and fish are being challenged by data gathered with newer methodologies, most notably, stable isotope analysis. Much remains to be learned about the role of mangroves as nurseries for juvenile life history stages and the trophic links between mangroves and neighboring ecosystems. Ongoing and future investigations of these processes that employ a balanced mix of quantitative observation and field experiments promise to generate exciting new insights about mangrove community and ecosystem processes, and at the same time inform general food-web theory.'

Title: 'Phylogenetic relationships within mammalian order Carnivora indicated by sequences of two nuclear DNA genes'
Author: 'Li'

Abstract: 'AbstractPhylogenetic relationships among 37 living species of order Carnivora spanning a relatively broad range of divergence times and taxonomic levels were examined using nuclear sequence data from exon 1 of the IRBP gene (\xe2\x89\x881.3 kb) and first intron of the TTR gene (\xe2\x89\x881 kb). These data were used to analyze carnivoran phylogeny at the family and generic level as well as the interspecific relationships within recently derived Felidae. Phylogenetic results using a combined IRBP\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0TTR dataset strongly supported within the superfamily Califormia, the red panda as the closest lineage to procyonid-mustelid (i.e., Musteloidea) clade followed by pinnipeds (Otariidae and Phocidae), Ursidae (including the giant panda), and Canidae. Four feliform families, namely the monophyletic Herpestidae, Hyaenidae, and Felidae, as well as the paraphyletic Viverridae were consistently recovered convincingly. The utilities of these two gene segments for the phylogenetic analyses were extensively explored and both were found to be fairly informative for higher-group associations within the order Carnivora, but not for those of low level divergence at the species level. Therefore, there is a need to find additional genetic markers with more rapid mutation rates that would be diagnostic at deciphering relatively recent relationships within the Carnivora.'

Title: 'Application of criteria and indicators in community based sustainable mangrove management in the Sunderbans, India'
Author: 'Debajit'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569110000839
Abstract: 'AbstractManagement of mangroves in a sustainable ecological as well as economic way is a difficult proposition and needs multi-disciplinary intervention. This paper highlights the importance of criteria and indicators to evaluate the status of performance of communities in managing their mangroves sustainably. The framework developed on the basis of 6 principles, 12 criteria, 36 indicators and 47 verifiers had been applied for assessment of Eco-Development Committees of the Sunderbans, India. Results show the presence of a highly positive correlation between performance of the committees and condition of the mangrove environment. Level of implementation of legal and institutional management strategies to protect mangroves proves to be the essential pre-condition in achieving sustainability. The study further demonstrates the effectiveness of the developed framework in the context of community forestry since the methodology was designed to be simple and flexible so as to apply it in forest management unit level without any major difficulty.'

Abstract: 'The Indian Ocean has remained, ever since the advent of the modern era, a space subjected to competing imaginations, interests, and priorities, and it will continue to be constructed, used, and transformed amidst sociocultural and technological changes. In comparison to its Atlantic and Pacific counterparts, the Indian Ocean has been described by some as a \xe2\x80\x98forgotten ocean\xe2\x80\x99, especially in the sociospatial consciousness of the Western countries. This article is based on the assumption that it is important to systematically examine, in a geographical\xe2\x80\x93historical perspective, the ways in which the category of Indian Ocean has been conceptualized, as well as diverse processes behind socially constructed Indian Ocean space(s). Various conceptualizations of the Indian Ocean space not only result in a specific social policy but also influence the nature, scope, and thrust of \xe2\x80\x98Indian Ocean studies\xe2\x80\x99 at any given point in time.The persistent denial of existence of individuals, communities, and their alternative constructions of the Indian Ocean as a space(s) of representation by postmodern capitalism\xe2\x80\x99s dominant spatial practices is likely to result in greater international conflicts over ocean governance. The Indian Ocean is more important than ever both as \xe2\x80\x98transport space\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98strategic force field\xe2\x80\x99 and so there is increasing pressure \xe2\x80\x93 in keeping with the great void idealizations \xe2\x80\x93 to make the ocean (if \xe2\x80\x98necessary\xe2\x80\x99 by deploying military power) as friction free a surface as possible. The article concludes by saying that against the backdrop of increasingly overlapping trends of militarization and \xe2\x80\x98territorialization\xe2\x80\x99 in the Indian Ocean, the nature and scope of Indian Ocean studies needs to be broadened and deepened.'

Title: 'Evolutionary and biogeographic patterns of the Badidae (Teleostei: Perciformes) inferred from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data'
Author: 'Lukas'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790304001320
Abstract: 'AbstractWe reconstructed phylogenetic relationships of the family Badidae using both mitochondrial and nuclear nucleotide sequence data to address badid systematics and to evaluate the role of vicariant speciation on their evolution and current distribution. Phylogenetic hypotheses were derived from complete cytochrome b (1140 base pairs) sequences of 33 individuals representing 13 badid species, and using three species of Nandidae as outgroups. Additionally, we sequenced the nuclear RAG1 (1473 base pairs) and Tmo-4C4 (511 base pairs) genes from each of the badid species and one representative of the outgroup. Our molecular data provide the first phylogenetic hypothesis of badid intrarelationships. Analysis of the mitochondrial and nuclear nucleotide sequence data sets resulted in well-supported trees, indicating a basal split between the genera Dario and Badis, and further supporting the division of the genus Badis into five species groups as suggested by a previous taxonomic revision of the Badidae. Within the genus Badis, mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies differed in the relative position of B. kyar. We also used our molecular phylogeny to test a vicariant speciation hypothesis derived from geological evidence of large-scale changes in drainage patterns in the Miocene affecting the Irrawaddy\xe2\x80\x93 and Tsangpo\xe2\x80\x93Brahmaputra drainages, in the southeastern Himalaya. Within both genera, Badis and Dario, we observed a divergence into Irrawaddy\xe2\x80\x93 and Tsangpo\xe2\x80\x93Brahmaputra clades. Using a cytb substitution rate of 8.2\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa010\xe2\x88\x929 (substitutions\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0base pair\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921), we tentatively date this vicariant event at the Oligocene\xe2\x80\x93Miocene boundary (19\xe2\x80\x9324\xc2\xa0Myr). It is concordant with a hypothesized paleo connection of the Tsangpo river with the Irrawaddy drainage that was most likely interrupted during Miocene orogenic events through tectonic uplifts in eastern Tibet. Our data, therefore, indicate a substantial role of vicariant-based speciation shaping the current distribution patterns of badids.'

Author: 'Michael J.B.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320786900947
Abstract: 'AbstractThe present and past distributions of the Himalayan musk deer south of the Himalayan divide are compared. The overall range has changed little during the 20th century but severe pressures, caused by over-exploitation of the species for its musk and habitat destruction, have reduced the population to scattered pockets throughout its former distribution.The maximum area of habitat potentially available to musk deer on the south side of the Himalaya is estimated to be in the region of 50 000 km2. This amount of habitat may be capable of supporting about 200 000 musk deer but more likely it harbours only about 30 000 animals, assuming that the overall density of the Himalayan population is much the same as that of the Russian population (i.e. 0\xc2\xb76 animals km\xe2\x88\x922) which has experienced similar hunting pressures. An evaluation of the current international trade in musk indicates that the Himalayan population could reach a critically low level if present hunting pressures continue unabated. It is provisionally estimated that at least 4000 adult males are killed each year. This could mean that from 18% to 53% of the Himalayan population is harvested annually, depending on the extent to which hunting methods are indiscriminate of the age and sex of animals.Measures to conserve the species are outlined within the framework of sustainable use of living resources for development. Particular emphasis is given to the possibility of harvesting musk from wild animals for the benefit of local people living at subsistence level in remote high-altitude regions of the Himalaya.'

Abstract: "AbstractThe distribution and abundance of non-human primates in Bangladesh is presented. Roadside and forest surveys were conducted throughou the alluvial floodplains and hill regions of Sylhet, Chittagong, and Cox's Bazar. In forests, walking and vehicle transects were used to census primates. The ecology and status of major habitat types are discussed. Forest primate populations are evaluated according to habitat classification. I estimate a minimum of 140, 000 non-human primates in Bangladesh. Factors contributing to this low population are discussed."

Title: 'Population viability and management recommendations for wild water buffalo Bubalus bubalis in Kosi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, Nepal'
Author: 'Joel T.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320793901935
Abstract: 'AbstractPopulation characteristics, breeding structure, and sources of mortality of wild water buffalo Bubalus bubalis were studied in Kosi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, a small reserve located in the southeastern lowlands of Nepal, during 1987 and 1988. Comparisons with an earlier census indicated that the population was growing over a 12-year time interval. However, observations on the physical nature of the reserve and known seasonal movements of buffalo suggested that the population is not viable for several reasons. Most morality observed during the study took place over the rainy season, suggesting that flooding was the major source; half of the first-year calves disappeared during that time. Because the reserve was subject to extensive flooding during the rains, buffalo regularly left to reside in cane and sugar fields. Hence the reserve did not include the annual home range of any buffalo herds. In addition, thousands of domestic cattle and hundreds of domestic buffalo used the reserve illegally, which posed a risk of disease to wild water buffalo. Management recommendations, including a re-introduction of the species into Royal Chitwan National Park, are made in light of the analysis.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIn 2000, we conducted a survey to quantify the declines in the populations of Gyps bengalensis and G. indicus across India since 1990\xe2\x80\x931993. Directly comparable data for the two periods were obtained from over 6000 km of road transect surveys carried out in protected areas, the regions around protected areas and linking highways across the country. An additional 5000 km were covered in 2000 in previously unsurveyed areas. Further data were collected from questionnaires circulated to ornithologists, wildlife experts and forestry officials. Massive declines in the populations of both species were apparent from all parts of the country, and exceeded 92% overall. The extent of declines did not differ between protected areas and elsewhere. Apparently sick birds, with drooping necks, were observed in all regions, and dead adult and juvenile vultures were frequently observed. Food availability did not decline greatly over this period. The patterns of declines and the presence of sick and dead birds indicate epidemic disease as a possible cause. If so, this is likely to be an agent to which the population is na\xc4\xb1\xcc\x88ve, e.g. an introduced agent or one from which the species were previously isolated. Immediate steps are needed to confirm this and to identify measures that could be taken to stem the problem.'

Title: 'An assessment of the contribution of captive breeding to the conservation of rare mammals'
Author: 'N.J.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320778900356
Abstract: 'AbstractThere have been few attempts to examine the success of zoos in the establishment and maintenance of captive populations of rare animals. Annual census data for population size and births of species in zoos are now available for a 15-year period. Sixty-one of 274 rare mammal species were considered to have bred frequently enough in captivity to warrant investigation. By comparing these species with each other and with a theoretical model it proved possible to identify five consecutive stages in the development of a successful population in captivity. Species were then assigned to each stage to determine the success of breeding programmes in zoos. Twenty-six species can be considered self-sustaining. With some idea of their contribution to date, the role of zoos in conservation is discussed. It is concluded that captive-breeding for reintroduction is a much less significant role for zoos than the maintenance and development of captive populations of all species for educational and research purposes, and as insurance for the future.'

Abstract: "SummaryThe rate of extinction has accelerated to the point where we are probably losing one species per day right now, and we could well lose one million of Earth's 5\xe2\x80\x9310 million species by the year 2000, and a good many more within the early decades of the next century. Plainly we cannot assist all species that face extinction within the foreseeable future. Conservationists have limited resources at their disposal, in the way of finance, scientific skills, and the like. Even were these resources to be increased several times over, we could not hope to save more than a proportion of all species that appear \xe2\x80\x98doomed to disappear\xe2\x80\x99: the processes of habitat disruption are too strongly underway to be halted in short order. But when we allocate funds to safeguard one species, we automatically deny those funds to other species. Already we support only a small fraction of all species under threat, and we may soon find ourselves in a situation where we can assist only a very marginal number of species facing extinction. Thus a key question arises: how are we to allocate our scarce resources in the most efficient way to safeguard species? Indeed we may now have reached a stage where there is merit in determining which species are \xe2\x80\x98most deserving\xe2\x80\x99 of a place on the planet. Agonizing as it will be to make choices along these lines, conservation strategy should be as systematically selective as possible. This means that we should design analytic methodologies to enable us to assign our conservation resources to achieve maximum return in terms of numbers of species protected. In essence, a \xe2\x80\x98triage\xe2\x80\x99 strategy. An expanded approach along these lines postulates a quantum advance in our planning of responses to the growing threatened-species problem: while the techniques of the past have certainly helped the situation, we cannot confront the much greater challenges of the future with an attitude of \xe2\x80\x98'the same as before, only more so\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94the future will not be a simple extrapolation of the past, but will represent a qualitatively larger set of problems, which require an appropriately scaled-up response in our save-species campaigns."

Title: 'Non-consumptive wildlife-oriented recreation: A conceptual framework'
Author: 'David A.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320790900876
Abstract: 'AbstractRecreational non-consumptive use of wildlife has been attracting increasing numbers of people and generating growing economic benefits from tourism activity. More importantly this type of wildlife interaction has potential benefits to conservation from the long-term effect of changing attitudes towards wild animals and natural habitats. It does not, however, fit well into the existing wildlife management paradigm due to the nature of the final product, a recreation experience. This paper aims to provide an integrated framework that illustrates the major components of non-consumptive wildlife recreation and links between research areas in ecology, animal behaviour, recreation, tourism and existing wildlife management institutions. The fundamental purpose of this paper is to cast wildlife conservation in a new light that recognizes the need to formulate management plans in both a social and biological context.'

Abstract: 'AbstractInformation is given on the population status, distribution and ecology of the Ganges river dolphin, Platanista gangetica, in the Karnali River, Nepal. Seven animals were counted. Sightings were highly habitat-specific. Six habitats were identified and classified as primary or marginal, according to differences in physical characteristics and sighting frequencies within them (\xcf\x872, p < 0\xc2\xb705, d.f. = 5). Mean sighting frequencies were 0\xc2\xb757 and 0\xc2\xb713 sightings/visit for primary and marginal habitats, respectively. Primary habitats were characterized by an eddy counter-current system in the main river flow caused by a fine sand/silt point bar formed from sediment deposits of a convergent stream branch or tributary. Marginal habitats were characterized by a smaller eddy counter-current system caused by an upstream meander. Mean group size was 1\xc2\xb738 animals. Dolphin movements within primary habitats were found to be nonrandom and aggregate for 25 theodolite tracking sessions (\xcf\x872, p < 0\xc2\xb705, d.f. = 1\xe2\x80\x937), concentrated in locations of high prey availability and reduced flow. Human disturbance effects are summarized. Recommendations are given for preservation.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe Tonle Sap Great Lake in Cambodia is significant for its biological and societal diversity, as well as for the fundamental role it plays in the local and national economy. Conflicting natural resources are aggravating population pressures and governance deficits, thereby threatening the ecological and economic viability of the lake and its systems. In response to this, and as part of a broader program of governance reforms, the Cambodian government is beginning to promote integrated, systems-wide natural resources management for the Tonle Sap. A key feature of this strategy is the designation of the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve as part of the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves.'

Based on the contingent valuation surveys of 222 non-South Asian, 48 South Asian, and 40 domestic visitors, the logit regression results suggest that the visitors have a substantially higher WTP than the current entry fees. Depending on visitor categories, the estimated mean WTP per visitor per day was at least 2.5 times higher than the existing entry fee. The WTP is positively affected by the visitor's CNP experience. The current fees capture only about 21% of consumer surplus derived from CNP access. Doubling the current entry fees would modestly decrease the number of CNP visitors (<19%) but substantially increase the park revenue (>61%)."

Title: 'Exotic ticks introduced into the United States on imported reptiles from 1962 to 2001 and their potential roles in international dissemination of diseases'
Author: 'M.J.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401703000608
Abstract: 'AbstractSince 1962, a total of 29 species of exotic ticks have been introduced into the United States on imported reptiles, with 17 species from the genus Amblyomma, 11 from the genus Aponomma and one from the genus Hyalomma. In the absence of measures to control introduction of these importations, some exotic tick species will develop breeding colonies and become established as indigenous species and some tickborne diseases may be introduced to wreak havoc among susceptible native populations. However, formulation of risk assessments and rational control measures have been hampered by a lack of knowledge of these exotic ticks, with much of the available data published in older and relatively obscure publications. This report is an attempt to collate information for all 29 exotic tick species, including previously unpublished data from our laboratory, with particular reference to their geographical distribution, hosts, life cycles and vector potential, and to review methods to minimize their global dissemination.'

Abstract: 'Publisher SummaryThis chapter introduces riverine riparia, places riparian systems in a landscape context, and presents the environmental settings in which riparia occur. Riparian systems are transitional semiterrestrial areas regularly influenced by fresh water, usually extending from the edges of water bodies to the edges of upland communities. Riparia are an integral part of successful land management programs and a robust understanding of riparian ecology, as well as thorough monitoring and evaluation, is fundamental for successful planning and action. Riparian species are variously adapted to exploit the spatially and temporally dynamic habitat mosaic created by gradients in available materials and disturbance regimes. The resultant groundwater-surface water exchange pathways play major roles in structuring riparia and in determining their functional properties. Conceptually, riparia are closely linked to the main concepts of river systems ecology\xe2\x80\x94namely, the river continuum, the serial discontinuity, the flood pulse, and the hyporheic corridor concepts. However, the most effective perspective for understanding riparia is provided by the hierarchical patch dynamics concept. Habitat for riverine and riparian organisms is a constantly changing mosaic\xe2\x80\x94biophysically dynamic in space and time, and the biota are uniquely adapted to the dynamics of the system. Flow networks often encompass lakes and groundwater aquifers that are just slow-flowing environments within river continua embedded in the terra firma. Riparian vegetation may act as buffer zones along rivers in various ways. They minimize downriver flooding by physically slowing the water, absorbing it or increasing the rates of evapotranspiration. Riparia trap sediments and therefore influence downriver sedimentation. Finally, riparia constitute a habitat for rare and uncommon species, and these species may move along the unique dendritic networks of riparian vegetation.'

In the first of this two-part review article, we have provided an account of diseases caused by protozoan parasites characterised by a two-way transmission route between domestic and wild carnivore species. In this second and final part, we focus our attention on parasitic diseases caused by helminth and arthropod parasites shared between domestic and wild canids and felids in Europe. While a complete understanding of the biology, ecology and epidemiology of these parasites is particularly challenging to achieve, especially given the complexity of the environments in which these diseases perpetuate, advancements in current knowledge of transmission routes is crucial to provide policy-makers with clear indications on strategies to reduce the impact of these diseases on changing ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2An animal\xe2\x80\x99s harmfulness reduced its moral standing independently of its patiency and intelligence.\xe2\x80\xa2An animal\xe2\x80\x99s harmful disposition, not its harmful agency, primarily affected its moral standing.\xe2\x80\xa2Harmfulness reduced moral standing primarily via a speciesist concern for human welfare.\xe2\x80\xa2Contrary to past theorizing, patiency and intelligence were highly positively correlated dimensions.AbstractEntities that possess moral standing can be wronged and deserve our moral consideration. Past perspectives on the folk psychology of moral standing have focused exclusively on the role of \xe2\x80\x9cpatiency\xe2\x80\x9d (the capacity to experience pain or pleasure) and \xe2\x80\x9cagency\xe2\x80\x9d (usually defined and operationalized in terms of intelligence or cognitive ability). We contend that harmfulness (i.e., having a harmful vs. benevolent disposition) is an equally if not more important determinant of moral standing. We provide support for this hypothesis across four studies using non-human animals as targets. We show that the effect of harmfulness on attributions of moral standing is independent from patiency and intelligence (Studies 1\xe2\x80\x932), that this effect pertains specifically to an animal\xe2\x80\x99s harmful disposition rather than its capacity to act upon this disposition (Study 3), and that it primarily reflects a parochial concern for human welfare in particular (Study 4). Our findings highlight an important, overlooked dimension in the psychology of moral standing that has implications for real-world decisions that affect non-human animals. Our findings also help clarify the conditions under which people perceive patiency and agency as related versus truly independent dimensions.'

Title: 'Ecoengineering with Ecohydrology: Successes and failures in estuarine restoration'
Author: 'Michael'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771416301044
Abstract: 'AbstractEcological Engineering (or Ecoengineering) is increasingly used in estuaries to re-create and restore ecosystems degraded by human activities, including reduced water flow or land poldered for agricultural use. Here we focus on ecosystem recolonization by the biota and their functioning and we separate Type A Ecoengineering where the physico-chemical structure is modified on the basis that ecological structure and functioning will then follow, and Type B Ecoengineering where the biota are engineered directly such as through restocking or replanting. Modifying the physical system to create and restore natural processes and habitats relies on successfully applying Ecohydrology, where suitable physical conditions, especially hydrography and sedimentology, are created to recover estuarine ecology by natural or human-mediated colonisation of primary producers and consumers, or habitat creation. This successional process then allows wading birds and fish to reoccupy the rehabilitated areas, thus restoring the natural food web and recreating nursery areas for aquatic biota. We describe Ecohydrology principles applied during Ecoengineering restoration projects in Europe, Australia, Asia, South Africa and North America. These show some successful and sustainable approaches but also others that were less than successful and not sustainable despite the best of intentions (and which may even have harmed the ecology). Some schemes may be \xe2\x80\x98good for the ecologists\xe2\x80\x99, as conservationists consider it successful that at least some habitat was created, albeit in the short-term, but arguably did little for the overall ecology of the area in space or time. We indicate the trade-offs between the short- and long-term value of restored and created ecosystems, the success at developing natural structure and functioning in disturbed estuaries, the role of this in estuarine and wetland management, and the costs and benefits of Ecoengineering to the socio-ecological system. These global case studies provide important lessons for both the science and management of estuaries, including that successful estuarine restoration is a complex and often difficult process, and that Ecoengineering with Ecohydrology aims to control and/or simulate natural ecosystem processes.'

Abstract: 'AbstractInformation regarding the reproductive biology of black-footed cats (BFC) and sand cats (SC) is extremely limited. Our objectives were to: (1) validate fecal hormone analysis (estrogens, E; progestagens, P; androgens, T) for noninvasive monitoring of gonadal activity; (2) characterize estrous cyclicity, ovulatory mechanisms, gestation, and seasonality; and (3) evaluate male reproductive activity via fecal androgen metabolites and ejaculate traits.

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper presents a new theoretical framework for the study of environmental consumption at the micro-level by building on concepts from classical sociological theory and recent macro-level studies of the environment. The framework emphasizes the local community context as an important determinant of environmental consumption. We test this framework with unique micro-level data on consumption, household size, household affluence, and community context from Nepal, a setting in the midst of dramatic change in community organization, population size, and consumption behavior. The results of these tests are consistent with the hypothesis that local non-family organizations shift the consumption of environmental resources from direct to more indirect. We argue that the framework presented here is a useful early step toward more comprehensive micro-level models of environmental quality.'

Abstract: "AbstractThere is substantial economic potential for exploiting wildlife resources for non-consumptive wildlife-oriented recreation (NCWOR) tourism and this type of tourism if well managed, can result in the long-term conservation of wildlife resources. This is especially important in cases where wildlife resources are declining due to habitat destruction, poaching and other human threats, as is so for sea turtles. In this paper, relevant ecotourism literature outlining the economic values of NCWOR activities is reviewed to show that a significant potential exists for developing sea turtle-based tourism.

Tourism Management, 19 (6), 521\xe2\x80\x93531) is analysed to see if it might be applied to sea turtle-based ecotourism in Australia at Mon Repos Conservation Park. Threats to sea turtle populations are growing especially as a result of human activities and these underline the importance of finding an economic rationale to conserve the remaining species. Economic benefits from turtle-based tourism can provide such a rationale. However, such tourism must be managed appropriately if it is to be sustained. Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service has adopted management strategies at Mon Repos Conservation Park with this in mind and these strategies are outlined."

Title: 'Methodological and ideological optionsIs sustainability optimal? Examining the differences between economists and environmentalists'
Author: 'William K.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/092180099500040G
Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper examines a number of possible explanations for the apparent differences between economists and environmentalists concerning economic growth and sustainable development. Some of the differences are well known and relate to issues such as resource scarcity, intergenerational equity, and the composition of social capital. However, our analysis finds that while economic notions of optimal growth and the techniques of benefit-cost analysis have important advantages for evaluating complex tradeoffs because they are quantifiable, they may have potentially serious drawbacks as well. The paper focuses on two potential sources of bias in the use of welfare economics for social choice: First, there is a \xe2\x80\x9cconservative reinforcement\xe2\x80\x9d in benefit-cost analysis which is likely to produce biases against policy interventions to protect a degraded environment. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the aggregation of individual willingness to pay as a measure of social benefits is shown to be invalid in the case of \xe2\x80\x9cpositional goods\xe2\x80\x9d, where the demand for the good reflects the desire of individuals to raise their own relative standing. This error may cause the economic calculus to be biased against non-positional goods, including non-rival goods such as environmental resources. These biases further complicate the already strained assumptions in utilitarian-based welfare economics that, by relying on revealed preference and consumer sovereignty, are unable to distinguish between, or apply different weights to, the satisfaction of different categories of preferences. Furthermore, because the dynamic consequences of even small biases in judging social optimality may give rise to large social costs or advance an unsustainable path, there is a danger in relying solely on a potentially biased measure of welfare as a basis for guiding social choice. The paper concludes by suggesting that efforts to correct these drawbacks of economic analysis are likely to result in approaches to sustainable development that narrow the apparent differences between economists and environmentalists.'

Title: 'ReviewOccurrence, bioavailability and toxic effects of trace metals and organic contaminants in mangrove ecosystems: A review'
Author: 'St\xc3\xa9phane'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412012001730
Abstract: 'AbstractAlthough their ecological and socioeconomic importance has received recent attention, mangrove ecosystems are one of the most threatened tropical environments. Besides direct clearance, hydrological alterations, climatic changes or insect infestations, chemical pollution could be a significant contributor of mangrove degradation. The present paper reviews the current knowledge on the occurrence, bioavailability and toxic effects of trace contaminants in mangrove ecosystems. The literature confirmed that trace metals, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) and Endocrine Disrupters Compounds (EDCs) have been detected in various mangrove compartments (water, sediments and biota). In some cases, these chemicals have associated toxic effects on mangrove ecosystem species, with potential impact on populations and biodiversity in the field. However, nearly all studies about the bioavailability and toxic effects of contaminants in mangrove ecosystems focus on selected trace metals, PAHs or some \xe2\x80\x9cconventional\xe2\x80\x9d POPs, and virtually no data exist for other contaminant groups. The specificities of mangrove ecosystems (e.g. biology, physico-chemistry and hydrology) support the need for specific ecotoxicological tools. This review highlights the major data and methodological gaps which should be addressed to refine the risk assessment of trace pollutants in mangrove ecosystems.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Trace contaminants have been detected in various mangrove compartments. \xe2\x96\xba Some trace contaminants have been associated with toxic effects on mangrove ecosystem species. \xe2\x96\xba Nearly all studies in mangrove ecosystems focus on selected trace metals, conventional POPs or PAHs. \xe2\x96\xba The present review highlighted major data gaps in the understanding of ecotoxicology in mangroves.'

Abstract: 'AbstractBuddhism provides a powerful force in the lives of large numbers of people in Burma. The military junta ruling Burma has recognized and attempted to appropriate Buddhism as a means of legitimating its authority. This regime has consistently promoted the notion of national unity and identity in which strong links with a Buddhist Burmese heritage have been forged. This desire for Burma to become more fully integrated into the global economy has seen the encouragement of foreign investment and the promotion of the country as a destination. A strong relationship has been established between Buddhism and tourism, and this link has been appropriated by the regime in seeking to achieve its political and economic aspirations.'

Title: 'Chapter 2 Violence Toward Other Species'
Author: 'Ronald'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166411508610559
Abstract: "Publisher SummaryThis chapter examines some historical aspects of violence, aggression, and cruelty to other species. The chapter describes the hypothesis that generalizes the treatment of animals to humans or vice versa. From an ecological or sociobiological perspective human predation, competition, or parasitism cannot be considered cruel unless these interactions do not benefit humans or humanity. Many, varied, and symbolic interactions with other species have made possible varieties of violence that eventually produced restraining legislation in modern, and industrial societies. The determinants of cruelty to animals, defined as intentional injury by an aggressor believes that animals share some human experiences and derives no benefit from the aggression. Little is known about children's reactions to animals, the processes by which their adult attitudes are formed, the ways in which they generalize from animals to people, and the extent to which adults perceive animals as similar to people. The human relationships with members of other species, including violence, aggression, and cruelty, is not studied by psychology as a dimension of adult personality."

Title: '5 - Rabies in Terrestrial Animals'
Author: 'CATHLEEN A.'

Abstract: 'Publisher SummaryRabies is the most important viral zoonosis and an occupational hazard to all of those exposed to particular animals, intentionally or accidentally. Preventive public health practices of vaccination, leash restraint, confinement, observation, quarantine relate directly to animals. Pure, potent, safe, and effective rabies vaccines are developed through evaluation in experimental trials in animals. Elimination of the source of rabies in animals is a desirable goal. However, elimination of animal populations as a means to control rabies, because a particular species is a reservoir, is neither achievable nor desirable. In the 21st century, with highly effective methods for the prevention of human rabies, including effective tools for the elimination of rabies in dogs, there is a successful extinction of many unique rabies virus variants. In particular, significant advances are made in the past 25 years in the control and elimination of rabies in major wildlife sources through oral vaccination.'

Abstract: "AbstractResistance and struggle against the dominance of Western imperialist nations and their hegemonic ideology has become a defining characteristic of the women's movement in many poor nations like India. During the colonial period the West intersected with Indian social structures and norms at many times, and the meeting of the two shaped what is now specifically Indian. In the contemporary period some parallels can be drawn between feminist practices in the West and in India. Although the work of women's organizations is mediated by Indian culture, which gives Indian feminism its own distinct character, they are nevertheless informed in a number of ways by the West. Consequently it becomes difficult to completely separate Indian dimensions of the Indian women's movement from Western."

Title: '4 - Medically Significant Bites by \xe2\x80\x9cColubrid\xe2\x80\x9d Snakes'
Author: 'Scott A.'

Abstract: 'Publisher SummaryThis article is a review of published case reports of bites by colubrid snakes, with the first section being the epidemiology of snake bites in South America, India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Nigeria, Middle East and Guam. The background and general features of documented bites of various genera such as genus boiga, philodryas, thamnophis, heterodon, hemorrhois, platyceps, hierophis, coluber and alsophis are discussed in detail. Life-threatening and fatal cases inflicted by venomous colubrid snakes have been documented as well. The lack of verified identity of snakes responsible for reported bites and perceived versus evidence based risk has been classified under pitfalls noted in documented cases. The recommendations for management of medically significant colubrid bites are classified under general and specific. The recommended first aid for any snake bite would be the globally applicable, WHO recommended use of immobilization of the bitten limb and patient. However, the use of pressure immobilization for hazard 1 colubrid bites has no direct evidence to support its use. At the same time, limited Australian experience may show a positive benefit for PI in delaying the early stages of envenoming. Evaluation of patient, confirmation of snake identification, toxinologist consultation, wound care, basic supportive measures, antivenom come afterwards.'

Title: 'Biology of mangroves and mangrove Ecosystems'
Author: 'K.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065288101400034
Abstract: "AbstractMangroves are woody plants that grow at the interface between land and sea in tropical and sub-tropical latitudes where they exist in conditions of high salinity, extreme tides, strong winds, high temperatures and muddy, anaerobic soils. There may be no other group of plants with such highly developed morphological and physiological adaptations to extreme conditions.Because of their environment, mangroves are necessarily tolerant of high salt levels and have mechanisms to take up water despite strong osmotic potentials. Some also take up salts, but excrete them through specialized glands in the leaves. Others transfer salts into senescent leaves or store them in the bark or the wood. Still others simply become increasingly conservative in their water use as water salinity increases Morphological specializations include profuse lateral roots that anchor the trees in the loose sediments, exposed aerial roots for gas exchange and viviparous waterdispersed propagules.Mangroves create unique ecological environments that host rich assemblages of species. The muddy or sandy sediments of the mangal are home to a variety of epibenthic, infaunal, and meiofaunal invertebrates Channels within the mangal support communities of phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish. The mangal may play a special role as nursery habitat for juveniles of fish whose adults occupy other habitats (e.g. coral reefs and seagrass beds).Because they are surrounded by loose sediments, the submerged mangroves' roots, trunks and branches are islands of habitat that may attract rich epifaunal communities including bacteria, fungi, macroalgae and invertebrates. The aerial roots, trunks, leaves and branches host other groups of organisms. A number of crab species live among the roots, on the trunks or even forage in the canopy. Insects, reptiles, amphibians, birds and mammals thrive in the habitat and contribute to its unique character.Living at the interface between land and sea, mangroves are well adapted to deal with natural stressors (e.g. temperature, salinity, anoxia, UV). However, because they live close to their tolerance limits, they may be particularly sensitive to disturbances like those created by human activities. Because of their proximity to population centers, mangals have historically been favored sites for sewage disposal. Industrial effluents have contributed to heavy metal contamination in the sediments. Oil from spills and from petroleum production has flowed into many mangals. These insults have had significant negative effects on the mangroves.Habitat destruction through human encroachment has been the primary cause of mangrove loss. Diversion of freshwater for irrigation and land reclamation has destroyed extensive mangrove forests. In the past several decades, numerous tracts of mangrove have been converted for aquaculture, fundamentally altering the nature of the habitat. Measurements reveal alarming levels of mangrove destruction. Some estimates put global loss rates at one million ha y\xe2\x88\x921, with mangroves in some regions in danger of complete collapse. Heavy historical exploitation of mangroves has left many remaining habitats severely damaged.These impacts are likely to continue, and worsen, as human populations expand further into the mangals. In regions where mangrove removal has produced significant environmental problems, efforts are underway to launch mangrove agroforestry and agriculture projects. Mangrove systems require intensive care to save threatened areas. So far, conservation and management efforts lag behind the destruction; there is still much to learn about proper management and sustainable harvesting of mangrove forests.Mangroves have enormous ecological value. They protect and stabilize coastlines, enrich coastal waters, yield commercial forest products and support coastal fisheries. Mangrove forests are among the world's most productive ecosystems, producing organic carbon well in excess of the ecosystem requirements and contributing significantly to the global carbon cycle. Extracts from mangroves and mangrove-dependent species have proven activity against human, animal and plant pathogens. Mangroves may be further developed as sources of high-value commercial products and fishery resources and as sites for a burgeoning ecotourism industry. Their unique features also make them ideal sites for experimental studies of biodiversity and ecosystem function. Where degraded areas are being revegetated, continued monitoring and thorough assessment must be done to help understand the recovery process. This knowledge will help develop strategies to promote better rehabilitation of degraded mangrove habitats the world over and ensure that these unique ecosystems survive and flourish."

Title: ' - Fundamental Cryobiology of Mammalian Spermatozoa'
Author: 'Dayong'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123997708500071
Abstract: "Publisher SummaryThis chapter discusses the fundamental cryobiology of mammalian spermatozoa. The low motility of cryopreserved mammalian spermatozoa and the often lower conception rates may be due to the fact that procedures for cryopreservation of many mammalian cell types, including sperm, have evolved empirically. The primary assay of sperm function is the use of insemination and measurement of pregnancy initiation. The approaches to measuring sperm plasma membrane integrity include supervital staining and hyposmotic swelling. The other general approach to evaluating plasma membrane integrity is to assay the maintenance of membrane semipermeability by testing the cell's ability to change its volume when exposed to anisomotic conditions. Survival of cells subjected to cryopreservation depends not only on the presence of a permeating cryoprotective agent (CPA) but also on the concentration of the CPA. Viability of mammalian sperm is very sensitive to osmotic stress and the associated cell volume excursion. The optimization of CPA addition and removal procedures is also elaborated."

Title: '5 - Animal Rabies'
Author: 'Michael'

Abstract: 'Publisher SummaryThis chapter reviews the basic principles of animal rabies related to host range, susceptibility, clinical signs, differential diagnosis, and transmission. It discusses the salient examples of these topics in selected domestic and wildlife species. The successful lyssavirus infection depends on three events: initial direct contact with the surface of a receptive host cell, protein translation in the intracytoplasmic environment culminating in viral assembly at the cell membrane, and egress from the cells of the old host to renew the process. The viral process of entrance, self-production, and exit of progeny, extrapolated from the biochemical, cellular, and tissue levels of organization to an entire organism, forms the basis of susceptibility, or the innate capability of an animal to become rabid and infectious to other hosts. Trends in species susceptibility are greatly influenced by host species attributes and, by individual host factors, such as the immunologic status and age. Generalities about species susceptibility can be inferred from selected sets of experimental data and within the limitations of epidemiologic observations.'

Title: 'ReviewThe habitat function of mangroves for terrestrial and marine fauna: A review'
Author: 'I.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304377007001830
Abstract: 'AbstractMangroves are defined by the presence of trees that mainly occur in the intertidal zone, between land and sea, in the (sub) tropics. The intertidal zone is characterised by highly variable environmental factors, such as temperature, sedimentation and tidal currents. The aerial roots of mangroves partly stabilise this environment and provide a substratum on which many species of plants and animals live. Above the water, the mangrove trees and canopy provide important habitat for a wide range of species. These include birds, insects, mammals and reptiles. Below the water, the mangrove roots are overgrown by epibionts such as tunicates, sponges, algae, and bivalves. The soft substratum in the mangroves forms habitat for various infaunal and epifaunal species, while the space between roots provides shelter and food for motile fauna such as prawns, crabs and fishes. Mangrove litter is transformed into detritus, which partly supports the mangrove food web. Plankton, epiphytic algae and microphytobenthos also form an important basis for the mangrove food web. Due to the high abundance of food and shelter, and low predation pressure, mangroves form an ideal habitat for a variety of animal species, during part or all of their life cycles. As such, mangroves may function as nursery habitats for (commercially important) crab, prawn and fish species, and support offshore fish populations and fisheries. Evidence for linkages between mangroves and offshore habitats by animal migrations is still scarce, but highly needed for management and conservation purposes. Here, we firstly reviewed the habitat function of mangroves by common taxa of terrestrial and marine animals. Secondly, we reviewed the literature with regard to the degree of interlinkage between mangroves and adjacent habitats, a research area which has received increasing attention in the last decade. Finally, we reviewed current insights into the degree to which mangrove litter fuels the mangrove food web, since this has been the subject of long-standing debate.'

Title: 'Infanticide among animals: A review, classification, and examination of the implications for the reproductive strategies of females\xe2\x98\x86'
Author: 'Sarah Blaffer'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0162309579900049
Abstract: 'AbstractInfanticide among animals is a widespread phenomenon with no unitary explanation. Although the detrimental outcome for the infant is fairly constant, individuals responsible for infanticide may or may not benefit, and when they gain in fitness there may be considerable variation in how they gain. Sources of increased fitness from infanticide include: (1) exploitation of the infant as a resource, (2) elimination of a competitor for resources, (3) increased maternal survival or lifetime reproductive success for either mother or father by elimination of an ill-timed, handicapped, or supernumerary infant, and, finally, (4) increased access for individuals of one sex for reproductive investment by the other sex at the expense of same-sex competitors. Predicted attributes of the perpetrators (such as sex and degree of relatedness to the infant), attributes of the victim (i.e., age and vulnerability), as well as schedule of gain, vary for each class. Under some circumstances, individuals commit infanticide which does not result in any prospect for gain; such instances are considered nonadaptive or \xe2\x80\x9cpathological.\xe2\x80\x9d In those cases where infanticide does on the average increase fitness, selection pressures favoring it have arisen as a result of the extensive and time-consuming investment involved in production of young, and the extreme vulnerability that characterizes infancy in many animals.The scattered but nevertheless extensive occurrence of infanticide among primates raises the question of inter-specific variation. Factors such as seasonality in breeding, cooperation between individuals in defense of infants, marginal habitats, and low intrinsic rates of natural increase may outweigh other pressures, such as short male tenure lengths, which select for infanticide. Within the same species, infanticide may occur in some areas but not others, as evidenced by the variable expression of infanticidal behavior among Hanuman langurs. At present, the most obvious factor influencing facultative expression of the infanticidal trait is population density.Where it occurs, sexually selected infanticide is a significant cause of mortality. As such, it has important implications for the evolution of behavior, particularly for patterns of association between males and females, for female reproductive physiology, and for the patterning of sexual receptivity by females. It is hypothesized that the threat posed by infanticide is one of several pressures selecting for a shift among higher primates away from strictly cyclical estrous receptivity towards socially determined or situation-dependent receptivity.'

Title: 'A General Account of the Fauna and Flora of Mangrove Swamps and Forests in the Indo-West-Pacific Region'
Author: 'William'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065288108604381
Abstract: 'Publisher SummaryMangroves are trees or bushes growing between the level of high water of spring tides and a level close to but above mean sea-level. Very few species of mangrove are deep rooted, or have persistent tap roots. Almost all are shallow rooted but the root systems are often extensive and may cover a wide area. Rhizophoraceous trees have seedlings with a long radicle which would seem well suited to develop into a tap root, but as soon as the seedling becomes established in the mud the radicle develops little further. Trees of Avicennia and of Sonneratia develop several different kinds of roots. The main rooting system consists of large cable roots which give off anchoring roots downwards and aerial roots or pneumatophores upwards. These pneumatophores in their turn produce a large number of nutritive roots which penetrate the mineral-rich subsurface layers of the soil. The land animals found in mangrove forests include roosting flocks of fruit bats, fishing and insectivorous birds, and many insects are conspicuous. Of the marine animals, crabs and molluscs live permanently in the forest, and prawns and fishes come in on the tide to feed on the apparently abundant nutriment provided by the mangrove soils. In South East Asia man uses mangrove areas for the establishment of ponds for the culture of fish and prawns, and for timber.'
