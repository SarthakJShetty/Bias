Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Range maps used by IUCN for threat assessment are inaccurate and mostly overestimated.\xe2\x80\xa2Citizen science, georeferenced ecological data, and distribution modeling allow accurate range estimates.\xe2\x80\xa2We found the ranges of 17 of 18 Western Ghats endemic bird species overestimated.\xe2\x80\xa2We also found 10 of those species requiring an uplisting of their IUCN threat status.\xe2\x80\xa2Methods used here to refine range estimates have conservation implications for taxa worldwide.AbstractThe validity of the threat status assigned to a species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List relies heavily on the accuracy of the geographic range size estimate for that species. Range maps used to assess threat status often contain large areas of unsuitable habitat, thereby overestimating range and underestimating threat. In this study, we assessed 18 endemic birds of the Western Ghats to test the accuracy of the geographic range sizes used by the IUCN for their threat assessment. Using independently reviewed data from the world's largest citizen science database (eBird) within a species distribution modeling framework, our results show that: (a) geographic ranges have been vastly overestimated by IUCN for 17 of the 18 endemic bird species; (b) range maps used by IUCN contain large areas of unsuitable habitat, and (c) ranges estimated in this study suggest provisional uplisting of IUCN threat status for at least 10 of the 18 species based on area metrics used by the IUCN for threat assessment. Since global range size is an important parameter for assigning IUCN threat status, citizen science datasets, high resolution and freely available geo-referenced ecological data, and the latest species distribution modeling techniques should be used to estimate and track changes in range extent whenever possible. The methods used here to significantly revise range estimates have important conservation management implications not only for endemic birds in the Western Ghats, but for vertebrate and invertebrate taxa worldwide.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (71KB)Download full-size image"

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Niche models were used to quantify the impact of climate change on Nilgiri Tahr.\xe2\x80\xa2Suitable habitat for Tahr is expected to decrease drastically in future.\xe2\x80\xa2Small populations may face extinction debts due to the effect of climate change.\xe2\x80\xa2Monitoring, maintaining, and improving current habitat quality is recommended.AbstractLarge mammals are declining globally due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Climate change is one of the factors known to alter the range of several mammalian species. An early understanding of the effect of climate change on species distributions can provide critical information for conservation planning. Nilgiritragus hylocrius (Nilgiri Tahr) is an endangered ungulate that is restricted to the montane grasslands of the Western Ghats, India. Currently, the Nilgiri Tahr is restricted to a fraction of its former range and is also prone to risks due to several ongoing anthropogenic pressures. However, the impact of global climate change on this emblematic species has seldom been estimated. The goal of our study was to use ecological niche models to quantify the effect of climate change on the habitats of Nilgiri Tahr. Using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm, we modelled the potential distribution of Nilgiri Tahr in its native range. The models were developed under the current climatic conditions and then projected onto two future climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and for three different time frames in the future (years 2030, 2050 and 2080). We identified that most of the climatically suitable habitats of Nilgiri Tahr would become unsuitable when global warming intensifies. Our models predicted a complete loss of suitable habitats in many existing protected areas in the Western Ghats. We use insights provided by our modeling results to propose conservation management plans to increase the likelihood of persistence of Nilgiri Tahr in the Western Ghats.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (110KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Climate change will impact the distribution of many species.\xe2\x80\xa2Impact of climate change on distribution of 5 species of Myristicaceae predicted.\xe2\x80\xa2The model predicted an overall increase in the suitable habitats for most species.\xe2\x80\xa2Shift in the habitat range of few swampy species in response to climate change.\xe2\x80\xa2Swampy species need urgent attention.AbstractClimate change has the potential to have significant influence on distribution of many species and alter ecosystems. With the current estimates of rate of projected environmental change for the 21st century, urgent adaptation and mitigation measures are required to slow down the impact of climate change on biodiversity. A number of studies have shown that recent human-induced environmental changes have already triggered species range shifts, changes in phenology and species extinctions. However, accurate projections of species responses to future climate change are more difficult to ascertain. In recent years, a number of modeling tools are being used to predict the consequences of climate change on the distribution of species and also identify possible ecological niche of a species under different climate change scenarios.In this paper, using the distribution data of the species, we have attempted to (a) identify the current geographical distribution of five species of the family Myristicaceae and predict the possible sites of occurrence of these species in the Western Ghats, India using the niche modeling tools and (b) predict the impact of climate change on the potential distribution of these species for two scenarios (A1B and A2A). All the five species selected for the study are distributed in the Western Ghats with higher densities in the Central Western Ghats. The model predicted an overall increase in the suitable habitats for the non-swampy species. However, there is a shift in the habitat range of these species in response to climate change. Gymnocranthera canarica and Myristica fatua, which are obligate swampy species, tend to be affected in changing climate. For both these species, the overall habitat is reduced due to climate change. These species already have restricted habitat and therefore climate change could pose a serious threat for their future survival. Predicting how species distribution will change in the wake of future global climate change is important to develop effective conservation strategies for these species, which inhabit fragile ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Assessed land use and temperature dynamics during 1973\xe2\x80\x932016 in protected areas.\xe2\x80\xa2The evergreen forest cover has declined from 33 to 27% in Kudremukh National Park.\xe2\x80\xa2Similar trend of 14% deciduous forest decline in Bandipur Tiger Reserve.\xe2\x80\xa2Simulation for 2026 shows further increase in plantations and decimation of forests.AbstractForest ecosystems sustain biota on the earth as they are habitat to diverse biotic species, arrests soil erosion, play a crucial role in water cycle, sequester carbon, and helps in mitigating the impacts of global warming. Large scale land use land cover (LULC) change leading to deforestation is one of the drivers of global climate changes and alteration of biogeochemical cycles with significant consequences in ecosystem services and biodiversity. This has necessitated the investigation of LULC by mapping, monitoring and modelling spatio-temporal patterns and evaluating these in the context of human-environment interactions. The current work investigates LULC changes with temperature dynamics of select protected areas in Western Ghats. The land use analyses reveal changes in the forest cover across Kudremukh National Park (KNP), Rajiv Gandhi Tiger Reserve (RTR), Bandipur Tiger Reserve (BTR). KNP region has lost evergreen forest cover during 1973\xe2\x80\x932016 from 33.46 to 27.22%, while BTR lost deciduous cover from 61.69 to 47.3% due to mining, horticulture plantations, human habitations, etc. The LST increase has impacted regeneration of species with the induced water stress, etc. CA-Markov modelling was used for forecasting the likely land uses in 2026 and validation was done through Kappa indices. Results highlight decline of evergreen cover in KNP (9%) and deciduous cover in RTR (2%) followed by BTR (3%) with further expansion of plantations, which will impact biodiversity, hydrology and ecology. Insights of LULC dynamics help natural resource managers in evolving appropriate strategies to ensure conservation of threatened biota in Western Ghats.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (494KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Predictors were assessed using presence-only and bootstrap.\xe2\x80\xa2Climate change significantly decline species suitable distribution.\xe2\x80\xa2Results indicated an excellent accuracy in Maxent outputs.\xe2\x80\xa2Temperature seasonality and isothermality contribute the maximum to the distribution Garcinia indica.\xe2\x80\xa2Predicted suitability and predictors contribution could help conservation planning and management.AbstractIn recent years, climate change has become a major threat and has been widely documented in the geographic distribution of many plant species. However, the impacts of climate change on the distribution of ecologically vulnerable medicinal species remain largely unknown. The identification of a suitable habitat for a species under climate change scenario is a significant step towards the mitigation of biodiversity decline. The study, therefore, aims to predict the impact of current, and future climatic scenarios on the distribution of the threatened Garcinia indica across the northern Western Ghats using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modelling. The future projections were made for the year 2050 and 2070 with all Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenario (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) using 56 species occurrence data, and 19 bioclimatic predictors from the BCC-CSM1.1 model of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change\xe2\x80\x99s (IPCC) 5th assessment. The bioclimatic variables were minimised to a smaller number of variables after a multicollinearity test, and their contributions were assessed using jackknife test. The AUC value of 0.956\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.023 indicates that the model performs with excellent accuracy. The study identified that temperature seasonality (39.5\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf3.1%), isothermality (19.2\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf1.6%), and annual precipitation (12.7\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf1.7%) would be the major influencing variables in the current and future distribution. The model predicted 10.50% (19318.7\xe2\x80\xafsq.\xe2\x80\xafkm) of the study area as moderately to very highly suitable, while 82.60% (151904\xe2\x80\xafsq.\xe2\x80\xafkm) of the study area was identified as \xe2\x80\x98unsuitable\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98very low suitable\xe2\x80\x99. Our predictions of Climate change impact on habitat suitability suggest that there will be a drastic reduction in the suitability by 5.29% and 5.69% under RCP 8.5 for 2050 and 2070, respectively.Objective and SignificancePrimary objective of this study is to identify the potential distribution of medicinally and ecologically important but threatened Garcinia indica species in the northern Western Ghats on the basis of species occurrence data and nineteen bioclimatic predictors. Using MaxEnt modelling, current and future species distribution and suitability has been predicted using the BCC-CSM1.1 and four RCP scenarios of 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5. The results also signify the bioclimatic variables contribution to the species distribution in northern Western Ghats.Finally, the results signify that the model might be an efficient tool for biodiversity protection, ecosystem management, and species re-habitation planning under future climate change scenarios.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (208KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Assigning conservation value and identifying hotspots of endemic rattan diversity in the Western Ghats, India'
Author: 'Mukta'

Abstract: 'AbstractRattans, or canes, are one of the most important non-timber forest products supporting the livelihood of many forest-dwelling communities in South and North-eastern India. Due to increased demand for rattan products, rattans have been extracted indiscriminately from the Western Ghats, a 1600-km mountain chain running parallel to the west coast of India. Extensive harvesting, loss of habitat and poor regeneration has resulted in dwindling rattan populations, necessitating an urgent attempt to conserve existing rattan resources. In this study, using niche-modelling tools, an attempt has been made to identify areas of high species richness of rattans in the Western Ghats, one of the mega-diversity regions of the world. We have also developed conservation values for 21 economically important and endemic rattans of the Western Ghats. We identified at least two to three sites of extremely high species richness outside the existing protected area network that should be prioritized for in situ conservation. This study emphasizes the need to develop strategies for the long-term conservation of rattans in the Western Ghats, India.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper presents a study of phytoliths (opal silica bodies from plants) from sediment sequences obtained from two tropical forest patches in the Western Ghats of India: a sacred grove (sequence covers last 550\xc2\xa0cal BP) and a forest patch in a plantation (sequence covers last 7500\xc2\xa0cal BP). The sites are located at mid-elevation (c. 650\xe2\x80\x931400\xc2\xa0m above sea level) in a mosaic landscape showing anthropogenic open habitats and plantations as well as some evergreen forests. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the landscape composition of grassland and forest over time in the region, grassland being invariably shaped by anthropogenic activities, particularly fire for cultivation. We identified and classified phytoliths into 34 morphotypes from five taxonomic groups: Poaceae (grasses), Cyperaceae (sedges), Arecaceae (palms), Pteridopsida (ferns) and woody dicotyledons (broad-leaved trees and shrubs). We also calculated the humidity\xe2\x80\x93aridity index (Iph). First, our results show that grasses are the most represented phytolith types in both sites, followed by broad-leaved trees and shrubs, palms, sedges, and ferns. Second, the highly variable climatic index Iph over the last 1000 years suggest that changes in phytolith percentage (e.g. broad-leaved trees) might be caused by human agro-pastoral activities, such as clearing through fires and irrigation. Prior to these human activities, the phytolith signal for early Holocene climate is congruent with the existing literature. Finally, this study compares new phytolith results with previous pollen data from the same sites. We find good agreement between these two botanical proxies throughout, thus validating our findings. We provide important evidence regarding the history of environmental change due to anthropogenic activities in the Western Ghats. This has important implications because it provides insights into how tropical forest will respond to increased intensity of human activities.'

Abstract: 'AbstractWildlife utilization in the tropics is massive, with nearly 5 million tons of bushmeat consumed by local communities. In India, a megadiversity nation, hunting\xe2\x80\x94although illegal\xe2\x80\x94is widespread among indigenous communities. However, the extent, frequency, and rationale for hunting, and factors influencing wildlife utilization are poorly known. Our study, based on 19 different indigenous communities in the Western Ghats region, revealed the utilization of 54 wild species/taxa. Although freshwater fish, herpetofauna, and small mammals were most frequently utilized, enforcement by the Forest Department was largely focused on large mammals. Gender, land ownership, number of domestic meats consumed, distance to markets, time spent hunting, and distance to hunting areas were major factors that affected wild meat utilization in the region. Although conservation needs to be focused on the most utilized groups, increasing access to domestic meats at remote settlements and integrating utilization of common, culturally prominent species can improve conservation of threatened fauna.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Light and electron microscopic study of skin of Ichthyophis tricolor and Uraeotyphlus cf. oxyurus.\xe2\x80\xa2Mucous and granular glands are reported.\xe2\x80\xa2First report on caecilians from Western Ghats, India.AbstractWe adopted light and electron microscopy to understand the structure of the skin of two species of caecilians, Ichthyophis tricolor and Uraeotyphlus cf. oxyurus, from Western Ghats of Kerala, India. The surface of the skin of these caecilians contains an irregular pattern of microridges. Oval, round and polymorphic glandular openings are randomly distributed all over the skin surface. Most of the openings are funnel shaped. The epithelial cells along the rim of the opening descend into the tunnel of the duct. A few glandular openings protrude slightly above the epithelium of the duct. The skin is formed of epidermis and dermis. Small flat disk-like dermal scales, composed of a basal plate of several layers of unmineralized collagen fibers topped with a discontinuous layer of mineralized globular squamulae, are lodged in pouches in the transverse ridges of the skin. Each pouch contains 1\xe2\x80\x934 scales, which might differ in size. The scales are almost similar between species, yet the difference can be useful in distinguishing between the two species. Flask cells and Merkel cells are present in the epidermis. Two types of glands, mucous and granular, are present in the dermis. The mucous glands are densely packed with mucous vesicles. Darkly stained mucous producing cells are located around the periphery of the gland. Secretory mucous vesicles differ in their organization and distribution. The granular glands are located perpendicular to the skin surface. The granule producing cells of the gland are located near the periphery. There are differently stained spherical secretory granules of various sizes in the cytoplasm. Thus, the use of different microscopic techniques contributed fascinatingly to the first ever understanding of organization of the skin of two selected caecilian species from Western Ghats, revealing certain features to differ between them.'

Abstract: 'AbstractSeven sampling sites in each of three biomes (Western Ghats, foothills of Western Ghats and west coast) of south-western India were investigated to study the distribution, abundance and ecology of pill millipedes (Arthrosphaera)and associated fauna in relation to edaphic features. Abundance and biomass of Arthrosphaera and other millipedes were the highest in Western Ghats, while earthworms were in foothills. Arthrosphaera magna and Arthrosphaera spp. were common in Western Ghats and foothills respectively, while no Arthrosphaera were found in the west coast. None of the sampling sites consisted of more than one species of Arthrosphaera. Biomass of Arthrosphaera, other millipedes and earthworms significantly differed in Western Ghats (P =9.48 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x927) and foothills (P =1.35 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x928), as did the biomass of species of Arthrosphaera (P =2.76 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x927) between Western Ghats and foothills. Correlation analysis revealed that biomass of Arthrosphaera was significantly (P =0.01, r =0.45) correlated with soil organic carbon rather than other edaphic features (pH, phosphate, calcium and magnesium). Distribution pattern, abundance, biomass and ecology of Arthrosphaera of Western Ghats in relation to soil qualities were compared with millipedes of other regions of the world.'

The aim of the present study was to conduct regular entomological surveillance and to determine the relative abundance of tree hole mosquito species in Tamilnadu, India. In addition to this, the impact of weather-conditions on tree hole mosquito population were evaluated between June, 2014 and May, 2015. Six hills ranges viz., Anaimalai hills, Kodaikanal hills, Sitheri hills, Kolli hills, Yercaud hills, and Megamalai were selected, the immatures collected from tree holes by the help of suction tube. Collections were made at dusk and dawn at randomly selected 15 different tree species. The collected samples were stored and morphologically identified to species level in the laboratory. Mosquito diversity was calculated by Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s and Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Weiner diversity indicies with spatial and temporal aspects. Over 2642 mosquitoes comprising the primary vectors of dengue, chickungunya, malaria, filariasis were identified. Other species collected from the fifteen sites in each hill during the study included Christophersiomyia annularis, Christophersiomyia thomsoni, Downsiomyia albolateralis, Downsiomyia nivea and Toxorhynchites splendens, etc. Study revealed high species diversity and relative density associated with different study sites. Based on the Shannon diversity index high number of species was recorded with Aedes pseudoalbopicta (0.0829) followed by Ae. aegypti (0.0805) and least species was recorded as Anopheles elegans (0.0059). The distribution of the primary vectors of DF along the high occurrence was evident with most study sites representing proportions of this vector population. This showed the high risk level associated with the livestock movement in amplification and circulation of the virus during the outbreaks. The findings of this study, therefore, demonstrated the potential vulnerability of nomadic communities to infection by arboviral diseases transmitted by mosquito vectors.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Sacred forest groves are protected historically through cultural practices.\xe2\x80\xa2We show that some sacred groves are regenerated patches of forest.\xe2\x80\xa2The social\xe2\x80\x93ecological system of sacred forest groves changes over time.\xe2\x80\xa2Various cultural, social, political and ecological drivers are identified.\xe2\x80\xa2We provide insights for modern-day forest restoration and management.AbstractSacred forest groves in the Western Ghats of India are small fragments of tropical forest that have received protection due to religious beliefs and cultural practices. These forest fragments are an example of community-based conservation and they serve as refugia for many forest-dwelling species in otherwise highly anthropogenic tropical forest-agriculture landscapes of the Indian Western Ghats. Many of these sacred forest groves are considered ancient woodlands, but there is very little information on their origins. For instance: How old are these sacred groves? Are they relics of forest that was once continuous or are they patches of regenerated vegetation? How do changes in the surrounding landscape influence the vegetation in these groves? Based on palaeoecological reconstruction in two such sacred forest groves, we determined the age of these forest fragments. Both reconstructions indicate transition from non-forest open landscape to tree-covered landscape at these sites. These finding from two sacred groves challenge the common perception that sacred forest groves are remnants of once-continuous forest; instead, some sacred groves such as those studied might be regenerated forest patches that are approximately 400\xc2\xa0years old. This further raises a number of questions about the drivers of reforestation in these groves. What were the social and cultural circumstances which led to the recovery of forest within these patches? How did land tenure influence forest recovery? What role did religious beliefs play in forest restoration? Using Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s (1956) framework of \xe2\x80\x98cultural revitalization\xe2\x80\x99 and based on historical literature and palaeoecological analysis of the two sacred groves, this paper examines the drivers of reforestation in the Western Ghats of India.

Title: 'Sustaining biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes in the Western Ghats: Remnant forests matter'
Author: 'M.O.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320710000145
Abstract: 'AbstractHuman-modified tropical landscapes under semi-natural or agro-ecosystems often harbor biodiversity of significant conservation value. In the Western Ghats of India, these ecosystems also provide connectivity between protected areas and other remnant forests. We investigated the conservation value of these landscapes and agro-ecosystems using results from 35 studies covering 14 taxonomic groups. Large, conspicuous taxonomic groups and tree-covered land-use types have received much focus in this area of research in the Western Ghats. We computed a response ratio defined as the log ratio of species richness in human land use to species richness in forest control site from 17 studies. In a meta-analysis, we investigated variation of this ratio across studies with respect to three variables: taxonomic group, the land-use type sampled and the extent of forest cover within the study landscape. Higher forest cover within the landscape emerged as a major positive influence on biodiversity in human-modified landscapes for vertebrates and vegetation while no patterns emerged for invertebrates. Our results suggest that loss of remnant forest patches from these landscapes is likely to reduce biodiversity within agro-ecosystems and exacerbate overall biodiversity loss across the Western Ghats. Conservation of these remnant forest patches through protection and restoration of habitat and connectivity to larger forest patches needs to be prioritized. In the densely populated Western Ghats, this can only be achieved by building partnerships with local land owners and stakeholders through innovative land-use policy and incentive schemes for conservation.'

The immature mosquitoes in stream pools were collected from stream substrates of bedrock pool, boulder cavity and sand puddle. The collected larvae and pupae were reared and identified. In total, 16 species from four genera of mosquitoes were collected. The mosquito species from Culex and Anopheles were predominantly occurred. The bedrock pool had the highest diversity and abundance of mosquitoes. The statistical analyses showed that the substrate specificity and the seasons were positively related to the distribution of mosquitoes rather than spatial pattern.

Title: 'Flow Regionalization Under Limited Data Availability \xe2\x80\x93 Application of IHACRES in the Western Ghats\xe2\x98\x86'

Abstract: 'AbstractLong-term measurements of river stream flow are essential for numerous applications in water resources. In many parts of the world, rivers remain ungauged; stream flow prediction for such ungauged catchment requires information transfer from gauged catchments that are perceived to be hydrologically similar to them. Prediction of stream flows at ungauged catchments is typically performed through the transfer of hydrologic information (e.g., model parameters, hydrologic indices, stream flow values) from gauged to ungauged catchments. This procedure is commonly referred to as regionalization. Hydrologic models have been used extensively for the purpose of transfer of hydrologic model parameters from gauged to ungauged catchments and these models include HBV, IHACRES and PDM.In the present study, for the purpose of regionalisation, a lumped conceptual model namely, IHACRES has been used. IHACRES is a parsimonious model having six numbers of parameters and requires small data input. The model parameters are used to characterise the daily stream flow of the catchment and are related to the landscape attributes of the catchments. Further, as an offshoot, IHACRES provides for base-flow separation and development of unit hydrograph, which becomes an input in other hydrological works.In the current paper, the model IHACRES is applied at daily time step to six catchments (Malathi, Hemavathi, Lakshmanthirtha, Yetthinahole, Kadumanehalla and Kumaradhara) in the region of Western Ghats, Karnataka. IHACRES, being parsimonious, requires precipitation and temperature as the only data-input. Information is compiled for physical catchment descriptors using the elevation map of the area (DEM) and relationships are developed between the parameters and the descriptors. These relationships are validated by modelling daily stream flow of a gauged catchment (Nethravathi). This work proves that as an alternative model, IHACRES does well in the domain of flow regionalization with least data inputs.'

Title: 'Pestalotiopsis species occur as generalist endophytes in trees of Western Ghats forests of southern India'
Author: 'M. Sudhakara'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1754504816301052
Abstract: 'AbstractOne hundred tree species from 4 different forest types (25 from each forest) of the Western Ghats were studied for the occurrence of Pestalotiopsis as foliar endophytes. Morphological and ITS sequence study confirmed that species of Pestalotiopsis are generalist endophytes infecting taxonomically unrelated tree hosts. Furthermore, a single tree species harboured more than one species of this endophyte. Considering the leaf as a microhabitat, such a wide ecological amplitude of Pestalotiopsis as a foliar endophyte appears to be the result of accumulation of a suite of traits which are governed by the environment. This could be one of the reasons for the existence of generalist fungi among endophytes transcending host taxonomic and habitat restrictions.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Tribal people in the south Indian area of Attappady have become progressively marginalised over the past decades.\xe2\x80\xa2Planned adaptation is important for coping but did not succeed in creating capacities that incentivise autonomous adaptation.\xe2\x80\xa2Prevalent adaptation strategies are ill-attuned to the complex socio-ecological and cultural matrix of Attappady.\xe2\x80\xa2Root causes of vulnerability remain persistent, posing challenges for future adaptation trajectories.AbstractClimate change adaptation has become an important aspect of research and policy agendas at different scales \xe2\x80\x93 globally, nationally and locally. One stream of thought relates to the thematic area of barriers or challenges that adaptation faces. This article explores local adaptation trajectories and challenges in a tribal development block in south India. Through the lens of key livelihood strategies pursued in the block \xe2\x80\x93 namely income from development interventions, migration and on-farm strategies \xe2\x80\x93 it explores the challenges and factors that contribute or have contributed, to impeding successful adaptation outcomes in Attappady. The article argues that development interventions (i.e planned adaptations) have not succeeded in addressing structural causes of vulnerability; they have, however, provided an important coping mechanism. Migration is a socially and culturally differentiated phenomenon and is not a viable diversification option for the most vulnerable population segments in Attappady. Finally, it is found that recent on-farm adaptation strategies present a case of maladaptation that promote marginalisation and are ill-suited to the local ecological and cultural landscape.'

Abstract: 'AbstractBiodiversity conservation in forested landscapes outside protected areas is important to sustain populations of species with restricted ranges. However, such habitats face many anthropogenic threats, including logging, extraction of firewood and leaf-litter for mulch in plantations. In this study, we determined the effects of forest degradation on amphibians and reptiles in forests outside protected areas by measuring their species richness and community composition across a disturbance gradient from near pristine to highly degraded forests in Agumbe, Western Ghats, India. Twenty-one strip 15\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0150\xc2\xa0m transects were laid across the disturbance gradient and diurnal visual encounter surveys were conducted. Sampling was repeated three times per transect covering the dry, intermediate and wet seasons. Amphibian and reptile communities were affected by the decrease in canopy cover and leaf litter volume, respectively. Our results indicate that the collection of firewood and leaf-litter can severely affect amphibian and reptile populations. Structured conservation planning outside of protected areas is therefore imperative.'

Title: 'Altered stand structure and tree allometry reduce carbon storage in evergreen forest fragments in India\xe2\x80\x99s Western Ghats'
Author: 'Anand M.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We assessed fragmentation effects on forest structure, composition and carbon storage.\xe2\x80\xa2More open, shorter and softer wooded forest fragments store 40% less carbon.\xe2\x80\xa2Within species, trees in fragments are shorter for any given diameter.AbstractTropical forests are among the largest terrestrial reservoirs of carbon, and play an important role in regulating global climate. However, as a result of historic and ongoing deforestation, carbon storage in this biome is increasingly dependent on forests that are fragmented and used by humans, with considerable uncertainty about how such disturbance alters carbon storage potential and cycling. Here, we evaluate differences in above-ground carbon stocks between fragmented and contiguous evergreen forests in the central Western Ghats, India. We also assess differences in the structure, tree allometry and functional composition of forest stands between contiguous and fragmented forests, and explore how these differences influence carbon storage in fragmented forests. Relatively large, well-protected forest fragments currently store 40% less carbon per hectare above ground than contiguous forests. These differences in carbon are related to (i) lower tree density and basal area in fragments, (ii) lower average stand height in fragments, and (iii) compositional shifts favoring species with lower wood densities. Reduced stand height in fragments was associated with intra-specific variation in tree allometry, with trees in fragments being relatively shorter at any given diameter than conspecifics in contiguous forests. Further, the relatively skewed distribution of carbon storage within a few large trees in current-day fragments is added cause for concern: carbon stocks in fragments are likely to decline further in the future, following the eventual death of large trees. Active management and restoration to mitigate ecologically driven changes in habitat structure and species composition might be as important as improved management of resource use and protection from exploitation in order to sustain carbon storage ecosystem services provided by these tropical forest fragments.'

Title: 'The rain\xe2\x80\x93runoff response of tropical humid forest ecosystems to use and reforestation in the Western Ghats of India'
Author: 'Jagdish'

Abstract: 'SummaryThe effects of forest degradation and use and establishment of tree-plantations on degraded or modified forest ecosystems at multi-decadal time-scales using tree-plantations on the streamflow response are less studied in the humid tropics when compared to deforestation and forest conversion to agriculture. In the Western Ghats of India (Uttar Kannada, Karnataka State), a previous soil hydraulic conductivity survey linked with rain IDF (intensity\xe2\x80\x93duration\xe2\x80\x93frequency) had suggested a greater occurrence of infiltration-excess overland within the degraded forest and reforested areas and thus potentially higher streamflow (Bonell et al., 2010). We further tested these predictions in Uttar Kannada by establishing experimental basins ranging from 7 to 23\xc2\xa0ha across three ecosystems, (1) remnant tropical evergreen Forest (NF), (2) heavily-used former evergreen forest which now has been converted to tree savanna, known as degraded forest (DF) and (3) exotic Acacia plantations (AC, Acacia auriculiformis) on degraded former forest land. In total, 11 basins were instrumented (3 NF, 4 AC and 4 DF) in two geomorphological zones, i.e., Coastal and Up-Ghat (Malnaad) and at three sites (one Coastal, two Up-Ghat). The rainfall\xe2\x80\x93streamflow observations collected (at daily and also at a 36\xc2\xa0min time resolutions in the Coastal basins) over a 2\xe2\x80\x933\xc2\xa0year period (2003\xe2\x80\x932005) were analysed.In both the Coastal and Up-Ghat basins, the double mass curves showed during the rainy season a consistent trend in favour of more proportion of streamflow in the rank order DF\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0AC\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0NF. These double mass curves provide strong evidence that overland flow is progressively becomes a more dominant stormflow pathway. Across all sites, NF converted 28.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa06.41stdev% of rainfall into total streamflow in comparison to 32.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa06.97stdev% in AC and 45.3\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa09.61stdev% in DF.Further support for the above trends emerges from the quickflow ratio QF/Q for the Coastal basins. There are much higher values for both the DF and AC land covers, and their rank order DF\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0AC\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0NF. The quickflow response ratio QF/P is also the highest for the DF basin, and along with the QF/Q ratio, can exceed 90%. The corresponding delayed flow response ratios, QD/P clearly show the largest QD yields as a proportion of event precipitation from the Forest (NF1). The application of linear model supported these differences (e.g. 10\xe2\x80\x9336% difference between NF and DF, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001) in the storm hydrologic response of the Coastal basins. The exception was QF/P where there was a higher uncertainty connected with inter-basin mean differences. Cross-correlation plots for rain\xe2\x80\x93streamflow and corresponding lag regression models for three storm events in the Coastal basins suggested the existence of alternative stormflow pathways with multiple lags with peaks between \xe2\x88\xbc12 and 24\xc2\xa0h in NF, compared to respective bimodal peaks at \xe2\x88\xbc1 and 16\xc2\xa0h in AC and \xe2\x88\xbc1 and 12\xc2\xa0h in DF. The long time lags for NF are suggestive of deep subsurface stormflow and groundwater as the contributing sources to the storm hydrograph. The short time lags in DF and AC are indicative of overland flow and so \xe2\x80\x98memory\xe2\x80\x99 of the previous degraded land cover is retained in AC as supported by previous hydraulic conductivity data. As potential and actual evapotranspiration is likely to be depressed during the monsoon, differences in streamflow and run-off responses between land-cover types is largely attributed to differences in soil infiltration and hydrologic pathways. Enhancing infiltration and reducing run-off in managed ecosystems should be explored in the terms of the context of other ecosystem services and biodiversity.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Unique data on hydrologic effects of tropical reforestation and human-use. \xe2\x96\xba Clear evidence for the \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltration trade-off hypothesis\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x96\xba Comprehensive paper on hydrology of Western Ghats, a global biodiversity hotspot. \xe2\x96\xba Hydrologic processes across land-cover analysed using multiple approaches.'

Title: 'Chemical and Microbial Characterization of Feed and Faeces of Two Giant Pill-Millipedes from Forests in the Western Ghats of India'

Abstract: 'AbstractSoil macroinvertebrates are highly diverse and their major ecological service include breakdown of organic matter and in turn improve soil fertility and pill-millipedes are well-known for their significant role in ingestion, disintegration and decomposition of organic matter in soil. This study characterized the feed, the decomposing leaf litter of coconut (Cocos nucifera), and faeces of two endemic giant pill-millipedes Arthrosphaera disticta and A. fumosa collected from forests of the Western Ghats of India based on chemical features and microbial profile. In both millipedes, electric conductivity and total phosphorus were significantly increased in faeces, while the crude protein, organic carbon, total nitrogen and total phenolics were significantly decreased, as compared to those in feed. Heterotrophic bacteria, actinomycetes, rhizobia and phosphate-solubilizing bacteria were significantly higher in faeces than in feed, while filamentous fungi and yeast substantially decreased in faces compared to feed in both the millipedes. Spectrum of fatty acid methyl esters was considerably different between feed and faeces of both the millipedes. The total saturated fatty acids were higher than the total unsaturated fatty acids in feed as well as faeces, while the ratio of unsaturated/saturated fatty acids decreased from feed to faeces. Dodecanoic and tetradecanoic acids in A. disticta and octadecanoic acid in A. fumosa significantly increased, while (9Z)-octadec-9-enoic and (9E,12E)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic acids in A. disticta and hexadecanoic, tetracosanoic and (9E,12E)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic acids in A. fumosa significantly decreased in faeces compared to feed, indicating millipede-dependent changes in fatty acids. Icosanoic acid was present in faeces of both the millipedes, and hexadec-9-enoic acid was confined to faeces of A disticta, while pentadecanoic, heneicosanoic, (9Z,12Z,15Z)-9,12,15-octadecatrienoic and eicosenoic acids were confined to faeces of A. fumosa. Pill-millipedes enrich the soil quality by leaf litter conditioning in their gut through specific microbial communities. Fingerprinting of fatty acid methyl esters in faeces of these millipedes reflected the activity of specific microbial population in their guts.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe present paper reports on palynology and pollination ecology of eight taxa of Amorphophallus from North Western Ghats (NWGS) and Konkan region of India. Out of ten known pollen exine ornamentations of the genus, six are represented \xe2\x80\x93 psilate, striate, fossulate, verrucate, scabrate and the new type \xe2\x80\x98pseudofossulate\xe2\x80\x99 of Amorphophallus commutatus var. wayanadensis. These diverse pollen exine ornamentations can be utilized as an important taxonomic tool to distinguish taxa and also to resolve taxonomic problems (A. commutatus complex). The pollen of all eight taxa had retained their sculptured surface (exine ornamenatation type) after acetolysis. This clearly demonstrates that these taxa do not show susceptibility to the conventional acetolysis technique as reported earlier. The present study also highlights the importance of pollen surface morphology concerning phytogeography of the genus.Observation of pollination ecology of the studied Amorphophallus taxa reveals that all are mostly visited by beetles (Bostrichidae, Cetoniidae, Hybosoridae, Lyctidae, Nitidulidae, Rutelinae, Scarabaeidae, Staphylinidae), followed by flies (Drosophilidae, Muscidae), bees (Apidae: Trigone), ants (Formicidae, Dolichoderinae) and cockroaches (Blaberidae/Panesthiinae). The beetle families Bostrichidae, Lyctidae and Rutelinae, ant families Formicidae and Dolichoderinae and the cockroach family Blaberidae/Panesthiinae are for the first time reported as visitors in the genus Amorphophallus. Most of the taxa display features characteristic of cantharophily (beetle pollination) except A. commutatus var. commutatus and A. commutatus var. wayanadensis, where Trigona bees are the actual pollinators. The beetles (Cetoniidae, Nitidulidae, Scarabaeidae) and bees (Apidae: Trigona) are the real pollinators for the Amorphophallus species of NWGS and Konkan while rest of the insects are mere visitors for alimentary/food resources (staminode flowers, stigmatic fluid, pollen, appendix surface, appendix exudates) and using the inflorescences as mating and egg laying sites. Species belonging to the section Rhaphiophallus (Amorphophallus konkanensis and Amorphophallus sylvaticus) are pollinated by Epuraea \xe2\x80\x93 Haptoncurina sp. (Nitidulidae) beetles only. Generally, the species of Amorphophallus in NWGS and Konkan region with short flowering peduncle are always pollinated by dung beetles or scarabs while species bearing a long flowering peduncle are usually pollinated by Epuraea \xe2\x80\x93 Haptoncurina sp. (Nitidulidae) beetles and Trigona bees. Based on the comparative observations, five different phases of insect trapping in Amorphophallus taxa are characterized, focusing on the intricacies of pollination strategies of various pollinators.'

Abstract: 'AbstractTogether, Indian plus Seychelles caeciliid caecilian amphibians (Gymnophiona) constitute approximately 10% of the extant species of this order. A molecular phylogenetic analysis of all but one (or two) nominal species (16, in five genera) is presented based on mitochondrial (12S, 16S, cytb, cox1) and nuclear (RAG1) sequence data. Results strongly support monophyly of both Seychelles and peninsular Indian caeciliids, and their sister-group status. Within the Indian caeciliids, Indotyphlus and Gegeneophis are monophyletic sister genera. The phylogenetic position of Gegeneophis ramaswamii, Gegeneophis seshachari, and Gegeneophis carnosus are not well resolved, but all lie outside a well-supported clade of most northern Western Ghats Gegeneophis (madhavai, mhadeiensis, goaensis, danieli/nadkarnii). Most nominal species of Indian caeciliid are diagnosed by robust haplotype clades, though the systematics of G. carnosus-like forms in northern Kerala and southern Karnataka requires substantial further investigation. For the most part, Indian caeciliid species comprise narrowly distributed, allopatric taxa with low genetic diversity. Much greater geographic genetic diversity exists among populations referred to G. seshachari, such that some populations likely represent undescribed species. This, the first phylogenetic analysis of Indian caeciliids, generally provides additional support for recent increases in described species (eight since 1999), and a framework for ongoing taxonomic revision.Graphical abstractDownload full-size imageHighlights\xe2\x96\xba Caeciliid caecilians of the Seychelles and peninsular India are monophyletic sister taxa. \xe2\x96\xba The Western Ghats Gegeneophis and Indotyphlus are monophyletic sister taxa. \xe2\x96\xba Most northern Western Ghats Gegeneophis comprise a clade. \xe2\x96\xba Most Western Ghats species comprise robust, geographically restricted monophyla. \xe2\x96\xba Genetic data indicate areas for taxonomic revision, including potential new species.'

Abstract: "AbstractObjectiveTo study the diversity and distribution of mosquitoes in Western Ghats of Coimbatore and Nilgiris District, Tamilnadu, India.MethodsRandom collections were carried out during August-2013 to July-2014 in cesspits, animal footprints, rock holes, tree holes, drainages at study areas of Marudhamalai, Valparai, Mettupalayam in Coimbatore District and Dhottapeta, Coonoor, Gudalur in Nilgiris District of Tamilnadu, India by using suction tube and kerosene pump. Mosquitoes were identified by standard entomological procedures.ResultsA total of 1 018 mosquitoes (larvae and pupae) were collected from all over the study areas comprising 6 genera and 23 species. They are, Culex mimulus, Culex pseudovishnui, Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex vishnui, Culex khazani, Culex uniformis, Heizmannia chandi, Heizmannia grenii, Heizmannia indica, Oclerotatus anureostriatus, Oclerotatus albotaeniatis, Oclerotatus deccanus, Oclerotatus gubernatoris, Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, Aedes edwardsi, Aedes krombeini, Toxorhynchites minimus, Toxorhynchites splendens, Anopheles aitkenii, Anopheles barbirostris, Anopheles culiciformis and Anopheles maculatus. Shannon-Weaver diversity index, Margalef's index of richness and Simpsons dominance index was also studied. From 6 sites, the highest mosquitoes were collected from Marudhamalai (309) and the least mosquitoes were collected in Mettupalayam (68). The study determined whether physicochemical characteristics differ between habitats with high and low presence of mosquito larvae. Based on Margalef's index of richness (Dmg), the highest values were present in Mettupalayam (5.214) study area and the lowest in Marudhamalai (3.837). It can be concluded from Shanon-Weaver index of diversity that, the highest values were present in Mettupalayam (2.947) and the least value were in Gudalur (2.410) during the study period.ConclusionsIn areas with reservoirs of disease, mosquito abundance information can help to identify the areas at higher risk of disease transmission. The study identifies mosquito species density and diversity of culicine and anopheline larvae. Hence, this research contribution has more significance for basic biological research and developing control strategies for vector borne diseases."

Abstract: 'SummaryAn understanding of the soil moisture variability is necessary to characterize the linkages between a region\xe2\x80\x99s hydrology, ecology and physiography. In the changing land use scenario of Western Ghats, India, where deforestation along with extensive afforestation with exotic species is being undertaken, there is an urgent need to evaluate the impacts of these changes on regional hydrology. The objectives of the present study were: (a) to understand spatio-temporal variability of soil water potential and soil moisture content under different land covers in the humid tropical Western Ghats region and (b) to evaluate differences if any in spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture content as influenced by nature of land cover. To this end, experimental watersheds located in the Western Ghats of Uttara Kannada District, Karnataka State, India, were established for monitoring of soil moisture. These watersheds possessed homogenous land covers of acacia plantation, natural forest and degraded forest. In addition to the measurements of hydro-meteorological parameters, soil matric potential measurements were made at four locations in each watershed at 50\xc2\xa0cm, 100\xc2\xa0cm and 150\xc2\xa0cm depths at weekly time intervals during the period October 2004\xe2\x80\x93December 2008.Soil moisture contents derived from potential measurements collected were analyzed to characterize the spatial and temporal variations across the three land covers. The results of ANOVA (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01, LSD) test indicated that there was no significant change in the mean soil moisture across land covers. However, significant differences in soil moisture with depth were observed under forested watershed, whereas no such changes with depth were noticed under acacia and degraded land covers. Also, relationships between soil moisture at different depths were evaluated using correlation analysis and multiple linear regression models for prediction of soil moisture from climatic variables and antecedent moisture condition were developed and tested. A regression model relating near-surface soil moisture (50\xc2\xa0cm) with profile soil moisture content was developed which may prove useful when surface soil moisture contents derived from satellite remote sensing are available. Overall results of this study indicate that while the nature of land cover has an influence on the spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture, other variables related to topography may have a more dominant effect.Research highlights\xe2\x96\xba Monitored soil moisture under natural forest, degraded forest and acacia. \xe2\x96\xba Analyzed spatial and temporal variations in weekly moisture contents. \xe2\x96\xba Mean soil moisture content was not significantly different between land covers. \xe2\x96\xba Developed and validated statistical soil moisture prediction models.'

Title: 'Biodiversity values of abandoned teak, Tectona grandis plantations in southern Western Ghats: Is there a need for management intervention?'

Abstract: 'AbstractAbandoned plantations could potentially support a large number of native tree species through succession and restore the original tree community. In order to assess the ability of abandoned teak plantations to recover through regeneration, teak stands from 29 to 80 years old were sampled for seedling and sapling density, species richness and the use by large ungulates in the southern Western Ghats using 10\xc2\xa0m circular plots. The influence of the forest-plantation edge was also studied. There was regeneration of a species-rich tree community in the understorey of abandoned teak plantations. However, regeneration was arrested, and thereby the large girth-class tree community remained species-poor. There was no significant change in the tree species richness with distance from natural forest, suggesting that the forest-plantation edge had little influence on the penetration of native tree species inside plantations. Asian elephant and Indian gaur dung densities were significantly lower in the plantations than in the forest. Indian gaur and sambar used the younger plantations intensively, and the density of their dung was negatively correlated with age of the plantation. Abandonment of mature teak stands arrested the succession of native trees. We provide evidence that abandoned teak plantations might not serve as suitable habitats for large herbivores during the dry months of the year in the region. The study highlights the need for active management of mature teak plantations inside wildlife reserves, in order to promote succession and improve the habitat for wild flora and fauna in the Western Ghats.ZusammenfassungAufgegebene Plantagen k\xc3\xb6nnten m\xc3\xb6glicherweise eine gro\xc3\x9fe Anzahl einheimischer Baumarten durch Sukzession erhalten und die urspr\xc3\xbcngliche Baumgesellschaft wieder herstellen.

Title: 'Forest resource use and perception of farmers on conservation of a usufruct forest (Soppinabetta) of Western Ghats, India'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe negative impact of anthropogenic activity on tropical forests is well documented, but the underlying factors, including socioeconomic conditions, government policy, and agricultural practices, that influence forest degradation in developing countries are poorly understood. For centuries, Soppinabetta forests (SBFs) in the Western Ghats of India have provided essential habitat for wildlife and vital organic resources (leaf litter, green foliage) for the cultivation of betel nut palms (Areca catechu) and rice paddy (Oryza sativa). Historically, betel nut farmers carefully managed resource extraction in SBFs, but recent changes in land use policy allow for unmitigated resource extraction by site dwellers, which may imperil the traditional sustainable management of SBFs. Site dwellers live on government allotted sites and primarily derive their income through the sale of forest-based products. We used SBFs as a model system to investigate the factors governing: (i) forest resource extraction, (ii) the effect of changing agricultural practices on the rate of resource extraction, and (iii) farmers\xe2\x80\x99 perception of SBFs conservation in response to changes in governmental land use policy. Results from surveys of 90 households (57 farmers and 33 site-dwellers) and the forest department indicate individual farmers collected an average of 31.09 (range 0\xe2\x80\x93125)\xc2\xa0metric\xc2\xa0tons of leaf litter and 19.11\xc2\xa0metric\xc2\xa0tons (range 0\xe2\x80\x93120) of green foliage per year. Organic resource harvesting by farmers was positively correlated with the size of betel nut plantations, size of SBFs, and number of livestock owned per household. Betel nut plantations require six times more compost than food grains cultivated in field paddies. In past one decade, 33% of field paddies have been converted into betel nut plantations, increasing the strain on SBFs for forest resources. Farmers believe that when they lose provisional ownership of SBFs, site dwellers unsustainably harvest resources and severely damage SBFs. We suggest that an inclusive, local-level, farmer-driven protection be implemented to preserve the SBF heritage system of Western Ghats.Graphical abstractDownload full-size imageHighlights\xe2\x96\xba Soppinabetta forests are farmer-managed wet evergreen forests of Sringeri in the Western Ghats. \xe2\x96\xba These forests are allotted proportionately to the betel nut plantation area of a farmer. \xe2\x96\xba Farmers collect leaf litter and green foliages from these forests to manure agricultural lands. \xe2\x96\xba Recent land use policy alienates the local control of farmers over Soppinabetta forests. \xe2\x96\xba This policy leads to unsustainable harvest of resources by landless poor peoples, competition for forest resources and degradation of the forest. \xe2\x96\xba Inclusive local-level and farmer driven protection system is required to preserve Soppinabetta forests.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Six fire frequency classes were obtained in the study area, between 1999 and 2013.\xe2\x80\xa2Fire return interval is increased to 9.28\xc2\xa0years from 3.3\xc2\xa0year (1989\xe2\x80\x932002).\xe2\x80\xa2Tree diversity decreased with increasing fire frequencies.\xe2\x80\xa2Low fire frequencies promote seedling density.\xe2\x80\xa2Stem size between 1 and 20\xc2\xa0cm dbh showed much variation across the fire classes.AbstractThis study was aimed to understand the effect of repeated fire on tropical dry deciduous forest in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR), Western Ghats. Tropical dry deciduous forests are prone to forest fire owing to high fuel load and long dry season. Fire frequency map of the study area was prepared for 15\xc2\xa0years from 1999 to 2013 using annual burn maps. Study area was stratified as B1 to B6 (one to six times burned) and compared to control (B0 \xe2\x80\x93 unburned during 1999\xe2\x80\x932013). Three plots were randomly laid in each stratum and seedlings; saplings and trees present in each plot were recorded. Species diversity indices showed increase in dominance and decrease in diversity with increasing fire frequency. Results showed that overall stem density (>1\xc2\xa0cm DBH) ranged from 576 (SD 112.69) (B1) to 236 (SD 20) individual ha\xe2\x88\x921 (B6). The basal area ranged from 36.8 (SD 2.19) m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 (B0) to 12.12 (SD 2.69) m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 (B5). Fire promoted seedling density from B0 to B2 and after that it started decreasing whereas sapling density was poor in all classes and recorded least in B6. Stem density of trees did not vary much up to B3 and started decreasing after that. Number of species decreased linearly with increasing fire frequency. In the analysis of dominant species, Tectona grandis showed a very significant mean difference in seedling, sapling and tree population whereas Terminalia cranulata did not show significant difference in mean densities of seedling, sapling or trees. It is found that fire with long interval can promote seedlings density but species diversity decreases with increasing fire frequency.'

Title: 'Prioritisation of conservation areas in the Western Ghats, India'
Author: 'Arundhati'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320706002096
Abstract: 'AbstractAreas of high conservation value were identified in the Western Ghats using a systematic conservation planning approach. Surrogates were chosen and assessed for effectiveness on the basis of spatial congruence using Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s correlations and Mantel\xe2\x80\x99s tests. The surrogates were, threatened and endemic plant and vertebrate species, unfragmented forest areas, dry forests, sub-regionally rare vegetation types, and a remotely sensed surrogate for unique evergreen ecosystems. At the scale of this analysis, amphibian richness was most highly correlated with overall threatened and endemic species richness, whereas mammals, especially wide-ranging species, were better at capturing overall animal and habitat diversity. There was a significant relationship between a remote sensing based habitat surrogate and endemic tree diversity and composition. None of the taxa or habitats served as a complete surrogate for the others. Sites were prioritised on the basis of their irreplaceability value using all five surrogates. Two alternative reserve networks are presented, one with minimal representation of surrogates, and the second with 3 occurrences of each species and 25% of each habitat type. These networks cover 8% and 29% of the region respectively. Seventy percent of the completely irreplaceable sites are outside the current protected area network. While the existing protected area network meets the minimal representation target for 88% of the species chosen in this study and all of the habitat surrogates, it is not representative with regard to amphibians, endemic tree species and small mammals. Much of the prioritised unprotected area is under reserve forests and can thus be incorporated into a wider network of conservation areas.'

Title: 'Is the Deccan Mahseer, Tor khudree (Sykes, 1839) (Pisces: Cyprinidae) fishery in the Western Ghats Hotspot sustainable? A participatory approach to stock assessment'

Abstract: 'AbstractIn this paper, we use a participatory approach, to assess the suitability of data provided by local fishers for determining the demography and harvest rates of endangered species, exploited in remotely located small-scale fisheries. We specifically focus on the Deccan Mahseer (Tor khudree) in the Western Ghats Hotspot of Peninsular India. Using catch data provided by local fishers, we assessed the dynamics of exploited populations of T. khudree from six major fishing sites having varying patterns of harvest (commercial vs. subsistence) and protection status (protected vs. non protected area). Based on annual length frequency data, growth parameters of T. khudree were worked out as L\xe2\x88\x9e\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0383.25\xe2\x80\x931202.25\xc2\xa0mm total length and K\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.12\xe2\x80\x930.23 year\xe2\x88\x921. The length frequency data of T. khudree individuals exploited from two fishing sites indicated that a high share of the catches throughout the year, are contributed by immature size classes. The total mortality coefficient (Z) was calculated to be between 0.35 year\xe2\x88\x921 and 0.95 year\xe2\x88\x921 and the fishing mortality coefficient (F) between 0.13 year and 0.8 year. The fishing mortality rate of T. khudree in Poringal Reservoir (0.8 year) may probably be one of the highest for any species of Mahseer in India, and points to the targeted indiscriminate exploitation by local fishers. Exploitation rate (E) (0.34\xe2\x80\x930.84 year\xe2\x88\x921) was higher than the expected optimal level (0.5) at all, but one fishing sites revealing that T. khudree populations are overfished in the study region. Further, a comparison of the exploitation rate at various fishing sites revealed no significant differences between commercial and subsistence harvest, as well as inside and outside protected areas. In spite of its \xe2\x80\x98endangered\xe2\x80\x99 status, T. khudree receives no protection even in Biodiversity Hotspots like the Western Ghats, and its fishery is under threat of an imminent collapse.

Abstract: 'AbstractThe diversity and distribution of fungi on naturally submerged wood from 12 high-altitude streams of the Western Ghats in India were studied by damp chamber incubation and bubble chamber incubation. The damp chamber incubation of wood samples yielded 29 fungal taxa (17 anamorphs, 11 ascomycetes, 1 basidiomycete). Acrogenospora sphaerocephala, Canalisporium sp., Dictyosporium heptasporum, Leptosphaeria ginimia, L. typharum, Massarina australiensis, Sporoschisma saccardoi, and Sporoschismopsis australiensis were the most common taxa and were widely distributed on wood in streams of the Western Ghats. The bubble chamber incubation of bark and cambium revealed 30 aquatic hyphomycetes (bark, 28; cambium, 18). Anguillospora longissima, Flagellospora curvula, F. penicillioides, and Lunulospora curvula were most common in bark as well as cambium. There was only 1 species (Helicomyces roseus) that was identified following both incubation methods, indicating that methodology influences the detection of fungal communities. It is recommended that studies on freshwater fungi should incorporate both damp incubation and bubble chamber techniques.'

Title: 'Rainfall and soil properties influence termite mound abundance and height: A case study with Odontotermes obesus (Macrotermitinae) mounds in the Indian Western Ghats forests'
Author: 'Rashmi Ramesh'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Fungus-growing termite mounds are conspicuous features of tropical soils.\xe2\x80\xa2Mounds provide an environment buffered against extremes of temperature and humidity.\xe2\x80\xa2Odontotermes obesus is major mound building termite throughout India.\xe2\x80\xa2Rainfall affects the abundance of O. obesus mounds in India.\xe2\x80\xa2Amount of clay in the surrounding topsoil determines mound soil properties.AbstractSeveral fungus-growing termite species build mounds, or termitaria, that are conspicuous features of African and Asian landscapes. Studies of the genus Macrotermes in Africa have established that their mounds provide an environment buffered against extremes of temperature and humidity, as well as protection from predators, and are correspondingly modified in composition. However, no studies are available in the specific context of the Asian continent where termite mounds are also abundant. Hence this study focused on the abundance and properties of mounds built by Odontotermes obesus in relation to rainfall and parent soil properties in southern Indian forests, in the Western Ghats area. Termite mound densities and sizes were measured in 18 forests along a rainfall gradient from 1160 to 3670\xc2\xa0mm\xc2\xa0yr\xe2\x88\x921. The C and clay contents were analyzed in soil samples collected from mounds and the surrounding topsoil. Mound numerical density was positively correlated with mound height and rainfall had a negative relationship with the abundance. Neither vegetation type nor or rainfall influenced the clay content in the mound walls but a positive linear relation was observed between the clay content in the termite mound wall and that in the surrounding topsoil environment, suggesting a rather low impact of termites on the clay content in the mound soil. The C content in mound walls depended mainly on how much clay the termites used. In conclusion, this study shows that the amount of rainfall affects the abundance of O. obesus mounds in India while the amount of clay in the surrounding topsoil determines mound soil properties.'

Abstract: 'SummaryThe reproductive phenology of 60 understorey species, including 27 endemic and 33 non-endemic species, was monitored at monthly intervals for 20 months in a mid-elevation wet forest in the Southern Western Ghats. Narrow endemic species constituted 55% of the total endemic species studied. Peak flowering was observed during the dry and post-monsoon seasons for the endemic species, while the non-endemic species flowered during the dry season. Fruiting peak was observed in the dry season for endemic species and during monsoon for non-endemics. The flowering and fruiting pattern in narrow and broad endemic species was uniform. The implications of the result for conservation are discussed.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe ecological integrity is widely discussed as a new concept by several ecologists and environmentalists. A consensus in this regard is yet to be derived for its definition. Human intervention for its developmental activities results in several environmental changes that enhance some species, ecosystem and ecological processes while at the same time brings irrecoverable damage to the Planet Earth. It is essential and crucial to focus research and scientific analysis and establish awareness and education to provide a means of distinguishing responses between improvements in quality of ecosystem and those of damages. The focus of this paper is to emphasize the organized urban planning at a macro level and the architectural design interventions at the micro level in Vijayawada where eco \xe2\x80\x93 sensitivity exists with due consideration to ecological integrity and environmental protection. The ecological dynamics of continuity indicated that hillocks of Vijayawada region are a part of Eastern Ghats. The study is to elaborate that the landscape, eco-patches and its connectivity establishes a unique corridor to strengthen ecological system and as a green corridor to Vijayawada city to fulfill the demands of the city and also to create the ecological patch connectivity to scattered Eastern Ghats especially in the Krishna-Guntur region which connects the Nallamala hills through Kondapalli hill toward Sothern side and to the Papikondalu at the northern side of Eastern Ghats. These corridors may even support environmental conservation and provides rural edge in urban context and functions as lung spaces to ease the heat island effect of urban settlement. So the explicit development controls have been derived to guide and organize at micro level so as to achieve the macro level considerations of ecological integrity.'

Title: 'Why do local households harvest forest products? A case study from the southern Western Ghats, India'
Author: 'Priya'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320708001638
Abstract: 'AbstractDeforestation in tropical countries has been partly attributed to the non-sustainable harvesting of forest biomass by local communities. We conducted a survey among 786 households in 31 agricultural villages adjoining the eastern boundary of the Kalakad\xe2\x80\x93Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, in the southern Western Ghats to see whether household wealth, social status, literacy and distance to the forest boundary influenced resource harvesting. Fuel-wood, fodder and green leaves were the major products harvested in this agricultural region. The effect of distance from the reserve boundary differed with the product harvested and its use value. Distance was a constraint for households that harvested for domestic consumption, whereas it was not significant for households that harvested for earnings. Wealth was independent of resource interest in the forest, except for the poorer lower caste households with lower levels of literacy that sold fuel-wood to earn a living. Wealthier households harvested green leaves for fertilizing their fields, and fodder harvest was related to livestock ownership. The lower cost of forest products compared to commercially available substitutes probably fuelled extraction. Forest products contributed disproportionately to household consumption as compared with household earnings. Discouraging the harvest of forest products within protected areas might be the only viable conservation strategy.'

Title: 'Bats in the Ghats: Agricultural intensification reduces functional diversity and increases trait filtering in a biodiversity hotspot in India'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Bat functional diversity was similar in shade coffee to protected forests.\xe2\x80\xa2Bat functional diversity was similar in forest fragments to protected forests.\xe2\x80\xa2Tea plantations retain far less bat functional diversity than shade grown coffee.\xe2\x80\xa2Large bats and bats with short, broad wings were filtered out in modified habitats.\xe2\x80\xa2Riparian corridors help retain bat functional diversity in a modified landscape.AbstractThe responses of bats to land-use change have been extensively studied in temperate zones and the neotropics, but little is known from the palaeotropics. Effective conservation in heavily-populated palaeotropical hotspots requires a better understanding of which bats can and cannot survive in human-modified landscapes. We used catching and acoustic transects to examine bat assemblages in the Western Ghats of India, and identify the species most sensitive to agricultural change. We quantified functional diversity and trait filtering of assemblages in forest fragments, tea and coffee plantations, and along rivers in tea plantations with and without forested corridors, compared to protected forests.Functional diversity in forest fragments and shade-grown coffee was similar to that in protected forests, but was far lower in tea plantations. Trait filtering was also strongest in tea plantations. Forested river corridors in tea plantations mitigated much of the loss of functional diversity and the trait filtering seen on rivers in tea plantations without forested corridors. The bats most vulnerable to intensive agriculture were frugivorous, large, had short broad wings, or made constant frequency echolocation calls. The last three features are characteristic of forest animal-eating species that typically take large prey, often by gleaning.Ongoing conservation work to restore forest fragments and retain native trees in coffee plantations should be highly beneficial for bats in this landscape. The maintenance of a mosaic landscape with sufficient patches of forest, shade-grown coffee and riparian corridors will help to maintain landscape wide functional diversity in an area dominated by tea plantations.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (218KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Patterns of spatiotemporal change in large mammal distribution and abundance in the southern Western Ghats, India'
Author: 'Rajeev'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320711000486
Abstract: 'AbstractLarge mammals face high risks of anthropogenic extinction owing to their larger body mass and associated life history traits. Recent worldwide mammal declines have highlighted the conservation importance of effective assessments of trends in distribution and abundance of species. Yet reliable data depicting the nature and extent of changes in population parameters is sparse, primarily due to logistical problems in covering large areas and difficulties in obtaining reliable information at large spatial scales, particularly over time. We used key informant surveys to generate detection histories for 18 species of large mammals (body mass\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa02\xc2\xa0kg) at two points in time (present and 30\xc2\xa0years ago) in the Southern subregion of the Western Ghats global biodiversity hotspot. Multiple-season occupancy models were used to assess temporal trends in occupancy, detectability and vital rates of extinction and colonization for each species. Our results show significant declines in distribution for large carnivores, the Asian elephant and endemic ungulates and primates. There is a significant decline in detectability for 16 species, which suggests a decline in their abundance. These patterns of change in distribution and abundance repeat in our assessments of spatial variation in occupancy dynamics between the three contiguous forest complexes and two human-dominated landscapes into which the southern Western Ghats has been fragmented. Extinction rates are highest in the human-dominated landscapes. Declines in abundance for several species suggest the presence of extinction debts, which may soon be repaid with imminent range contractions and subsequent species extinctions unless immediate remedial conservation measures are taken. Detection/non-detection surveys of key informants used in an occupancy modeling framework provide potential for rapid conservation status assessments of multiple species across large spatial scales over time.'

Title: 'The impact of forest use and reforestation on soil hydraulic conductivity in the Western Ghats of India: Implications for surface and sub-surface hydrology'
Author: 'M.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169410004178
Abstract: 'SummaryThere is comparatively limited information in the humid tropics on the surface and sub-surface permeability of: (i) forests which have been impacted by multi-decades of human occupancy and (ii) forestation of land in various states of degradation. Even less is known about the dominant stormflow pathways for these respective scenarios. We sampled field saturated hydraulic conductivity, K\xe2\x88\x97 at 23 sites at four depths (0\xc2\xa0m, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0166), (0.10\xc2\xa0m, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0139), 0.45\xe2\x80\x930.60\xc2\xa0m, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0117, (1.35\xe2\x80\x931.50\xc2\xa0m, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0117) under less disturbed forest (Forest), disturbed production forest of various local species (Degraded Forest) and tree-plantations (Acacia auriculiformes, 7\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0years old, Tectona grandis, \xe2\x88\xbc25\xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xa0years old, Casuarina equisetifolia, 12\xc2\xa0years old) in the Uttar Kannada district, Karnataka, India, in the Western Ghats. The sampling strategy was also undertaken across three physiographic blocks and under three main soil types. Subsequently the determined K\xe2\x88\x97 were then linked with rainfall intensity\xe2\x80\x93duration\xe2\x80\x93frequency (IDF) characteristics to infer the dominant stormflow pathways.The Degraded Forest shows an order of magnitude decline in K\xe2\x88\x97 at the surface as result of human impacts at decadal to century time scales. The lowest surface permeability is associated with the Degraded Forests over the Laterite (Eutric Nitosols and Acrisols) and Red soils (Eutric Nitosols) and infiltration-excess overland flow, IOF probably occurs. Further there is a progressive decline in K\xe2\x88\x97 with depth in these soils supporting Degraded Forests. The A. auriculiformes plantations over the Red and Lateritic soils are progressively restoring the near-surface K\xe2\x88\x97, but their K\xe2\x88\x97 still remain quite low when compared to the less disturbed forest permeability. Consequently these plantations still retain the \xe2\x80\x98memory\xe2\x80\x99 from the previous degraded state. In contrast the permeability of the Black soils (Vertisols) are relatively insensitive to T. grandis plantations and this soil group has a very low K\xe2\x88\x97, irrespective of land cover, so that IOF likely prevails. Overall, the Laterites are the most variable in K\xe2\x88\x97 when compared to the other soil groups. Thus when compared to other studies, IOF is probably more prevalent in this region. More especially so, when taking into account the marked reduction in surface K\xe2\x88\x97 during the wet season when compared to dry season measurements. In addition, we have demonstrated the potential for the \xe2\x80\x98infiltration \xe2\x80\x93 trade-off\xe2\x80\x99 hypothesis to be realized in this landscape under certain conditions of land degradation and restoration. It is most relevant to the combination of degraded sites and A. auriculiformes plantations on Red or Laterite soils using the less disturbed forests as the baseline. The intensity of forest use and effects of monoculture plantations on soil ecology (relative to native, mixed forests) is likely to be the critical factor in affecting surface K\xe2\x88\x97 over time. Predicted changes in the intensity of rain events in the future is likely to enhance overland flow on degraded sites on all soils and especially on Black soils, and restoration efforts by all stake-holders, preferably using native or non-invasive species, are needed to address this concern.'

Author: 'K.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe structure, function, and ecosystem services of tropical forest depend on its species richness, diversity, dominance, and the patterns of changes in the assemblages of tree populations over time. Long-term data from permanent vegetation plots have yielded a wealth of data on the species diversity and dynamics of tree populations, but such studies have only rarely been undertaken in tropical forest landscapes that support large human populations. Thus, anthropogenic drivers and their impacts on species diversity and community structure of tropical forests are not well understood. Here we present data on species diversity, community composition, and regeneration status of tropical forests in a human-dominated landscape in the Western Ghats of southern India. Enumeration of 40 plots (50\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa020\xc2\xa0m) results a total of 106 species of trees, 76 species of saplings and 79 species of seedlings. Detrended Correspondence Analysis ordination of the tree populations yielded five dominant groups, along disturbance and altitudinal gradients on the first and second axes respectively. Abundant species of the area such as Albizia amara, Nothopegia racemosa and Pleiospermum alatum had relatively few individuals in recruiting size classes.

Title: 'Poverty, biodiversity and institutions in forest-agriculture ecotones in the Western Ghats and Eastern Himalaya ranges of India'
Author: 'Kamaljit S.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880906004518
Abstract: "AbstractForest-agricultural ecotones are defined as areas that adjoin forests and other natural habitats and that lie between forests and zones of intensive agriculture. These ecotones are critical for conservation of biodiversity and for the maintenance of livelihoods of people that inhabit these areas. Here we focus on three questions: (1) How can we make land use sustainable in forest-agriculture ecotones? (2) How can forest-agriculture ecotones contribute to conservation of biodiversity? (3) How can we improve the institutions that foster sustainability and conservation of biodiversity in forest-agriculture ecotones? We address these questions in the context of interventions to foster biodiversity and rural livelihoods made by the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bangalore, in the Western Ghats and the Eastern Himalayas, 2 of the 34 global hotspots of biodiversity in India. At several sites, ATREE's interventions have improved the livelihoods of several rural communities by providing increased income from non-timber forest products (NTFPs), diversification of livelihoods and enhanced agricultural production. These interventions have improved the prospects for sustainable land use in the forest-agriculture ecotones. Simultaneously, ATREE's interventions have strengthened a range of village level and regional institutions that play a critical role in the rural economy and in conservation of biodiversity. We believe that the path to sustainability in agriculture as well as maintenance of biodiversity passes through adaptive, strong and relevant institutions. The development of institutions however is severely constrained by low social and human capital and the neglect of forest-agriculture ecotones by the governmental agencies and international organizations. We argue that forest-agriculture ecotones offer a means to conserve biodiversity through alleviation of poverty and development of community-based institutions."

We compared tree community characteristics like stem density, basal area, diversity, and species composition of four plots using a tree dataset of eight belt transects (5\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa01000\xc2\xa0m) in the study area. A total of 2,227 individuals of 44 families, 98 genera, and 129 species were recorded. Combretaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Anacardiaceae, showed the greatest importance value index. It was noticed that the most species were contributed by Euphorbiaceae and the tree density varied from 435 ha\xe2\x80\x931 to 767 ha\xe2\x80\x931 with an average basal area of 25.82\xc2\xa0m2/ha. Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Weiner index (H') ranged from 3.76 to 3.96, the Simpson index ranged from 0.96 to 0.97, evenness index ranged from 0.60 to 0.78, and species richness index ranged from 10.04 to 11.24. At present the biodiversity of these forests are under threat due to the anthropogenic and upcoming mining activities. The present study will help us to understand the patterns of tree species composition and diversity in the Eastern Ghats of India."

Abstract: "AbstractThis large-scale, landscape-level study aims to assess tree species diversity, stem density and stand structure of six major tropical hill forests of southern Eastern Ghats, India, namely, Bodamalai (BM), Chitteri (CH), Kalrayan (KA), Kolli hills (KO), Pachaimalai (PM) and Shervarayan hills (SH). The Eastern Ghats of India is relatively under-studied compared with the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. The entire stretch of southern Eastern Ghats was divided into smaller grids of 6.25\xc2\xa0km\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa06.25\xc2\xa0km, totaling to 120 grids. Within each grid, a belt transect of 0.5\xc2\xa0ha (5\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa01000\xc2\xa0m) area was laid and all trees \xe2\x89\xa530\xc2\xa0cm girth at breast height (gbh) were enumerated. A total of 272 tree species (\xe2\x89\xa530\xc2\xa0cm gbh) that belonged to 181 genera and 62 families were recorded in the total 60\xc2\xa0ha area inventoried. Diversity indices such as Shannon, Simpson and Fisher's alpha indices were 2.44, 0.03 and 42.1, respectively, for the whole 60\xc2\xa0ha area. One way ANOVA revealed that the species richness varied significantly across the six sites (F(5,823)\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa04.854, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.0002). Also, the contribution of tree species to total species richness classified by three plant types viz. evergreen, brevi-deciduous and deciduous species varied significantly across the sites (One way ANOVA: F(2,15)\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa010.05, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.002). Similarity indices such as Jaccard and S\xc3\xb8rensen showed that sites CH and KA are more similar in terms of species composition. The total stand density and basal area for the total 60\xc2\xa0ha area were 27,412 stems (457\xc2\xa0stems\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) and 1012.12\xc2\xa0m2 (16.9\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921), respectively. The stand density and basal area for the six sites ranged from 290 (in site BM) to 527\xc2\xa0stems\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 (in site KA) and from 5.6 (in site BM) to 24.4\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 (in site KO), respectively. Stand density and basal area of tree species varied significantly across the six hill complexes (F(5,823)\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa04.85, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.0002 and F(5,823)\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa02.71, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.02, respectively). A positive correlation was obtained between stand density and species richness in sites PM (rs\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.65, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) and SH (rs\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.67, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05), but not in other sites. The predominant tree species in the tropical forests of southern Eastern Ghats include Albizia amara, Euphorbia antiquorum, Canthium dicoccum var. dicoccum, Memecylon edule, Chloroxylon swietenia and Nothopegia heyneana. Taxonomically, Euphorbiaceae constituted the most diverse family with 25 species. Whereas, by tree abundance the Mimosaceae with 4126 stems enumerated from the 60\xc2\xa0ha area formed the dominant family. Bray\xe2\x80\x93Curtis cluster analysis, based on tree species composition and abundance revealed that the low-diverse site BM formed a separate entity from other hill complexes. This large-scale tree diversity inventory provides a baseline data for a variety of investigations and is expected to be useful for effective forest management and biodiversity conservation of southern Eastern Ghats region."

Abstract: 'AbstractA critical handicap to tropical biodiversity conservation efforts in agroecosystems is the unknowns regarding the influence of landscape-scale factors on the persistence of species. To address these uncertainties, we explored two essential landscape-scale questions, within India\xe2\x80\x99s biologically-rich Western Ghats, examining two nearby human-dominated landscapes that dramatically differed in their pattern of land cover. First, how does the proximity of intact forest patches affect bird community composition within agricultural landscapes? Second, can simple remote sensing-derived measures (brightness, wetness, and NDVI) be used to estimate native bird species composition within those landscapes? In both landscapes, as distance to intact forest decreased, the similarity in bird community composition between agricultural areas and intact forest increased. This suggests that the retention of tropical forest bird communities within human-dominated landscapes critically depends on the maintenance of nearby intact forest. In an answer to the second question, the remote sensing measures correlated with forest-affiliated avian species richness in only one of the two landscapes, reflecting an ecological difference between the two in the response of forest bird species to local agricultural conditions. In the landscape where a correlation was found, there was high variation in vegetative structure, which strongly impacted both the remote sensing measures and forest bird species richness. In the other landscape, forest species richness strongly correlated with changes in tree species composition in the agriculture, a factor that could not be detected by the remote sensing metrics. In order to successfully conserve biodiversity in tropical agricultural landscapes, our findings show that it is essential to conserve intact forest within those landscapes and to understand the effect of local agricultural practices on species.'

Title: 'The mammalian communities in coffee plantations around a protected area in the Western Ghats, India'
Author: 'Archana'

Abstract: 'AbstractForest reserves are increasingly becoming isolated, embedded in a matrix of various kinds of human land-use. Coffee plantations form the dominant matrix around many forest reserves in the tropics. In such a situation, the species richness and abundance of animals in coffee plantations can be expected to be determined by their proximity to the forest reserve and characteristics of the local vegetation. We tested this hypothesis with data on mammals (excluding bats, murids and insectivores) collected from 15 coffee plantations around the Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary in the Western Ghats mountain ranges in India, between December 2005 and May 2006. We estimated mammal species richness and abundance from indirect evidence in belt transects and track plots, and from sightings during night surveys. We sampled the vegetation of the plantations from 36 plots of 5\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0m, in each estate. Twenty-eight species of mammals were recorded from 15 plantations. The number of species recorded in individual estates ranged from 5 to 19, with an average of 11.8. Distance from the Sanctuary was the most important factor that negatively influenced species richness, and the abundance of many species. Local vegetation characteristics influenced only the abundance of some small species. Coffee plantations can be a buffer around forest reserves and improve connectivity between them. However, increasing conversion of native shade into silver oak and hunting are two issues that must be addressed if coffee plantations are to form high-quality matrix around forest reserves in the Western Ghats.'

Abstract: "AbstractKnowledge of the social structure of a population is important for a range of fundamental and applied purposes. Group characteristics and population structure of chital (Axis axis) and sambar (Rusa unicolor) were studied in a deciduous habitat of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, Western Ghats, India, during 2008\xe2\x80\x932009. Vehicle transects were monitored monthly to gather information on group\xe2\x80\x93size and age\xe2\x80\x93sex composition of chital and sambar. The average mean group size and crowding for chital and sambar was 13.1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.5 (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01020), 3.6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.2 (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0377) and 33.3, 11.0 respectively. The average adult male:adult female:fawn ratio was 63.4:100:22.3 (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa09391) and 43.9:100:23.7 (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01023) in chital and sambar respectively. The mean group size of chital and sambar varied significantly between seasons (Kruskal\xe2\x80\x93Wallis test, p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0<0.001). Peak fawning season was observed from February to May for chital and May to August for sambar. Group's sex\xe2\x80\x93age composition influenced group formation in both species between seasons at different level. Adult male and fawn were the important predicting variables of change in group size. Skewed female sex ratio was probably due to selective male predation by large predators. Although fawning occurred throughout the year, both species showed seasonality in fawning. The above mentioned patterns differed between species depending upon their ecological adaptation in foraging strategies and habitat preference."

Abstract: 'AbstractIn the Western Ghats (South India), the natural evergreen forest has been highly disturbed and fragmented for 150 years. The resultant vegetation is a mosaic of more or less disturbed forests, pastures, and crops (mainly paddy fields). This paper aims to assess the effects of anthropic disturbance on earthworm communities. Earthworms were collected at the end of the rainy season in a wide range of milieux distinguished by their vegetation, soil properties and topography. The earthworms found belong to the families Octochaetidae, Megascolecidae and Moniligastridae. Densities ranged from 35.3 to 545.3 ind m\xe2\x88\x922. Biomasses ranged from 2.35 to 52.56 g m\xe2\x88\x922. There was no clear relationship between these community characteristics and the vegetation, soil properties or topography as pastures and forests supported high or low densities (or biomasses). Nevertheless, some species were restricted to pastures, some species to forests and some species are found in all milieux.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe Western Ghats in India is one of the 25 global hotspots of biodiversity, and it is the hotspot with the highest human density. This study considers variations in the regional fire regime that are related to vegetation type and past human disturbances in a landscape. Using a combination of remote sensing data and GIS techniques, burnt areas were delineated in three different vegetation types and various metrics of fire size were estimated. Belt transects were enumerated to assess the vegetation characteristics and fire effects in the landscape. Temporal trends suggest increasingly short fire-return intervals in the landscape. In the tropical dry deciduous forest, the mean fire-return interval is 6 years, in the tropical dry thorn forest mean fire-return interval is 10 years, and in the tropical moist deciduous forest mean fire-return interval is 20 years. Tropical dry deciduous forests burned more frequently and had the largest number of fires in any given year as well as the single largest fire (9900\xc2\xa0ha). Seventy percent, 56%, and 30% of the tropical moist deciduous forests, tropical dry thorn forests, and tropical dry deciduous forests, respectively have not burned during the 7-year period of study. The model of fire-return interval as a function of distance from park boundary explained 63% of the spatial variation of fire-return interval in the landscape. Forest fires had significant impacts on species diversity and regeneration in the tropical dry deciduous forests. Species diversity declined by 50% and 60% in the moderate and high frequency classes, respectively compared to the low fire frequency class. Sapling density declined by ca. 30% in both moderate and high frequency classes compared to low frequency class. In tropical moist deciduous ecosystems, there were substantial declines in species diversity, tree density, seedling and sapling densities in burned forests compared to the unburned forests. In contrast forest fires in tropical dry thorn forests had a marginal positive effect on ecosystem diversity, structure, and regeneration.'

Title: 'Methodological and Ideological OptionsDisaggregated economic impact analysis incorporating ecological and social trade-offs and techno-institutional context: A case from the Western Ghats of India'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We propose disaggregated analysis of economic impacts as an alternative to benefit-cost analysis or just valuation.\xe2\x80\xa2This approach is applied to the case of a wildlife sanctuary in Southern India considering only monetizable impacts.\xe2\x80\xa2The shift from a lower to higher conservation status generates a variety of ecological trade-offs, including dis-benefits.\xe2\x80\xa2Costs and benefits vary across stakeholders - some are net gainers and others losers in economic terms.\xe2\x80\xa2But the results are context-specific and sensitive to assumptions about technology, institutions and ecological dynamics.AbstractEconomic valuation of ecosystem benefits and their aggregation in a benefit\xe2\x80\x93cost analysis (BCA) framework is the norm in mainstream environmental economics. But valuation and BCA have also attracted criticisms. \xe2\x80\x98Internal\xe2\x80\x99 criticisms point to the absence of alternative scenarios in valuation, overlooking of ecological trade-offs and dis-services, and inattention to context. Others criticize aggregation across diverse stakeholders and the problem of non-monetizable benefits, and dismiss BCA as fatally flawed. They suggest approaches such as deliberative decision-making and multi-criteria analysis. We propose a middle path that uses the strengths of economic analysis for decision support while avoiding the pitfalls. We disaggregate economic impacts by stakeholder groups, link ecosystem changes to benefits as well as dis-benefits, and examine how socio-technological context shapes the magnitude of economic impact. We illustrate this approach by studying the impact of creating the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple wildlife sanctuary in the Western Ghats forests of southern India. Our analysis shows that while some stakeholders are net beneficiaries, others are net losers. Changes in forest rights, irrigation technologies, and ecosystem dynamics influence the magnitude of benefits and sometimes convert gainers into losers. Such disaggregated analysis can provide useful information for deliberative decision-making and important academic insights on how economic value is generated.'

Title: 'Mountain-associated clade endemism in an ancient frog family (Nyctibatrachidae) on the Indian subcontinent'
Author: 'Ines'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790311004982
Abstract: 'AbstractNight frogs (Nyctibatrachidae) form a family endemic to the Western Ghats, a hill chain along the west coast of southern India. Extant members of this family are descendants of a lineage that originated on the subcontinent during its longtime isolation in the Late Cretaceous. Because the evolutionary history of Nyctibatrachidae has always been tightly connected to the subcontinent, these tropically-adapted frogs are an ideal group for studying how patterns of endemism originated and evolved during the Cenozoic in the Western Ghats. We used a combined set of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA fragments to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of 120 ingroup specimens of all known species of Nyctibatrachidae. Our analyses indicate that, although this family had an early origin on the Indian subcontinent, the early diversification of extant nyctibatrachids happened only in the Eocene. Biogeographic analyses show that dispersal across the Palghat gap and Shencottah gap was limited, which led to clade endemism within mountain ranges of the Western Ghats. It is likely that multiple biota have been affected simultaneously by these prominent geographical barriers. Our study therefore further highlights the importance of considering the Western Ghats\xe2\x80\x93Sri Lanka biodiversity hotspot as an assemblage of distinct mountain regions, each containing endemism and deserving attention in future conservation planning.Graphical abstractDownload full-size imageHighlights\xe2\x96\xba The evolutionary history of nyctibatrachid frogs is reconstructed. \xe2\x96\xba Nyctibatrachids experienced delayed diversification in the Eocene. \xe2\x96\xba Separated parts of the Western Ghats hold distinct nyctibatrachid clades. \xe2\x96\xba The Western Ghats are an assemblage of distinct mountains, each containing endemism.'

We present the ontogenetic trajectory and allometry of the widespread Oriental belostomatid species, Diplonychus rusticus (Fabricius) for the first time. We have measured nine different morphological variables throughout the growth of the bug using both field captured and laboratory reared specimens. Our results suggest that the developmental instars can be distinguished by the size variables, as seen in the Principal Component Analysis. On the basis of a CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection) based regression tree, we also show that the characters \xe2\x80\x93 total length without head and maximum width \xe2\x80\x93 prove to be adequate for effective instar identification. The multivariate allometric growth pattern shows that different body parts exhibit different types of allometry. This is apparent in the allometry exhibited by forelegs and mid and hind legs, which show allometry of opposite polarities. This may be due to the different functions attributed to these body parts. Our results show that the growth pattern in D.\xc2\xa0rusticus is comparable with the New World genus Belostoma, suggesting a conserved growth pattern in the family Belostomatidae.'

Abstract: 'AbstractGlobal biodiversity has already been altered by the climatic changes in various means like species migration, changes in habitat distribution, seasonality changes in phenology etc. In order to implement sustainable conservation or adaptation strategy, it is necessary to understand the impacts of climate change on both ecosystem and species level. Here we present an assessment on current and future habitat suitability distribution of Myristica dactyloides Gaertn. (MD), a medicinally and ecologically important tree species by using a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution model. The future predictions were done for the year 2050 and 2070 using the bioclimatic variables having 1\xc2\xa0km spatial resolution from two different models of fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP5). This study was carried out in the Kolli hill, Eastern Ghats of India. The AUC values confirmed the accuracy of model prediction based on 22 occurrence points. Environmental variables\xe2\x80\x99 contributions were evaluated using jackknife test. The more influencing variables will be annual temperature, annual precipitation and precipitation of wettest month. Finally, this study found that there will be a significant reduction in the habitat suitability distribution of Myristica dactyloides in the year 2050 and 2070 in the study area. Hence with the performance of the model, this study found that MaxEnt could be an effective tool for species rehabilitation and biodiversity conservation planning in the light of climate change.'

Title: 'Litter production and leaf-litter decomposition of selected tree species in tropical forests at Kodayar in the Western Ghats, India'
Author: 'S.M.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112799000626
Abstract: 'AbstractLitter production, standing crop of litter on forest floor and leaf-litter decomposition of selected dominant tree species were studied in the tropical forests at Kodayar in the Western Ghats, India. Mean annual litterfall in the study sites ranged from 5.63 to 8.65\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921. A greater amount of annual litter production was observed in sites II and III, when compared to sites I and IV. This variation in litterfall pattern among the sites could be attributed to species composition. Monthly variation in litterfall pattern showed two peaks, one in the dry season (January\xe2\x80\x93April) and another in November. Contribution of leaf litter to the total litter was significantly (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01) greater compared to other components (woody litter and reproductive parts). In deciduous forests, Terminalia contributed significantly (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) greater amount of leaf litter to annual litter production, followed by Careya arborea, Macaranga peltata, Aporosa lindleyana and Dillenia pentagyna, whereas in evergreen forests, Hopea parviflora contributed the most. The results suggest that species composition and their contribution toward litter becomes important in overall community or site litter production as observed in sites II and III. The litter mass decreased linearly with time. Thin and smooth leaf without prominent skeletal tissues decomposed more rapidly, while thick and tough leaves with prominent midribs and veins took longer time for complete decomposition. The species with high nitrogen content exhibited relatively faster decomposition except in H. parviflora and V. indica. The differences in decay rates and half-life periods are related to structure and nutrient concentration of leaf litter and the environmental factors.'

Abstract: 'AbstractKodagu is one of the green districts in the Western Ghats, which contributes to a major share of coffee production in India with a rich cultural heritage, a significant part of which is a sustainable outlook in all aspects of life. The district is now witnessing a decline in its cultural and environmental vibrancy due to a number of reasons, notably, rapid urbanization, shift from the natural agricultural systems, destruction of the sacred groves, expansion of coffee plantations and reduction of the native green cover. The negative impact is indicated in various environmental statistical records. The College of Forestry, Ponnampet and University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore have proposed the Payment for Ecological Services through landscape labeling that could help alleviate the economic woes of the farmers and consequentially provide an opportunity to restore the ecological balance in Kodagu. The scope of the paper would be to investigate whether PES in conjunction with the cultural and social scenarios would be able to create a cultural renaissance in Kodagu.'

Abstract: 'AbstractSoppina Betta Forests (SBFs; foliage forests) are minor forests allowed by the State for the Areca-grower\xe2\x80\x99s use as organic support in the Western Ghats area of Karnataka, South India. Sustainable utilization of these for foliage and litter (to make composted leaf-manure) and firewood (to boil Areca nuts before drying) would ensure the farmer to stand on his own and prevent him from unduly pressurizing the State Forests. Ten hamlets in Sringeri area of the Western Ghats were selected at random, from each of which nearly 10 farmers were interviewed by PRA technique for a socio-economic survey of the purpose, benefits and management of their individual SBFs. One representative SBF from each of the 10 hamlets was taken up for phytosociological survey and the results were compared with a natural forest benchmark selected nearby. Species diversity at all levels was higher in the SBFs than in the natural forest. Stand densities too were higher, but basal coverages were lower. The farmers were found to promote select species like Aporosalindleyana, Memecylonumbellatum, Syzygiumcumini and S.caryophyllatum for their foliage requirements. The benefits derived, lopping patterns, protection and planting attitudes of the farmers were marked with a differentiating scheme and the relative scores on these four heads of management attributes were summed up into a management value index (MVI). MVI was found to increase with the Areca-landholding status of the farmers, and optimization of the MVI was observed at an Areca-landholding to SBF ratio of 1\xc2\xa0:\xc2\xa01.5\xe2\x80\x932.5 for the low (0\xe2\x80\x931\xc2\xa0ha), intermediate (1\xe2\x80\x932\xc2\xa0ha) and rich (>2\xc2\xa0ha) Areca-landholding categories. The optimization was most pronounced for the low landholding group of farmers. The average size-class distribution of tree species individuals of the 10 SBFs described the expected L-shaped curve similar to that of the natural forest, but possessed larger number of individuals in most of the size-classes.'

Abstract: 'AbstractInfluence of herbaceous weed community on the forest ecosystem structure and function are essential to manage or control weeds effectively. Therefore, an attempt was made to study biomass, litter production and aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) of herbaceous community was studied in natural secondary forest and man-modified ecosystems such as rubber plantation, Albizia plantation and wasteland. Man-modified ecosystems showed significantly greater herb density than the natural ecosystem. This may be due to open habitat in the man-modified ecosystems, which favoured colonisation of exotic weed species resulting in greater herb density. All the landuses studied here showed greater standing crop biomass in the tree layer compared to herbaceous layer. However, herbaceous layer aboveground biomass and net primary production varied among the landuse types considerably. Greater biomass of annual exotic weeds and Lantana camara in these man-modified ecosystem could be attributed to high degree of disturbance and open environment. Greater standing crop biomass and net primary productivity of Chromolaena odorata in rubber plantation may be due to the existing practice of ineffective aboveground mechanical weeding. Lower ANPP and greater biomass accumulation quotient of exotics such as C. odorata and L. camara in the natural secondary forest may be attributed to less favourable resource conditions for its growth and also possibly lack of occurrence of disturbance. Percentage contribution of exotic plants to the total herbaceous community in terms of litter production and ANPP was higher in the wasteland and lower in the disturbed forest. But, the native plants contribution showed a reverse trend. Percentage contribution of exotic plants to the total herbaceous community in terms of litter production and ANPP was higher in the wasteland and lower in the disturbed forest. But, the native plants contribution showed a reverse trend. Greater herbaceous community litter production and net primary productivity in the man-modified ecosystems might be due to faster turnover of ruderal herbaceous community or modification of the tree layer.'

Abstract: 'AbstractStanding crop, rates of production and distribution of very fine (\xe2\x89\xa4 1 mm), fine (> 1 \xe2\x88\x92 \xe2\x89\xa4 3 mm) and coarse (> 3 mm) roots were estimated for one year (August 1993\xe2\x80\x93August 1994) under open and closed canopies of Tropical forest ecosystems at Kodayar in the Western Ghats of India. In the moist deciduous forest very fine root biomass was significantly higher under the open canopies (309 g m\xe2\x88\x922) than in the closed canopies (222 g m\xe2\x88\x922). While in the semi-evergreen and evergreen forest ecosystems closed canopies (Site II: 318, Site III: 315 and Site IV: 275 g m\xe2\x88\x922) were comparatively higher in very fine root biomass than the open canopies (264, 278 and 239 g m\xe2\x88\x922). A similar trend was observed in the fine root productivity also. Under the closed canopies, total fine root standing crop biomass was significantly higher under the evergreen forest (1847\xe2\x80\x932021 g m\xe2\x88\x922) compared with others (1081 g m\xe2\x88\x922 and 1298 g m\xe2\x88\x922). Root production and standing crop biomass showed a seasonal pattern of maximum during the rainy season and minimum in the dry season. Necromass fraction ranged between 52\xe2\x80\x93132 g m\xe2\x88\x922 and the maximum was in the dry period. Localized disturbances such as canopy openings contributed towards the reduction of fine root biomass. Due to the annual wild fire and the consequent grass community dominance in the moist deciduous forest (Site I), greater standing crop of very fine root biomass and net primary productivity was observed. Further, the study revealed that the fine root biomass and production increased significantly due to litter accumulation (P < 0.05) and the soil moisture (P < 0.01) at the ground level. The above results are discussed in the light of understanding the fragility of tropical forests and their management.'

Title: 'Effects of vector control on the population structure of tsetse (Glossina fuscipes fuscipes) in western Kenya'
Author: 'Njelembo J.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Tsetse populations can recover even after being suppressed by over 90%.\xe2\x80\xa2Island subpopulations of tsetse demonstrate intra-population fly size variability.\xe2\x80\xa2Tsetse fly populations that recover after control intervention are smaller in size.\xe2\x80\xa2Over time size and wing shape of tsetse changes.\xe2\x80\xa2Tsetse control intervention could influence changes in wing shape.AbstractDisplacement rates of tsetse affect performance of targets during vector control. Fly size, one of the indicators of population structure usually obtained from wing measurement, is among the determinants of displacement rates. Although recovery of tsetse in previous intervention areas has been widely reported, the population structure of tsetse that recover is rarely evaluated despite being associated with displacements rates. Previously, intervention trials had reduced tsetse densities by over 90% from >3 flies/trap/day to <1fly/trap/day on Big Chamaunga and Manga islands of Lake Victoria in western Kenya. In this study, we assessed the recovery in densities of Glossina fuscipes fuscipes on the two islands and evaluated the effects vector control might have on the population structure. A before and after intervention study was undertaken on four islands of Lake Victoria in western Kenya; Small and Big Chamaunga, Manga and Rusinga Islands, two of which tsetse control intervention had previously been undertaken. Three years after intervention average G. f. fuscipes catches in biconical traps were estimated on each island. Wing centroid size (CS) (a measurement of fly size) and shape, indicators of the population structure of flies from the four islands were compared using geometric morphometric analyses. CS and shape of available female but not male tsetse wings obtained before the intervention trial on Big and Small Chamaunga islands were compared with those from the same islands after the intervention trial. G. f. fuscipes apparent density on the previous intervention islands were>9 flies/trap/day. Irrespective of sex, wing shape did not isolate tsetse based on their islands of origin. The fly size from Big and Small Chamaunga did not differ significantly before intervention trials (P\xe2\x80\xaf=\xe2\x80\xaf0.728). However, three years after the intervention flies from Big Chamaunga were significantly smaller than those from Small Chamaunga (P\xe2\x80\xaf<\xe2\x80\xaf0.003). Further, there was an increase in the divergence of wing morphology between flies collected from Big Chamaunga and those from Small Chamaunga after tsetse control. In conclusion, even though populations are not isolated, vector control could influence the population structure of tsetse by exerting size and wing morphology differential selection pressures. Therefore, we recommend further studies to understand the mechanism behind this as it may guide future vector control strategies.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Four new fossil leaves are recovered from the early Eocene (Gurha Lignite Mine) of northwestern India.\xe2\x80\xa2They show affinities with Anacardiaceae, Malvaceae, Myrtaceae and Rubiaceae.\xe2\x80\xa2These fossil records provide strong evidence of humid tropical and paratropical evergreen forest with monsoon seasonality.AbstractToday the existence of tropical rainforests in the Indian subcontinent is restricted to the fringes of the Western Ghats, greater Assam region and some small places in Odisha. However, the palaeovegetation reconstruction in this study illustrates the existence of equatorial tropical forest in northwestern India (Bikaner, Rajasthan) during the early Eocene. Fossil leaves, described here, were collected from the Gurha lignite mine of Bikaner and showed affinities with Holigarna grahamii (Anacardiaceae), Pterygota alata (Malvaceae), Syzygium spp. (S. fruticosum and S. cumini) (Myrtaceae), and Gardenia spp. (G. lucida and G. gummiefra) (Rubiaceae). Contrary to the present-day dry and desertic conditions, the fossil records provide strong evidence of humid tropical and paratropical evergreen forest with monsoon seasonality existing in and around the study area during the depositional period. Any shift in climatic conditions has drastic effects on the vegetation cover of a region in time and space. This drastic change in climate has led to the extinction of tropical rain forest from this region. This might be due to the northward movement of the Indian subcontinent (away from the equator), formation of the Himalayas and monsoon or changes in monsoon pattern.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (212KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Karl W. Butzer opened up an important line of historical geomorphology on the human use of landforms.\xe2\x80\xa2Human use of landforms encompasses defensive, commercial, and sacred, as well as natural resource-driven processes.\xe2\x80\xa2The Deccan Volcanic Plateau has supported four major precolonial landform-settlement configurations over the past 2000\xe2\x80\xafyears.\xe2\x80\xa2Collectively, these configurations have shaped the formation of a coherent geocultural region.AbstractThis paper takes its inspiration from Karl W. Butzer's course on the Human Use of Landforms at the University of Chicago. It builds upon that concept through an exploration of regional settlement patterns and landforms in the Deccan volcanic province of west-central India. The first section develops a conceptual framework for analyzing human adjustment to landforms on regional, settlement, and site scales. The second section employs that framework to analyze four major landform-settlement configurations in the Deccan from antiquity to the end of the eighteenth century. The Satavahana kingdom (ca. 100\xe2\x80\xafBCE to 200\xe2\x80\xafCE) had a strong southeast to northwest alignment along the Godavari River. Their capital city of Paithan was located at a navigable sacred ford across the river (tirtha), which was linked with upstream confluences (sangams), tanks (kunds), mountain passes (ghats), and port cities on the Arabian Sea. Subsequent Hindu dynasties (ca. 850\xe2\x80\x931300\xe2\x80\xafCE) shifted from fluvial landforms to a north-south alignment along steep mesa escarpments and buttes in the central Deccan that provided defensive fortress and cave temple sites. Sultanate and Mughal forces expanded the urban footprint on nearby plateau lands at sites protected by surrounding mesas (ca. 1330\xe2\x80\x931700\xe2\x80\xafCE). These cities were supported by local watershed runoff and long distance water channels. The final precolonial phase of Deccan settlement entailed a shift from the semiarid central plateaus to humid headwaters of the Western Ghats, whose buttes and scarps provided sites for scores of forts controlled by the founder of the Maratha empire Chhatrapati Shivaji in the seventeenth century. Maratha success led to development downstream at the capital city of Pune (1627\xe2\x80\x931803\xe2\x80\xafCE), located at a river confluence flanked by mesas, which combined the strategies of previous periods. Over two millennia these four distinct, yet intersecting, patterns of human-landform relations have shaped an evolving geocultural region on the Deccan plateau that deserves comparison with other flood basalt regions."

Title: 'Litter production and decomposition dynamics in moist deciduous forests of the Western Ghats in Peninsular India'
Author: 'B.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378112792903357
Abstract: 'AbstractA field study was conducted in the moist deciduous forests of the Western Ghats (India) to test the following three hypotheses: (1) Litter production in tropical forests is a function of the floristic composition, density, basal area and disturbance intensity; (2) Decay rate constants of tropical species is an inverse function of the initial lignin/nitrogen ratio; (3) Decomposition rates in tropical forests are faster than temperate forests.Litter fall was estimated by installing 63 litter traps in the moist deciduous forests of Thrissur Forest Division in the Western Ghats at three sites. Litter fall followed a monomodal distribution pattern with a distinct peak during the dry period from November\xe2\x80\x93December to March\xe2\x80\x93April.Dillenia pentagyna, Grewia tiliaefolia, Macrosolen spp.,Xylia xylocarpa, Terminalia spp.,Lagerstroemia lanceolata, Cleistanthus collinus, Bridelia retusa, andHelicteres isora were the principal litter producing species at these sites. The annual litter fall ranged from 12.18 to 14.43 t ha\xe2\x88\x921. Structural attributes of vegetation such as floristic composition, basal area, density and disturbance intensity did not directly influence litter fall rates.Leaf litter decay rates for six dominant tree species were assessed following the standard litter bag technique. One hundred and eight litter bags per species containing 20 g samples were installed in the forest floor litter layer at the same three sites selected for the litter fall quantification exercise. The residual litter mass decreased linearly with time for all species. In general, less disturbed sites and species adapted to higher nitrogen availabilities exhibited relatively higher decay rate coefficients (k). The rapid organic matter turnover observed in comparison with published temperate forest litter decay rates confirms that tropical moist deciduous forest species are characterised by faster decomposition rates.Mean concentrations of N, P and K in the litter were profoundly variable amongst the dominant species. Initial nitrogen content of the leaf litter varied from 0.65 to 1.6%, phosphorus from 0.034 to 0.077% and potassium from 0.25 to 0.62%.C. collinus, an understorey shrub consistently recorded the lowest litter concentrations for all nutrients. The overriding pattern is one of higher nutrient levels in the overstorey leaf litter and lower concentrations in the understorey litter. Furthermore, as decomposition proceeded, the nitrogen concentration of the residual biomass increased.'

Abstract: 'AbstractWithin the framework of a programme on the functioning of dense moist evergreen forests of the Western Ghats, the French Institute of Pondicherry, in collaboration with the Karnataka Forest Department, installed permanent plots to monitor the dynamics of a low elevation forest. The preliminary results of the comparison of the demographic processes in two compartments are presented: one compartment had never been harvested, while the other was selectively felled in 1979\xe2\x80\x931980. They are compared in terms of species composition, recruitment, mortality and individual growth, in order to describe the natural forest dynamics and evaluate the impact of selective felling. In both compartments, the mortality rate, around 0.9% yr\xe2\x88\x921, is lower than in other tropical moist evergreen forests, while the average diameter increment, at 2.1 (unlogged stand) and 2.9 mm yr\xe2\x88\x921 (logged stand), is higher. The impact of selective felling, 10 to 15 years after the harvest, is mainly noticeable: (i) on mortality of trees with dbh>40 cm belonging to lower canopy and intermediate stratum species which died about four times more in the logged compartment; and (ii) on diameter increment of emergent and upper canopy tree species whose growth is still stimulated by about 50%. Despite the general trend of a reduction in the difference between the density and the basal area of the two compartments, medium-term modification of the demographic processes among the various structural ensembles in the logged compartment, indicates that selective felling may not be sustainable in the long-term without consequences on the forest structure and composition.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe black inch worm, Hyposidra talaca (Walker) (Geometridae: Lepidoptera) has earned considerable importance as a defoliator during last decade in north east India. Characteristic features of H. talaca, such as switching from wild plants to Camellia sinensis, and completion of 6\xe2\x80\x938 generations in a year without winter diapause appear to be the major reasons for persistence of the defoliator on C. sinensis. There are reports on the aggressive infestation of the pest on C. sinensis than on alternate host plants and development of high tolerance/resistance to certain insecticides. Till date, more than one hundred alternate host plants have been recorded for H. talaca, but with very few natural enemies. To manage this pest chemically, synthetic pesticides are widely used. Integrated management is recently being encouraged wherein cultural, mechanical, physical, biological and chemical methods have been contemplated. This review collates the work and literature on the ecology of H. talaca and offers an analysis of the problems encountered in managing the defoliator in tea plantations. Further, future directions for better management of H. talaca are suggested.'

Title: 'The groundwater recharge response and hydrologic services of tropical humid forest ecosystems to use and reforestation: Support for the \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltration-evapotranspiration trade-off hypothesis\xe2\x80\x9d'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Unique data on hydrologic effects of tropical reforestation and human-use.\xe2\x80\xa2Clear evidence for the \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltration-evapotranspiration trade-off hypothesis\xe2\x80\x9d in relation to hydrologic services.\xe2\x80\xa2Comprehensive paper on hydrology of Western Ghats, a globalbiodiversity hotspot.\xe2\x80\xa2Hydrologic processes and recharge to ground-water across land-coveranalyzed using multiple approaches and spatial scales.SummaryThe hydrologic effects of forest use and reforestation of degraded lands in the humid tropics has implications for local and regional hydrologic services but such issues have been relatively less studied when compared to the impacts of forest conversion. In particular, the \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltration-evapotranspiration trade-off\xe2\x80\x9d hypothesis which predicts a net gain or loss to baseflow and dry-season flow under both, forest degradation or reforestation depending on conditions has not been tested adequately. In the Western Ghats of India, we examined the hydrologic responses and groundwater recharge and hydrologic services linked with three ecosystems, (1) remnant tropical evergreen forest (NF), (2) heavily-used former evergreen forest which now has been converted to tree savanna, known as degraded forest(DF), and (3) exotic Acacia plantations (AC, Acacia auriculiformis) on degraded former forest land. Instrumented catchments ranging from 7 to 23\xc2\xa0ha representing these three land-covers (3 NF, 4 AC and 4 DF, in total 11 basins), were established and maintained between 2003 and 2005 at three sites in two geomorphological zones, Coastal and Up-Ghat (Malnaad). Four larger (1\xe2\x80\x932\xc2\xa0km2) catchments downstream of the head-water catchments in the Malnaad with varying proportions of different land-cover and providing irrigation water for areca-nut and paddy rice were also measured for post-monsoon baseflow. Daily hydrological and climate data was available at all the sites. In addition, 36\xc2\xa0min data was available at the Coastal site for 41\xc2\xa0days as part of the opening phase of the summer monsoon, June\xe2\x80\x93July 2005.Low potential and actual evapotranspiration rates during the monsoon that are similar across all land-cover ensures that the main control on the extent of groundwater recharge during the south-west monsoon is the proportion of rainfall that is converted into quick flow rather than differences in evapotranspiration between the different land cover types. The Flow duration curves demonstrated a higher frequency and longer duration of low flows under NF when compared to the other more disturbed land covers in both the Coastal and Malnaad basins. Groundwater recharge estimated using water balance during the wet-season in the Coastal basins under NF, AC and DF was estimated to be 50%, 46% and 35% respectively and in the Malnaad it was 61%, 55% and 36% respectively. Soil Water Infiltration and Movement (SWIM) based recharge estimates also support the pattern (46% in NF; 39% in AC and 14% in DF). Furey\xe2\x80\x93Gupta filter based estimates associated with the Coastal basins also suggest similar groundwater recharge values and trends across the respective land-covers: 69% in NF, 49% in AC, and 42% in DF. Soil water potential profiles using zero flux plane methods suggest that during the dry-season, natural forests depend on deep soil moisture and groundwater. Catchments with higher proportion of forest cover upstream were observed to sustain flow longer into the dry-season. These hydrologic responses provide some support towards the \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltration-evapotranspiration trade-off\xe2\x80\x9d hypothesis in which differences in infiltration between land-cover rather than evapotranspiration determines the differences in groundwater recharge, low flows and dry-season flow. Groundwater recharge is the most temporally stable under natural forest, although substantial recharge occurs under all three ecosystems, which helps to sustain dry-season flow downstream in higher order streams that sustain local communities and agro-ecosystems. In addition to spatial scale effects, greater attention also needs to be given to the role of hydrogeology within the context of the above hypothesis and its implications for hydrologic services.'

Tourism has long been linked with spirituality and where this is the case (for example pilgrimage travel), it is considered to pave the way for personal transformation. Linking spiritual tourism to yoga tourism is a fait accompli, as is drawing similar associations with wellness and pilgrimage tourism on account of allied and abiding motivations predicated on uniting mind, body and spirit and these ruminations are central to this paper. More recently, there has been a growing chorus calling for the decolonisation of yoga on account of its commodification and industrialisation, and especially concerning what is argued to be a shift away from its spiritual and transformative tenets. The underlying meaning of the Sanskrit word yuj from which yoga is derived alludes to the pursuit of achieving a sense of union with something higher than oneself, and this is arguably one of the key drivers for its contemporary acceptance. Linkages between spirituality and yoga tourism through an examination of the motivations of Western yoga devotees in Maharashtra, India provide the canvas for this analysis. The motivations for yoga related travel and the broader implications for yoga and spiritual tourism are discussed. This article draws from two periods of exploratory fieldwork conducted in 2014 and 2015 in Maharashtra, India. A qualitative, case study scaffold underpinned by serious leisure as a conceptual framework (Stebbins, 2001) was constructed.'

Title: 'Impact of iron ore mining on suspended sediment response in a tropical catchment in Kudremukh, Western Ghats, India'
Author: 'Jagdish'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112705007486
Abstract: 'AbstractAvailable secondary suspended sediment data from the 1980s was analyzed together with new data collected during 2001\xe2\x80\x932003 at instrumented sites upstream and downstream of open-cast mining activities (\xe2\x88\xbc4.2\xc2\xa0km2) in an enclosure within the Kudremukh National Park in south India. More than 50% of the suspended sediment load in both the Bhadra River and Bhadra Reservoir comes from mining-affected lands that occupy <1% of the total catchment area (1968\xc2\xa0km2). For baseflow conditions during the post-monsoon period of 2001, 0.02\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0km\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0day\xe2\x88\x921 of suspended sediment was discharged at the upstream site compared with 0.74\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0km\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0day\xe2\x88\x921 downstream of the mine. During the 2002 and 2003 monsoons, these rates increased to about 1.99 and 7.89\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0km\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0day\xe2\x88\x921 for upstream and downstream sites, respectively. The specific sediment yield above the mine is 239\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0km\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 versus 947\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0km\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 downstream. Sediment concentration downstream was significantly higher than upstream for all conditions. The current annual suspended sediment load below the mine ranges from 100,000 to over 150,000\xc2\xa0Mg, depending on the size and frequency of large rain events. During the 2002 and 2003 monsoon seasons, 20\xe2\x80\x9330% of the total suspended sediment load during the sampling period of 67 and 123 days, respectively, was transported in one single day and over one-third of the total recorded suspended load is discharged in less than 4 days in each monsoon. Daily rainfall and maximum hourly rainfall intensity were reasonable predictors of daily sediment loads downstream of the mine (R2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.71 and 0.575, respectively; p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001). However, the upstream response was not predicted well by these variables, suggesting an absence of rapid overland pathways and/or reduced availability of easily transportable sediment on the less-disturbed lands above the mining area. Large episodic sediment events downstream of the mine were associated with daily rainfall >150\xc2\xa0mm and hourly intensities exceeding 20\xc2\xa0mm. One hundred and nine such episodic events occurred between 1990 and 2001 alone. A conservative estimate of the total suspended sediment load in the Bhadra River after mining commenced in the 1980s is 1.37\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0106\xc2\xa0Mg, although the actual value could be considerably higher, up to 107\xc2\xa0Mg. Comparison of historic data and another study in 1994, with recent measurements confirm that mining and associated activities in Kudremukh National Park are the greatest sources of sediment entering the Bhadra River; and the Bhadra river carries considerably more sediment now than before mining started damaging riverine ecosystems and disrupting downstream water resources.'

Abstract: 'AbstractA new design framework is introduced for forest structure optimization based on a genetic algorithm landscape encoding and landscape ecology metrics. Landscape ecology is an important interface between the forest management community, which is a traditional user of operations research methods, and the biological conservation community which is relatively new to OR methods and whose goals are increasingly allied with the spatial ecology concepts emerging from landscape ecology. Deforestation and forest fragmentation are increasingly recognized as the underlying drivers of global biodiversity loss, hence forestry management will need to explicitly incorporate spatial ecology objectives.A deforestation model is presented which simulates a landscape progressively fragmenting by the incremental removal of forest patches. Principal components analysis (PCA) of multiple deforestation simulations captures the relative influence of the mean proximity index and the mean nearest neighbour distance, two widely used landscape ecology metrics. An evolutionary programming method based on a genetic encoding of landscape structure is used to optimize forest patch selection by maximizing landscape performance with respect to single and multiple landscape ecology metrics weighted according to the PCA.This optimization approach is envisioned as a key component of a new forestry OR paradigm for designing multi-use landscape systems, incorporating both biodiversity and community needs.'

Title: 'Modern pollen rain from the Biligirirangan\xe2\x80\x93Melagiri hills of southern Eastern Ghats, India'

Abstract: 'AbstractA total of 39 soil surface samples collected between 11\xc2\xb030\xe2\x80\xb2N 76\xc2\xb045\xe2\x80\xb2E and 12\xc2\xb045\xe2\x80\xb2N 78\xc2\xb015\xe2\x80\xb2E from the mainly deciduous forests in the Biligirirangan\xe2\x80\x93Melagiri hills of the southern Eastern Ghats were analysed for their pollen content. The samples are distributed among four different deciduous and evergreen vegetation types between 210 and 1700\xc2\xa0m altitudes and fall within three distinct rainfall regimes. The aims of this paper are to provide new data on the modern pollen rain from the Southern Eastern Ghats, a region characterized by a unique and complex climate and vegetation, and to interpret these data using multivariate statistics and the diagram of pollen percentages. We could distinguish first between the deciduous and the evergreen forests and then also between different types of deciduous forest. The distinction between the evergreen and deciduous forests was based on a humidity gradient and that among the deciduous forests on a physiognomic gradient identified through correspondence analysis. The above analysis also allowed us to identify a set of 14 pollen taxa markers and 11 associated pollen taxa that help differentiate the evergreen from deciduous forests. Similarly, a set of 12 pollen taxa markers and six associated pollen taxa was demarcated to help distinguish woodland formations from scrub and thicket formations, among the deciduous vegetation. We could also differentiate amongst the four distinct vegetation types sampled, on the basis of distinct associations of both tree and herb pollen taxa according to their relative abundance in the pollen diagram as well as on the proportion of total arboreal pollen. The ground cover of grasses and other herbaceous plants in the deciduous forests is effectively demonstrated by percentages of non-arboreal pollen varying between 40 and 70%. The 1000\xc2\xa0m altitude limit reflecting a gradient of humidity and the physiognomic gradient among deciduous forests seem to be important in this region.'

Title: 'Resilience of an ancient tropical forest landscape to 7500\xc2\xa0years of environmental change'

Abstract: 'AbstractThere is growing recognition that the fate of the world\xe2\x80\x99s terrestrial biodiversity depends on the management of human-dominated tropical forest landscapes. While global environmental change is transforming the ecology of tropical forests, a number of studies have also demonstrated that tropical forests are able to recover following disturbance. But are tropical forests resilient to environmental and anthropogenic disturbances over timescales of centuries or millennia? Here we examine the relationship between vegetation cover and variation in monsoon rainfall, soil erosion, and fire over 7500\xc2\xa0years in an ancient tropical landscape in the Western Ghats of India. We collected two overlapping sediment sequences at one study site and analysed them with palaeoecological techniques to reconstruct vegetation cover. Results suggest that climate and land-use changes might have had synergistic effects on this forested landscape, although the relationship between these factors and vegetation cover has varied over time. Results also indicate that the weakening of monsoon around 5750 BP might have caused a threshold event altering this landscape to a low tree-cover state. Although anthropogenic fire has maintained this landscape in low tree cover state from 3500 BP, this degraded tree\xe2\x80\x93grassland mosaic has remained relatively resilient to fluctuations in environmental and anthropogenic factors. Tree taxa present throughout the sequence have lighter seeds than those absent in parts of the sequence, suggesting that dispersal mode might be an important factor in their persistence. Despite maintaining a degraded and fragmented forest mosaic, however, this landscape has supported populations of heavy-seeded trees and a probable refuge to their dispersal agents. We suggest that retaining tree cover on this landscape, even if fragmented, is key to maintaining its ecological resilience to environmental and anthropogenic disturbance.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2A review of a history of non-timber forest product use within tropical forests.\xe2\x80\xa2A set of ecological principles for categorizing the ecology and growth of NTFP\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\xa2A framework for incorporating non-timber products into forest restoration.\xe2\x80\xa2A synthesis on the ecology and silviculture of non-timber forest products.AbstractRural communities have traditionally valued forests for a diversity of products and services, with timber serving a minor role. No-where has this diversity been greater than in tropical South Asia, and in particular south India and Sri Lanka. As economies advance towards full development and populations become increasingly urbanized, forests become increasingly valued for their services. National development generally occurs at differing rates in different regions, with rural forest dependent communities falling behind and pockets of poverty long remaining. The demand for \xe2\x80\x98non-timber forest products\xe2\x80\x99 (NTFPs) therefore changes from subsistence to monetary based values. Overall, though, forests have suffered an unprecedented decline with development in the tropics, especially in Asia. This necessitates restoration which takes account of the enrichment of economy, wellbeing and culture which forest products provide. Methods for such restoration, and the fundamental principles upon which these must rest, are presented for species yielding NTFP\xe2\x80\x99s. In this paper we first review the history of NTFP species use within south India and Sri Lanka. Second we provide a description of the broad regional characterizations of the forest formations within this region in relation to their affiliated patterns of NTFP use and exploitation. We consider seven guilds as a way to categorize NTFP\xe2\x80\x99s into autecological groups for application in restoration silviculture, and use it as a framework to suggest restoration protocols for South Asian forests. We use examples of scenarios based on experimental studies of NTFP\xe2\x80\x99s in reforestation trials which take account of different social values and land tenures. We conclude with a call for further research.'

Immature black flies are major components of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages in streams and play a vital role in nutrient dynamics. In this study, we examined effect of hierarchical dynamics (spatio-temporal pattern) on the distribution of immature black flies in South Indian streams. The sampling was done in streams of Western Ghats, South India. A total of 16 species belong to two subgenera: Simulium (10 species) and Gowmphostilbia (6 species) of Simulium were observed. Alpha diversity indices were analyzed, which indicate the abundance and species richness between sampling sites. Non-parametric analysis recognized the key environmental variables including latitude and stream order. Subsequently, the monsoon influences the larval assemblages and its association was high in leaf litter as revealed through statistical analyses. Although the members of the immature black fly assemblage with different environmental factors, they are very closely related to spatial and temporal organization and secondarily with other factors prevailing in streams.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (136KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Successional patterns and gap phase dynamics of a humid tropical forest of the Western Ghats of Kerala, India: ground vegetation, biomass, productivity and nutrient cycling'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe population dynamics of the ground vegetation and its energetics such as biomass accumulation and net primary productivity, and the nutrient cycling patterns in the humid tropical forest of the Western Ghats in India are largely determined by gap age and by whether gaps are formed naturally or through selection felling. Responses of plant categories such as herbs, shrubs, tree seedlings and saplings also vary depending upon gap type and age. An exotic species such as Chromolaena odorata occurred only in selection-felled gaps ((9 \xc2\xb1 3)\xe2\x88\x92(49 \xc2\xb1 4) individuals (100 m)\xe2\x88\x922). Nilgirianthus ciliatus, a dominant shrub, plays a key role in the gaps in determining population dynamics of others. The net primary productivity of the ground vegetation, which is about 31.17 \xc2\xb1 4.26 kg (100 m)\xe2\x88\x922 year\xe2\x88\x921 in an undisturbed site, increased a year after gap formation to 102.82 \xc2\xb1 6.46 kg (100 m)\xe2\x88\x922 year\xe2\x88\x921 in natural gaps and to 71.82 \xc2\xb1 2.36 kg (100 m)\xe2\x88\x922 year\xe2\x88\x921 in selection-felled gaps. Five years after gap formation, net primary productivity of the ground vegetation declined considerably, this being related to decline in fast-growing shrub and secondary tree species in the vegetation and gap closure. A similar trend was also recorded for the rates of nutrient uptake and nutrient accumulation in the vegetation.In natural gaps the soil nutrient level increased gradually with gap age. This could be attributed to slow release of nutrients from the fallen trunks and nutrient storage in the rapidly recovering vegetation. In contrast, in selection-felled gaps, the quantities of soil nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and magnesium were higher in 1-year-old gaps than in undisturbed sites, owing to the release of these nutrients from leaf litter and wood debris which were deposited in larger quantities within the gap itself, and owing to sparse ground vegetation resulting from the greater disturbance of the soil, in the first 1 or 2 years. The fractional annual turnover rates of elements of the ground vegetation and the soil were higher in 1-year-old gaps and declined with gap age. The significance of these results for forest management is discussed.'

Abstract: 'AbstractRauvolfia serpentina L. is a high value medicinal plant having wide distribution in the tropics as well as other parts of the world. Thirteen accessions of Rauvolfia collected from different locations in the Western Ghat region of the peninsular India were analyzed for genetic variation using 15 ISSR primers. The 91 polymorphic amplicons generated were statistically analyzed using WinDist and PopGene software to calculate various diversity indices. Contrary to the general concept of low genetic variation associated with inbreeders, R. serpentina exhibits high genetic diversity as the similarity index value based on Nei and Li\xe2\x80\x99s similarity coefficient ranges from 0.44 to 0.92 with mean value of 0.70. This is supported by other diversity parameters like Degree of genetic differentiation (Gst), Gene flow (Nm), Nei\xe2\x80\x99s gene diversity (h) and Shannon index of genetic diversity (I). Cluster analysis showed characteristic grouping which is not in accordance with their geographical affiliation. The result indicates that ISSR markers are sufficiently informative in assessing genetic diversity across wild accessions of R. serpentina. The high genetic diversity observed in this otherwise self-pollinated plant entails the need for evolving effective ex-situ strategy for long-term conservation of this medicinal herb.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Though widely distributed, Rauvolfia serpentina is in IUCN red list. \xe2\x96\xba The plant shows high genetic diversity despite being an inbreeder. \xe2\x96\xba Cluster analysis did not reflect geographical affiliation of the accessions. \xe2\x96\xba The high genetic diversity may be due to its broad genetic base. \xe2\x96\xba Ex-situ conservation and homestead cultivation recommended for conservation.'

Abstract: 'AbstractOur understanding of the role of institutions and property-rights regimes in natural resource management has matured through the work of new institutional economists and common-property theorists. Even so, this literature has yet to establish clear connections between successful resource management, and a given property regime\xe2\x80\x99s spatio-temporal fit. Examining people\xe2\x80\x93forest interaction within a state-managed forest regime in India\xe2\x80\x99s Western Ghats, this paper argues that regime efficacy in satisfying user needs, hinges on appropriately reflecting particular sociospatial contexts and incorporating temporal flexibility into its normative structure. To these ends, this study analyzes institutional structure regulating forest use and management, and examines data collected through extensive fieldwork, in-depth interviews and informal conversations with local villagers and foresters. The results suggest that user responses to access conditions, and their rationales for engaging in particular extraction practices, vary based on caste/class-based perceptions of regime legitimacy, distributional equity, and historical proprietorship rights. Furthermore, the analysis questions the viability of locally managed regimes under such heterogeneous social settings. Rather, this research recognizes the state\xe2\x80\x99s vital role in mediating resource access. It suggests that regime efficacy can be fostered through state\xe2\x80\x93civil society partnerships, widely distributed stakeholder-ship and firmly embedded regimes that adapt to changing sociospatial contexts through modifications to conditions of use and access. Based on the analysis, this paper explores an initial set of sociospatial and temporal parameters that promote institutional efficacy in management, and thus lays the groundwork for future studies in institutional and political ecology.'

Abstract: 'AbstractForests and grassy vegetation (savannas and grasslands) are alternative ecosystem states in many tropical landscapes. Relative to forests the grassy ecosystems are poorly known and poorly conserved, partly because they were thought to be products of forest clearance. However many grasslands have proved to be ancient. Commensurate with their antiquity, grassy biomes have distinct suites of plant and animal species that contribute a large fraction of the diversity of forest\xe2\x80\x93grassland mosaics. Grasslands differ strikingly from forests in their ecology and in the nature of threats to their future. Here we highlight the high biodiversity value of grassy biomes and, in contrast to tropical forests, we illustrate the importance of fire in maintaining these systems. We discuss the major threats to, and consequences for, biodiversity in these regions including land clearance and elevated CO2-driven forest expansion. Finally we focus on the difficulties of grassland restoration. A new approach to understanding and conserving grassy ecosystems, free from cultural prejudices of the past, is long overdue.'

Title: 'Late Pleistocene\xe2\x80\x93Holocene monsoon variations on climate, landforms and vegetation cover in southwestern India: An overview'
Author: 'Ruta B.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618216300945
Abstract: 'AbstractSignatures of monsoon variability preserved in the Late Quaternary sediments of southwestern India have been decoded and addressed using biological proxies along with geochronological data. Barring sediments beyond the threshold for conventional 14C dating, Late Pleistocene sequences have been recognized both in Konkan and Kerala basins. Konkan area has only subsurface continental/lacustrine Late Pleistocene, whereas Kerala coast has mixed facies. The landscape as well as the vegetation cover has been substantially modified and the fossil contents and related palaeoenvironment provided ample evidence to demonstrate the landscape and vegetation dynamics since Late Pleistocene. Evidence of Myristica swamps until Late Pleistocene and its subsequent replacement by riparian forest towards Late Holocene in Konkan has been a significant impact of monsoon variations on the tropical rain forests. The prevalence of such freshwater swamps and a sensitive habitat indicated that Konkan had enjoyed an extended period of rainfall due to the combined effects of both SW and NE monsoons until the Late Pleistocene. The tropical rainforest cover along Kerala coast has shrunken considerably and pieces of evidence suggest that the entire terrain west of Sahyadri (Western Ghats) was under dense forest cover during the Holocene Climatic Optimum (9.0\xe2\x80\x936.0\xc2\xa0k\xc2\xa0yrs\xc2\xa0BP) when the region had witnessed heavy precipitation much higher than that of the present. The forest land has been converted into major wetlands and present ecology is unsuitable to support evergreen forests and it can be concluded that coastal plains and associated landforms were covered by thick tropical evergreen forests which got destroyed by flooding towards Middle Holocene. Development of a chain of wetland system all along Kerala coast, loss of sheltered habitat and mangrove cover, and loss of sensitive freshwater Myristica swamps are some of the significant aspects brought in while addressing the monsoon variability in southwestern India.'

Abstract: 'AbstractRural water supply schemes in India are generally designed for domestic uses. However, the multiple water use priorities of poor rural households in order to reduce their hardship and enhance food production, health and income mean that in water-scarce areas, domestic water use can run into conflict with productive water use. The failure of water supply agencies to design a water supply system for multiple uses results in communities not being able to realize the full potential of water as a social good. This chapter identifies various domestic and productive water requirements of rural households. Thereafter, a composite index which captures the vulnerability of rural households to problems associated with lack of water for multiple needs was assessed for three selected regions of Maharashtra, each representing a different agro-ecological and socioeconomic setting.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Investigation of terpenoids in Early Paleogene resins from western India\xe2\x80\xa2Significant occurrence of diterpenoids reveals their coniferous origin.\xe2\x80\xa2Diterpenoid distribution suggests the existence of podocarps during Early Paleogene.\xe2\x80\xa2Dipterocarps and podocarps were the resin producers in Paleogene rainforest of Asia.AbstractThe terpenoid composition of well-preserved fresh and oxidized fossil resins (ambers) from Early Paleogene lignite-bearing sequences of India have been examined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for determining their botanical origin. The samples were collected from two sedimentary basins viz. Barmer (Akli Formation) and Bikaner-Nagaur (Palana Formation), western India. The total extracts of the studied ambers are represented by hydronaphthalenes; sesquiterpenoids and significant occurrence of diterpenoids. Such terpenoid distribution is typical for gymnosperm, especially conifer derived sources. The diterpenoids are comprised of majorly abietane, phyllocladane, kaurane, pimarane/isopimarane and podocarpane class compounds. Tertracyclic diterpenoids such as 18-norkauranes, ent-16\xce\xb2(H)-kaurane and 16\xce\xb1(H)-phyllocladane and a rearranged tricyclic diterpenoid, rosane are detected in the fossil resins from Barmer Basin. The occurrence of tetracyclic diterpenoids and rosane together with 8,13-dimethyl-16-norpodocarpa-6-ene suggests that Podocarpaceae family is the possible source of the ambers. However, chemotaxonomic assignment at family level for the fossil resin from Bikaner-Nagaur Basin is difficult due to the absence of source specific diterpenoids. Previous reports had documented the occurrence of angiosperm-derived dammar resins from Early Paleogene sediments of India (Dutta et al., 2009; Rust et al., 2010). The present study suggests that the Early Paleogene resins of the equatorial rainforests were not always represented by the dammar resins derived from Dipterocarpaceae, a family of angiosperm, some of them were also contributed by the conifers.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe palaeobotanical and palynological data along with physical proxies obtained from Konkan, western India, have been addressed while ascertaining the vegetation response to monsoon variations since Late Pleistocene (\xe2\x88\xbc53,000 yrs\xc2\xa0BP). The retrieved plant fossil assemblage, being a sensitive indicator of climate changes, has important implications in palaeoclimate study of the Late Pleistocene as it is the first of its kind in the entire 7500\xc2\xa0km long coastline of India. The plant fossil assemblage of the lacustrine sediments forms potential evidence for the prevalence of wet evergreen forest in the Late Pleistocene (\xe2\x88\xbc44,000 yrs\xc2\xa0BP). This scenario was attributed to prevalence of an extended period of rainfall of both the Southwest (SW) and Northeast (NE) monsoon in Konkan, although the Indian subcontinent was under the influence of active tectonic processes. Numerous fossil plant taxa are now confined to freshwater Myristica swamps of Southeast Asia in general and that of southwestern India in particular suggesting that these areas maintain a similar monsoon trend to that existing prior to 44,000 yrs\xc2\xa0BP. On the other hand, the NE monsoon did not reappear during the Early Holocene, when the SW monsoon became strong along the Konkan coast. Many of the plant species of the fossil assemblage have been displaced from Konkan as a response to weakening of the monsoons since the Late Pleistocene and towards the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The aridity/reduced rainfall since Late Pleistocene, including the LGM, and limited terrestrial accumulation in the Early Holocene suggests an ecological shift and subsequent replacement of evergreen forest cover and a possible break in sedimentation. Palynological evidence of the Late Holocene (<3000 yrs\xc2\xa0BP) fluvio-lacustrine sediments reveals that the evergreen forest could not reappear/rejuvenate in Konkan due to such climatic stress, in contrast to southwestern India and Sri Lanka where extended rainfall was still prevalent. The hypothesis of an extended period of monsoonal rains prior to 44,000 yrs\xc2\xa0BP in the present humid tropical parts of Konkan holds significance, as data on paleosols and vertebrate fossils from the semi-arid/arid parts of western India indicate relatively wet climate and wetland flood plains.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe sustainable indigenous agro-ecosystems of India, a majority of which are degraded or destroyed, need protection. The main objective of this study was to analyse the traditional agro-ecosystems from structural and functional point of view and their interactions with other biophysical and socio-economic characters with a view to offer possible solutions. Analysis of traditional agro-ecosystems of three tribal villages, inhabited by Kondhs of Eastern Ghats of Orissa, India, revealed that cultivated land occupied 66% of the total land area. This covered valley, shifting and home garden cultivation. Under valley, rice (Oryza sativa L.) showed the maximum productivity (2\xe2\x80\x934\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) among the crops. Minor millets and redgram (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) were cultivated under shifting cultivation in one of the villages. Vegetables and spices were the main crop under home garden. In valley agriculture human and draught power were the major inputs of energy, while in shifting cultivation human labour was the only source. Out of the total agricultural yield, 52.5, 90.6 and 75.9% were consumed in the villages of Rajikakhola, Nediguda and Badruguda, respectively. When agriculture, forest and animal husbandry sectors were taken together the average share of agricultural sector to the total consumption in the villages was 68.4%, the rest being contributed by forest, while the contribution of animal husbandry was almost negligible. Agricultural production can be stabilized through available rain water management, application of organic manure to agricultural fields and protection of the existing forests. Abandoned Podu (i.e. shifting cultivation) fields can be improved through agro-forestry practices.'

Abstract: "AbstractA 98\xc2\xa0cm core from Potapuram Cheruvu, a rain-fed tank in the Nallamalai Hills of south India, has been palynologically analyzed to study the changes in vegetation and climate of the recent past. This run-off harvesting reservoir, chosen on the basis of remote sensing analysis and field surveys, is not linked with any major river. Its water level is the lowest in the summer, for two to three months, during which time the sampling was carried out. The site, lying south of the \xe2\x80\x9ccore monsoon zone\xe2\x80\x9d, gets most of its rains from the south-west monsoon. Palynological studies yielded 75 pollen taxa with \xe2\x80\x9cdryness\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cwetness\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9chuman-impact\xe2\x80\x9d markers. The ecological attributes of the plant species assigned to the pollen taxa provide an indirect link to specific environments (wetter/drier) that supported the land cover. The analyzed core revealed the vegetation history around the site during the past two centuries through pollen analyses supported by remote sensing. Even during this short period, distinct fluctuations in the vegetation assemblages were observed. Remote sensing indicates that the forest cover did not change significantly during the past \xe2\x88\xbc30 years. During this period there was also a change in the area covered by scrub and agriculture. Taken together and linked to the variations of the individual forest tree markers, this leads to the following story: a definitely drier period between ca. AD 1798 and AD 1846 and a definitely wetter one between ca. AD 1876 and AD 1920. The results from the RS and GIS show that while there was almost no change in the forest cover of the Potapuram Cheruvu watershed between 1973 and 2005, taking into account the tank's seasonality by analyzing the wet and dry seasons, there was a notable decrease in the forest cover between 1924 and 1973."

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Current study provides spatial information of intact forest landscapes of India.\xe2\x80\xa2About 5.4% of the total natural forest remained as intact in India.\xe2\x80\xa2The spatial database generated stands as scientific input for the identification of new protected areas.\xe2\x80\xa2The monitoring of changes in intact forest landscapes help in future conservation programs.AbstractThere is an increased interest in identifying the status of biodiversity in different spatial and temporal scales. The objective of the current research is to prepare a consistent spatial database of intact forest landscapes of India. The intact forest landscapes are located in the Himalayas, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Western Ghats and Sunderbans. At national level 237 forest landscapes and 5.4% of the total natural forest remained as intact in India. Current intact forest landscapes of India consists of blocks larger than 10\xc2\xa0km2 covering an area of 34,061\xc2\xa0km2. Of the total area under intact forest landscapes, Eastern Himalayas represent 76.7% of the area, followed by Western Himalayas (8.8%), Andaman & Nicobar Islands (6.2%) and Western Ghats (5.7%). The largest intact forest landscape block occupies an area of 3342.9\xc2\xa0km2 (9.8%) is found in western Arunachal Pradesh. Temperate forest zone represents the highest intactness (56.6%), followed by subtropical zone (19.2%), tropical zone (18.6%) and alpine zone (5.6%). Himalayan moist temperate forests represent the highest area (39.1%) of intact forest landscapes followed by subtropical broad-leaved hill forests, wet evergreen forests, and montane wet temperate forests. It is estimated that 4.4% of the area of intact forest landscapes fall inside the existing 47 protected areas. The results of the analysis best suited as input for the process of identification of new protected areas. The study recommends fine-scale mapping of biodiversity within the intact forest landscapes and to prepare efficient conservation plans.'

Abstract: 'AbstractMost of the world\xe2\x80\x99s remaining terrestrial biodiversity exists in tropical ecosystems affected by human activities. Despite the threats to seasonally dry tropical ecosystems, little is known about the impact of human land use change on their conservation value. We used savanna woodlands within the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot as a case study to understand the effects of human land use on plant diversity. We investigated the effects of three common land-use activities \xe2\x80\x93 biomass extraction, livestock grazing and ground fire \xe2\x80\x93 on species richness and diversity, as well as species composition in terms of the breadth of geographic ranges of species present. We found that total species richness increased with livestock grazing due to increased understory richness. Overstory diversity and tree sapling diversity and richness decreased with more recent fire. Greater canopy openness was associated with increased understory richness and reduced overstory richness. The combination of fire and livestock grazing are likely to increase canopy openness, leading to a shift in diversity from the overstory to the understory. Although we found no change in species richness or diversity with biomass extraction, areas with biomass extraction had more widely distributed species and fewer narrowly distributed species, indicating land use may lead to biotic homogenization. Our results suggest that a mosaic of protected areas along with areas managed for biomass extraction and livestock grazing would be an effective way to balance the conservation of plant diversity with local communities\xe2\x80\x99 needs while maintaining overall levels of plant species diversity in these savanna woodlands.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba We assessed the effects of moderate land use on savanna woodlands in South India. \xe2\x96\xba Moderate land use maintained overall plant diversity and species richness. \xe2\x96\xba Fire and livestock grazing shifted diversity from the overstory to the understory. \xe2\x96\xba Areas with biomass extraction had more common and fewer rare species. \xe2\x96\xba A mosaic of land uses could balance local needs with biodiversity conservation.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Altitude decrease liana diversity while patch size increases.\xe2\x80\xa2Disturbance alters liana diversity responses.\xe2\x80\xa2Lianas play a vital role in montane forest succession.AbstractThe species richness and density of lianas (woody vines) in tropical forests is determined by various abiotic and biotic factors. Factors such as altitude, forest patch size and the degree of forest disturbance are known to exert strong influences on liana species richness and density. We investigated how liana species richness and density were concurrently influenced by altitude (1700\xe2\x80\x932360\xc2\xa0m), forest patch size, forest patch location (edge or interior) and disturbance intensity in the tropical montane evergreen forests, of the Nilgiri and Palni hills, Western Ghats, southern India. All woody lianas (\xe2\x89\xa51\xc2\xa0cm dbh) were enumerated in plots of 30\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa030\xc2\xa0m in small, medium and large forest patches, which were located along an altitudinal gradient ranging from 1700 to 2360\xc2\xa0m. A total of 1980 individual lianas were recorded, belonging to 45 species, 32 genera and 21 families, from a total sampling area of 13.86\xc2\xa0ha (across 154 plots). Liana species richness and density decreased significantly with increasing altitude and increased with increasing forest patch size. Within forest patches, the proportion of forest edge or interior habitat influenced liana distribution and succession especially when compared across the patch size categories. Liana species richness and density also varied along the altitudinal gradient when examined using eco-physiological guilds (i.e. shade tolerance, dispersal mode and climbing mechanism). The species richness and density of lianas within these ecological guilds responded negatively to increasing altitude and positively to increasing patch size and additionally displayed differing sensitivities to forest disturbance. Importantly, the degree of forest disturbance significantly altered the relationship between liana species richness and density to increasing altitude and patches size, and as such is likely the primary influence on liana response to montane forest succession. Our findings suggest that managing forest disturbance in the examined montane forests would assist in conserving local liana diversity across the examined altitudinal range.'

Title: 'Diversity and ecology of lianas in tropical dry evergreen forests on the Coromandel Coast of India under various disturbance regimes'

Abstract: 'AbstractIn this study we attempted to explore patterns of diversity, abundance, climbing and dispersal mode of lianas in relation to disturbance in 40 Indian subtropical dry forests. The sites were selected to represent four disturbance categories: relatively undisturbed, moderately disturbed, much disturbed and heavily disturbed. All lianas \xe2\x89\xa51\xc2\xa0cm dbh were counted, which resulted in a total amount of 5689 individuals of lianas, representing 77 species in 62 genera and 32 families. Liana species richness and abundance increased with forest disturbance, but the liana basal area values showed an opposite trend, with high scores in undisturbed sites. Twining was the main climbing mechanism (61.3%) and zoochory (59.6%) was the main dispersal mode in all the four forest categories. Application of Bray\xe2\x80\x93Curtis cluster analysis produced three distinct clusters in which the much disturbed category was more distant from the others. High abundance of large lianas in undisturbed sites and that of the invasive Lantana camara in heavily disturbed site signals the conservation significance of the less disturbed study sites. The predominance of zoochorous dispersal indicates the faunal dependence of lianas, besides of host trees, thus underlining the need for a holistic approach in biodiversity conservation of this and similar tropical forests.'

Abstract: 'AbstractWater is essential for all living beings. It is a major concern to provide water to all. It is a challenge to supply water to all major cities in Dakshina Kannada district, Karnataka, India. Nethravathi River is one of the major sources of water in the region which yields about 1240TMC per year. Nethravathi River has its origins in Western Ghats of Karnataka flowing to a length of 126 Km and joins Arabian Sea. In Dakshina Kannada district all major cities face water scarcity in summer season even after getting an average annual rainfall of 3.75 \xe2\x80\x93 4.25 m. It is a major challenge to the district administration for providing required water to the people during summer season in spite of plenty of water available during monsoon. This paper highlights in giving solution to this issue after studying various parameters like geographical structure, rainfall data and climate, study of catchment area, storage methods, water demand and water supply schemes available in the region. An attempt has been made to suggest for supplying the water to the cities in Dakshina Kannada district by increasing the storage capacity on the upstream side of the river to get water round the clock.'

Title: 'Ecology and management of sacred groves in Kerala, India'

Abstract: "AbstractIn Kerala, based on management systems, sacred groves can be categorised into three groups namely those managed by individual families, by groups of families and by the statutory agencies for temple management (Devaswom Board). Ollur Kavu, S.N. Puram Kavu and Iringole Kavu which represent above mentioned management systems, respectively, were studied for their tree species composition and vegetation structure. The study was also designed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of present management systems and role of different stakeholder groups in conserving the sacred groves. Of the three sacred groves, the one managed by individual family (Ollur Kavu) is highly disturbed as indicated by low stem density of mature trees (367\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) and poor regeneration potential with the ratio between mature trees and saplings is 1:0.4. In order to quantify the level of disturbance in these sacred groves, Ramakrishnan index of stand quality (RISQ) was calculated. The values obtained for all the three tree layers (i.e., mature trees, saplings and seedlings) in single family managed sacred grove (Ollur Kavu) was between 2.265 and 2.731, an indicator of the dominance of light demanding species in the population, suggested that the grove is highly disturbed one. Whereas, other two sacred groves are less disturbed as indicated by lower `RISQ' values (between 1.319 and 1.648). Iringole Kavu and S.N. Puram Kavu were compared with some other evergreen forests of the Western Ghats of India for the parameters like stem density, basal area and species diversity of trees (gbh\xe2\x89\xa510.1\xc2\xa0cm). Values obtained for these parameters in the two sacred groves are within the range obtained for other forests. Stakeholder importance value index (SIVI) was calculated based on the attributes like the proximity of the stakeholder to the sacred grove, contribution of stakeholders in managing the sacred grove, benefits being enjoyed by the stakeholder due to involvement with sacred grove and attitude of the stakeholder group towards the conservation and management of sacred grove. This indicated that local people, temple trust and/ or sacred grove owners are the major stakeholders, while in general some other stakeholder groups such as youth clubs, schools, forest department, municipality and local Panchayat with lower SIVI are comparatively neutral in conserving and managing the groves. Some of the major strategies to be adopted are self-imposed complete ban on the removal of biomass for the revitalisation of ecosystem, creation of awareness among local people and all stakeholder groups, identification of the type of contribution a stakeholder group can offer in managing the sacred grove and encouragement of all stakeholders to participate without either directly or indirectly adversely affecting the ecosystem as well as the wisdom and interest of the major stakeholder groups."

Abstract: 'AbstractKyasanur forest disease (KFD) is a zoonotic viral haemorrhagic fever and has been endemic to Karnataka State, India. Outbreaks of KFD were reported in new areas of Wayanad and Malappuram districts of Kerala, India during 2014\xe2\x80\x932015. Investigation of the outbreaks was carried out in these districts during May 2015. The line-list data of KFD cases available with District Medical Office, Wayanad were analysed. Case investigation was carried out to determine the risk factors associated with the outbreak and possible site of contraction infections. Ticks from the forest floor were collected in areas associated with monkey deaths by flagging method to estimate species abundance. Of 102 confirmed cases of KFD reported in Wayanad, 91% were adults aged >15years. About 43% of the cases were from the areas of Poothady Primary Health Centre (PHC) followed by Chethalayam PHC (22%). Most of the affected individuals belong to Kattunayakan tribe, dependent on forest for their livelihood. Those tribes are engaged in trench digging and fire line works in summer months and hence are at a higher risk. In Malappuram, the Cholanaickan tribe, are under high risk of exposure to infected ticks as they live deep in the forest and trap monkeys for game meat. High abundance of Haemaphysalis spinigera and H. turturis, the established vectors of KFD virus was recorded in all affected areas. Incidence of KFD cases/monkey deaths and high abundance of Haemaphysalis vectors in the forest ranges of Wayanad and Malappuram districts indicate that the area has become receptive for KFD outbreaks. Preventive measures (vaccination of high risk groups) coupled with intensive health education should be carried out prior to transmission season.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIn tropical forest conservation, areas with full statutory protection are often surrounded by buffer zones. Information on the patterns of tree community structure differences in these zones is helpful to evaluate the conservation efficacy. Our study was implemented within a biodiversity hotspot, in the Ta Xua Nature Reserve of north-western Vietnam, which has a statutorily protected core zone and a buffer zone, where local H\xe2\x80\x99Mong people are permitted low intensity forest use. The forests are rich in tree species (249 observed). Many of these tree species provide non-timber forest products (NTFPs) (48%) or valuable timber (22%), and 18 species are red-listed. Overall tree density was not different in the two zones, but tree diameter and species richness were lower in the buffer zone. At the tree level, logistic regression analysis indicated that red-listed status, large diameter, and low density of conspecifics increased the probability of tree absence from the buffer zone but not the potential use as a NTFP. However, most NTFP species had different densities in the core and buffer zones, and this correlated with signs of human interference. At the species level, the density of species was the most important variable, and rarity strongly increased the probability of species absence. Our results also indicate that rare and red-listed trees were depleted in the buffer zone. In consideration of conservation goals, the future monitoring of these species at the Ta Xua Nature Reserve and other protected areas is needed, and conservation measures most likely need to be improved.'

Title: 'Assessing the extent and causes of forest degradation in India: Where do we stand?'
Author: 'Priya'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632071000176X
Abstract: 'AbstractIn India, conservation of biodiversity goes hand in hand with human welfare, as millions of people live adjacent or within protected areas and depend upon forests products. The high density and biomass requirements of these households could result in the degradation of forests and loss of biodiversity. We assessed the collection of forest products among households in five sites in the Western and Eastern Ghats of peninsular India: the Kogar region of the Central Western Ghats, the Bandipur and Sigur regions of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the Kalakad\xe2\x80\x93Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve of the southern Western Ghats and Similipal Tiger Reserve of the northern Eastern Ghats, and tested whether extraction pressure on forests was associated with the proportion of agricultural households, wage labour and population density. We also examined whether data on loss of cover as stated by the State of the Forest Reports was supported by field data. The regions differed in land use: Kogar, KMTR and Similipal were primarily agricultural regions, whereas households engaged in wage labour or in running small businesses were predominant in Sigur and Bandipur. Fuel\xe2\x80\x93wood was collected ubiquitously for household use in all sites, used mainly for domestic requirements and secondarily for generating income. Green leaves for making fertilizer and fodder were collected for household use and did not enter the market. Cattle manure for the global organic coffee industry was a major forest product in Bandipur and Sigur. Extraction pressure on forests was positively associated with the availability of wage labour and was negatively with the proportion of agricultural households. Data from official sources seem inadequate to measure forest degradation in protected forests. Accurate estimation of forest condition through field assessments and remote sensing, and understanding the socio-economic variables associated with forest loss and degradation are needed for the sustainable management of Indian protected areas.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Two endemic species from Western Ghats, A. hohenackeri and A. bonaccordensis, were compared to trace their origin.\xe2\x80\xa2The chromosome number in both were 2n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa026.\xe2\x80\xa2Based on Stebbins classification A. bonaccordensis was advanced.\xe2\x80\xa2The mitotic and meiotic abnormalities indicate occurrence of translocations in A. bonaccordensis.\xe2\x80\xa2The ISSR analysis revealed more unique bands in A. bonaccordensis substantiating chromosomal rearrangements and high mutation of the SSR loci.AbstractIn present study we have made an attempt to trace possible lines in the evolution of A. bonaccordensis separating from A. hohenackeri, where translocations at the chromosomal level could have resulted in a shift of the habitat during evolution of A. bonaccordensis. This species is occurring as an endemic taxon at a higher altitude than it may have been the case with its ancestor that occupied lower altitudes and possibly a broader ecological niche. Morphological and physiological differences between the recent two closely related taxa, in spadix and appendix characters, corm flesh colour, pollen morphology and oxalate content, may be attributed also to the translocation at the cytological level. Detailed karyotype studies have been done in these Amorphophallus species from Southern Western Ghats, where they are critically endangered in their habitats, indicating that the chromosome number in both species is 2n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa026. In both of them there is a considerable variation in the karyotype symmetry. Accordingly, A. hohenackeri is placed under 2B whereas A. bonaccordensis fits well to 3B category of Stebbins\xe2\x80\x99 classification. The highly endemic species Amorphophallus bonaccordensis, known only from the type locality, is supposed to have originated from A. hohenackeri via many cycles of translocations resulting in heteromorphic, nearly telocentric chromosomes, peculiar satellites, and many mitotic abnormalities like bridges, laggards, micronuclei and heteromorpic bivalents, terminalised chiasmata, supernumerary chromosomes and multinucleate cells at meiosis. ISSR analysis with 17 ISSR primers revealed a higher number of unique bands in A. bonaccordensis. Also the ISSR data, when correlated with the karyotype data, indicate that A. bonaccordensis has probably originated from A. hohenackeri due to chromosomal rearrangements and high mutation of the SSR loci.'

Abstract: 'AbstractSince its original description, the Indian treefrog species Polypedates variabilis Jerdon, 1853 has been assigned variously to one of the widespread genera Polypedates Tschudi, 1832, Rhacophorus Kuhl & van Hasselt, 1822, and Philautus (Kirtixalus) Dubois, 1987. Here we present phylogenetic analyses based on 1.4\xc2\xa0kb of mitochondrial DNA showing that P. variabilis and a previously undescribed relative are not nested within any of those genera, but stem from a lineage that originated relatively early in the rhacophorid radiation. We propose the name Ghatixalus gen. n. for this lineage, whose known members are restricted to high altitudes in the Western Ghats of India. The sister species of G. variabilis (Jerdon), comb. n. is described as Ghatixalus asterops sp. n. The morphological and ecological features of both species are discussed.'

Title: 'Patterns of liana diversity in tropical evergreen forests of peninsular India'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe quantitative liana inventories made in five peninsular Indian independent forest sites, distributed in the Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats and on the Coromandel coast, were examined particularly with reference to site altitude and forest stature. Liana diversity totaled 148 species in 101 genera of 47 families, in a total sample of 47\xc2\xa0ha. The coefficient of variability in species distribution among the five sites was used to identify an oligarchy in liana species by taking 55 abundant species from the species pool. Ordination analysis, based on presence\xe2\x80\x93absence as well as relative density of liana species indicated a geographical differentiation among the five sites in both the ordinations with respect to site altitude. Liana density (stems>1.6\xc2\xa0cm diameter) decreased with increasing altitude, whereas richness was highest at intermediate elevations. The mean liana density across the forest sites showed a weak negative correlation with forest stature. The lianas encountered in the five study sites fell under six climber types, of which twining was the chief climbing mechanism, both in terms of species diversity and density, and tendril climbers were more abundant in dry evergreen forests than in the wet evergreen forests. In liana diaspore dispersal modes, the majority of evergreen forest species possessed animal dispersal guilds, whereas wind-dispersal was prevalent in semi-evergreen and dry evergreen forests.'

Abstract: 'AbstractFour-horned antelope is one of the smallest Asian bovids, endemic to India and Nepal. Despite its wide distribution in India, the species has received very little scientific attention. We studied its habitat preference, activity budget, diet, social behaviour and breeding in Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary. Among tropical dry deciduous and thorn forests, where the species is distributed, higher abundance was observed in dry deciduous areas (0.26 individuals/km, 95% CI\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.22\xe2\x80\x930.29) especially the short grass habitat associated with stunted and sparse tree growth known as \xe2\x80\x98tree-savanna\xe2\x80\x99 than the dry thorn forest (0.09 individuals/km, CI\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.001\xe2\x80\x930.18). The antelopes follow a bimodal feeding pattern with 52% morning (06:00\xe2\x80\x9310:00\xc2\xa0h) and 65% evening (14:00\xe2\x80\x9318:00\xc2\xa0h) devoted to feeding. Diet was studied by analyzing 59 pellets collected from two major habitat types during the dry season. Of the 52% of the diet components identified, grass (28.6%, 14 species) and browse biomass (23.3%, 10 species; with five herbs (9.6%), one shrub (5.6%) and leaves and fruits from four trees (8.2%)) constituted equal parts indicating a mixed feeder category. Mean group size of 1.5 (\xc2\xb10.71 SD range: 1\xe2\x80\x934) individuals estimated from 94 direct sightings with solitary individuals (62%) and adult with fawn/s (11%) constituting over 70% of the sightings indicating a non-herding nature of the species. Newborns were sighted from February to May with a peak during April and the reported gestation period of c. 8 months suggests mating taking place during June\xe2\x80\x93August. Mean litter size was 1.6 (\xc2\xb10.53 SD, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa09). The study suggests the need for including dry thorn forest habitats of Sigur plateau in the existing protected areas and detailed studies for long-term conservation of the species in this region.'

Title: 'Geomorphic context of two acheulian sites in semi-arid peninsular India: Inferring palaeoenvironment and chronology'
Author: 'Sushama G.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618216302208
Abstract: 'AbstractOver the last 30 years, research in Acheulian culture in India has undergone drastic changes to incorporate an understanding of chronological and environmental aspects. This is largely attributed to the increasing role of multi-disciplinary approaches at excavated sites like Singi Talav, Didwana in Thar desert, Morgaon in Western Upland Maharashtra, Isampur in Northern Karnataka, and Attirampakkam in coastal Tamilnadu. Of these, Attirampakkam is the only site firmly dated to 1.5Ma. Despite attempts to date these sites to the early Pleistocene (older than 0.8\xc2\xa0Ma), the application of absolute dating techniques in the Indian sub-continent has proved challenging due to inherent technical problems. Climatically, the early Pleistocene appears to be wetter than the middle Pleistocene, while the late Pleistocene was distinctly arid. Against this chronological and palaeoclimatic backdrop, an attempt has been made to reinvestigate Acheulian sites at Gangapur, in Upland Maharashtra (Deccan Trap formation) and Anagwadi in northern Karnataka (Kaladgi formation) by using two important geomorphic proxies namely ferricrete and calcrete associated with Acheulian artefacts. These studies show that both sites are connected with palaeochannels, flowing close to modern channels of the Godavari and the Ghataprabha. Ferricritised Acheulian artefact-bearing conglomerate is totally relict in the present semi-arid climate which has prevailed since the early middle Pleistocene in peninsular India. The Acheulian site at Anagwadi, therefore, appears to belong to the early Pleistocene. The site of Gangapur is in conformity with a semi-arid climate and therefore belongs to the middle Pleistocene. These sites represent an adaptation of Acheulian hominin groups to humid (at Anagwadi) and semi-arid environments (at Gangapur) during the early and middle Pleistocene age. The Acheulian artefacts are made on locally available quartzite at Anagwadi, and basalt at Gangapur.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe tropical rainforest in the south-western Ghats of Kerala State was surveyed in May 1993 with the help of trained volunteers and Forest department staff to assess the status and distribution of the endangered lion-tailed macaque Macaca silenus. A total of 564 macaques in 64 troops were sighted during the survey. It is estimated that the number of lion-tailed macaques in Kerala is a minimum of 1216 but only three areas are identified as having viable populations with long-term conservation prospects. Most sightings of troops were in Protected Areas. The present survey indicates its absence in the ranges reported earlier, such as Cardamom Hills and South Wayanad. Maintenance of existing contiguous patches of evergreen forest and inclusion of suitable management strategies in Working Plans for non-Protected Areas are suggested.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2LULC change of a forest and surrounding area was observed for 1978\xe2\x80\x932016.\xe2\x80\xa2There was reduction in forest coverage while increase in cultivated lands.\xe2\x80\xa2Modelling predicted continuation of similar trends in future for all LULC classes.\xe2\x80\xa2Human intervention and agricultural intensification caused the forest degradationAbstractThe northern part of West Bengal, India partially falls within the Terai region of Himalaya. This region is distinctive in terms of high forest cover and rich biodiversity, but also features increasing human population, agricultural practices, and subsequent human-wildlife conflict. This study evaluated the impact of anthropogenic and agricultural proliferation on land use and land cover (LULC) transition dynamics of a forest and its surrounding area of this region. Jaldapara National Park along with its neighbouring region represents an ideal example of such ecology and thus was chosen as the study area. Satellite remote sensing was used to overcome accessibility issues in areas of protected forest and model future possible LULC of the area. Results indicated a continuous decrease in dense forest from 1978 to 2016. Modelling predicted a continuation of the same trend through 2050. The total area under forest increased from 1978 to 2001, possibly due to declaration of a part of the forest as a wildlife sanctuary in 1976 and subsequent increase in supervision and surveillance. However, total forest area started to decline from 2001 and future reductions are possible. Cultivated lands increased from 1978 to 2016 and additional future increase is likely due to a commensurate surge in human population in areas adjacent to the forest. In sum, increasing population pressure, agricultural production demands, and high human intervention in forest ecology were identified as possible causes of temporal forest degradation.'

Abstract: 'AbstractA multi-proxy study was carried out to address climate\xe2\x80\x93culture relationship from two trenches one each from Kaj and Kanjetar (mid-Saurashtra coast) deposited in a lacustrine setting, since \xe2\x88\xbc1960\xc2\xa0Cal\xc2\xa0BC and \xe2\x88\xbc2230\xc2\xa0Cal\xc2\xa0BC, respectively. The salinity of aqueous soil solution (0.1\xc2\xa0ppt) and fresh water thecamoebians in both the sites indicate fresh water depositional environment. But, an increase in salinity (0.2\xc2\xa0ppt) in the top clayey sediment in Kanjetar is attributed to water evaporation through upward capillary action from moisture deficit exposed land. The fragments of ancient potteries and other artefacts recovered from the bottom sediment provide evidences of Sorath-Harappan colonization in the vicinity which was not an urban site. The abundant cyanobacterium remains, low terrigenous organic matter, aquatic pollen and low thecamoebians in bottom sediment indicates low precipitation and arid climatic conditions \xe2\x88\xbc2000\xc2\xa0BC. During this period the dominance of evergreen and moist deciduous arboreals from both the sites do not show equilibrium with the prevailing dry/arid climate and therefore, the pollen assemblage here represents the remnants of wetter middle Holocene vegetation in the region.

Abstract: 'AbstractThe occurrence and abundance of five species of arboreal mammals in 25 rain forest fragments ranging from <1 ha to 2500 ha in area in the Anamalai Hills in south India, were examined in relation to several habitat and landscape variables. The lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus) was the most affected, being absent from 15 fragments while the Nilgiri langur (Trachypithecus johnii) was absent from six and the Malabar giant squirrel (Ratufa indica) from only three fragments. The densities of the giant squirrel, the large brown flying squirrel (Petaurista petaurista) and the Travancore flying squirrel (Petinomys fuscocapillus) increased with decreasing area and increasing disturbance level. In logistic regression, canopy height and tree density were the best predictors of the occurrence of the lion-tailed macaque and the Nilgiri langur, respectively. Area of the fragment may be an important predictor of occurrence of these species only when the fragments are very small. Once initially present, their continued occurrence is better predicted by habitat variation, consistent with the ecology of the species. It is possible to retain the arboreal mammals in the rain forest fragments through improving habitat quality. The suggested measures include (a) prevention of degradation due to lopping and felling of trees; (b) assisted regeneration in forest fragments; and (c) retention of orchards of jack fruit trees (Artocarpus integrifolia), guava (Psidium guajava), etc., in the labour settlements around the fragments. Land use policies that would prevent conversion of cardamom plantations into tea or coffee plantations are also needed.'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We describe the experiences of ATREE, a non-government environment think tank in India, in implementing its sustainability science programme.\xe2\x80\xa2During its 20 year history, the organization has achieved considerable success in generating interdisciplinary knowledge.\xe2\x80\xa2Despite success, a number of hurdles remain in fostering integration of concepts and approaches across disciplines.\xe2\x80\xa2ATREE's experience offers important insights to the conceptualization and implementation of sustainability science for other organizations.Rapidly accelerating local and global environmental change threatens societal well-being now and in the future in a variety of ways, especially in developing countries. A necessary condition for responding adequately to this environmental crisis is the generation of knowledge that speaks to policy and action, and is holistic, not fragmented along disciplinary lines. The idea of interdisciplinary applied research on the environment has been around since the early 1970s and has taken different institutional forms and labels. In developing countries such as India, the academic community has generally \xe2\x80\x98disciplined\xe2\x80\x99 environmental pedagogy into environmental \xe2\x80\x98science\xe2\x80\x99 programs, and academic research also continues largely on disciplinary lines. We review the experience of the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bangalore, India, that was set up almost two decades ago as an effort to institutionalize an interdisciplinary and problem-oriented research and teaching paradigm. One key element of this effort has been an explicitly normative but broad set of concerns, including equity and democratic governance as integral aspects of conservation and sustainability. Another has been an emphasis on balancing academic rigor with social relevance, the latter achieved not just by speaking to policy makers, but by building collaborations with local communities and activist groups in a number of field sites. Finally, building an explicitly interdisciplinary PhD programme in spite of significant resource and other constraints has built a common perspective. In our analysis, we highlight factors that influence success, including clarity and a common understanding of the mission, human resources, resolution of perennial tensions between disciplinary and interdisciplinary work, commitment to the program structure, program and institutional leadership, and the framework for rewards and incentives. Availability of resources, political support, and the willingness of the state to accept and recognize the work of non-state actors are other major factors. ATREE's experience offers important insights to the conceptualization and implementation of sustainability studies programs elsewhere."

The North China Terrane, the Alxa Terrane and the Qilian Orogenic Belt were not the provenances of the Xiangshan Group. The age spectrum of the Xiangshan Group is similar to terranes associated with eastern Gondwana.

Abstract: 'AbstractForest fragmentation is considered as one of the major conservation issue. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the national assessment of spatial patterns of forest fragmentation and influence of deforestation on fragmentation in the Indian forests during three decade interval (1975-2005). Mapping of forest cover was carried out based on Landsat MSS and IRS P6 AWiFS data using hybrid classification techniques on 1:250,000 scale. The present study considered biogeographic zones as a major stratum for national level assessment. The forest fragmentation was analysed based on landscape indices which allow quantification and categorisation of complex forest landscapes and depict landscape composition, structure and scenario of fragmentation. The analysis revealed that in all biogeographic zones, more than 90% of total number of forest fragments consists of patches having area less than 1\xc2\xa0km2. At national level the mean forest patch size stands at 187\xc2\xa0ha. The total core area was highest for Islands (87.4%) followed by Eastern Himalayas (82.5%), Deccan (78.9%), Deserts (76.4%) and Eastern Ghats (76%). The temporal analysis shows that the loss of Indian forest area as 5.8% during 1975\xe2\x80\x932005. The annual rate of deforestation has been computed as 0.20% at national level. The decreased mean patch size, increased edge density and increased number of patches from 1975 to 2005 indicates ongoing fragmentation in biogeographic zones. The very high fragmentation in Trans Himalayas is contributed mostly by the natural factors while in other biogeographic zones, increased fragmentation is due to deforestation.'

Abstract: 'AbstractCamptothecin and 10-hydroxycamptothecin are two important precursors for the synthesis of the clinically useful anticancer drugs, topotecan and irinotecan. In recent years, efforts have been made to identify novel plant and endophytic fungal sources of camptothecin and 10-hydroxycamptothecin. In this study we have isolated endophytic fungi strains from Apodytes dimidiata (Icacinaceae), a medium sized tree from the Western Ghats, India. The fungi were identified as Fusarium solani using both ITS rDNA sequencing and spore morphology. Two strains, MTCC 9667 and MTCC 9668 were isolated, both of which produced camptothecin and 9-methoxycamptothecin in their mycelia; one of the strains, MTCC 9668 also produced 10-hydroxycamptothecin, though in small amounts.

Abstract: 'AbstractCamptothecine (CPT), a quinoline alkaloid, is a potent inhibitor of eukaryotic topoisomerase I. Because of this activity, several semi-synthetic derivatives of CPT are in clinical use against ovarian and small lung cancers. Together with its derivatives, CPT is the third largest anti-cancer drug in the world market. CPT is produced by several plant species belonging to the Asterid clade. In the recent past, several studies have reported the production of CPT by endophytic fungal associates of some of these plant species. In this paper, we report the production of CPT by endophytic bacteria isolated from Miquelia dentata Bedd. (Icacinaceae). Besides CPT, the bacteria also produced 9-methoxy CPT (9-MeO-CPT), in culture, independent of the host tissue. The chemical nature of CPT and 9-MeO-CPT was determined by LC\xe2\x80\x93MS and ESI-MS/MS analysis, and was shown to be similar to that produced by the host tissue. One of the bacterial isolates examined, showed indications of attenuation of CPT production through sub-culture. This is the first report of production of CPT by endophytic bacteria. The identity of the bacteria was ascertained by Gram staining and 16s rRNA sequencing. We discuss the possible mechanisms that might be involved in the synthesis of CPT by endophytic bacteria.'

Abstract: 'AbstractCalamus thwaitesii Becc. is a potentially useful rattan found in the Western Ghats of India and Sri Lanka. The wild stock of this rattan species is greatly diminished due to overexploitation for the furniture industry and increasingly rare. Genetic diversity was estimated in 80 samples representing eight populations from the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. RAPDs generated a total of 120 markers with 10 decamer primers, of which 85% were found to be polymorphic. The percentage of polymorphic loci varied from 40.00 to 60.83 and genetic distance between populations ranged from 0.0332 to 0.2777. Among the analysed populations, Goa was found to be genetically superior followed by Achenkovil, Sinharaja and Talakkaveri. Majority of the genetic diversity was distributed within populations (70.79%) and only (29.21%) among populations. Genetic relationships estimated by the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averaging (UPGMA) cluster analysis and principal co-ordinate analysis failed to separate Indian and Sri Lankan populations geographically into two distinct groups.'

This has contributed to the current knowledge of the landscape in association with the flora and megalith culture that prevailed in South India during the Early Historic time at 540\xe2\x80\x93410\xc2\xa0cal BCE. Evidence shows that Early Historic megalith people engaged less in pastoral activities on the open landscape, dominated by herbs e.g., Cyperaceae and Poaceae, and also by Palmae species in semi-arid environment. The presence of strong mode of settled-paddy and millet farming cultures, cereal-processing activities and grazing in association with the burial practices were significant as early as 6th century BCE. Seeds, leaves and sheath from domesticated rice, millet and some materials from sedges and Palmae species were deliberately deposited indicating variable burial rituals in each grave. Burial tradition indicates that Iron Age and Early Historic megalithic people of southern India may have carried out burial rituals with more rice than millets. Evidence for the early appearance of Brahmi writing as part of the \xe2\x80\x98complex\xe2\x80\x99 megalith social life marks the beginning of Early Historic Period, previously not reported in southern Asia. Phytolith evidence also provides new insight into the transformation of urban-fringe landscapes with possible irrigated agriculture in those broad ecological and cultural contexts.'

Such information is essential in designing effective strategies for biodiversity conservation and management. Remote sensing is one of the most powerful approaches to identify biodiversity hotspots and predict changes in species composition in reduced time and costs. This is because, with respect to field-based methods, it allows to derive complete spatial coverages of the Earth surface under study in a short period of time. Furthermore, remote sensing provides repeated coverages of field sites, thus making studies of temporal changes in biodiversity possible. In this paper we discuss, from a conceptual point of view, the potential of remote sensing in estimating biodiversity using various diversity indices, including alpha- and beta-diversity measurements.'

Abstract: "AbstractThe paleoclimatology and paleoecology of the early Weichselian flora (115-75 ka B.P.) of Gr\xc3\xb6bern (Germany) is reconstructed. This analysis is based on the macrofossil record and the general recent distribution of the extant taxa. The Herning stadial and the Rederstall stadial were marked by a (sub)oceanic climate type and a relatively smooth annual course of the monthly main temperatures. Both stadials were very similar in terms of their monthly temperatures, but during the Rederstall stadial the summer temperatures were slightly colder. In contrast to the woodless stadials, the interstadials were marked by the presence of boreal coniferous forests. The flora of the Br\xc3\xb8rup interstadial and the Odderade interstadial were only slightly different. They were characterised by a subcontinental climate. The annual amplitude of the temperature was greater than in the stadials: the summer temperatures were higher and the winter temperatures considerably lower. Valuable information is presented from the analysis of the thermal resources of the vegetation periods. These data are especially important for the interpretation of the temperature diagrams provided. Trends of the climate's humidity are also discussed."

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper follows the discipline of Urban Design to elaborate the concepts of disaster resilience at the neighbourhood level for the collective development of Chennai city. The increased inflow and use of resources attributed to the growing urban population creates a pressure on the various natural systems, increasing their vulnerability to multiple attacks from natural and man-made forces. Hence the future adaptability of cities is important for its growth in the aftermath of a disaster strike. The intent of this research is thus to develop a framework of strategies for an emergency response programme and to develop a design scheme to make cities resilient, through neighbourhood development. A sample precinct of Chepauk was taken up for the design demonstration after a detailed analysis of the same, addressing various physical factors such as land use, open spaces, connectivity networks, physical and social infrastructure, built density, ecology and emergency response mechanism.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Buddha Pushkar assemblages fit with South Asian Late Palaeolithic technologies\xe2\x80\xa2Two groups of sites can be split between early and late MIS 2.\xe2\x80\xa2Behavioural diversity structured by raw material and reduction strategy choices\xe2\x80\xa2Elements of continuity from regional Middle Palaeolithic technologies\xe2\x80\xa2West India supports regionalised mosaic of South Asia Late Palaeolithic technology.AbstractThe terminology used to describe Palaeolithic industries has an important impact upon our interpretation of past behaviour. In South Asia, the term Late Palaeolithic is employed to refer to Late Pleistocene microlithic industries, distinguishing them chronologically from Holocene Mesolithic industries, and technologically from preceding Middle Palaeolithic technologies. Historically, however, an intermediate technological stage between Middle Palaeolithic and microlithic industries has been recognised and called \xe2\x80\x98Upper\xe2\x80\x99 Palaeolithic. Examining whether these \xe2\x80\x98Upper\xe2\x80\x99 Palaeolithic industries fit contemporary definitions of Middle or Late Palaeolithic technologies, distinct diversity within one of these technologies or a transitional phase between the two is therefore necessary to reintegrate these \xe2\x80\x98Upper\xe2\x80\x99 Palaeolithic sites into current debate. This is a particularly timely issue as the connection between some Late Palaeolithic artefact types, particularly backed microliths, and the earliest modern human populations in South Asia no longer appears tenable, and thus a rush to identify the earliest appearance of microliths must give way to more detailed examinations of behavioural variability. This paper re-examines lithic assemblages from Buddha Pushkar, western India, originally reported as an \xe2\x80\x98Upper\xe2\x80\x99 Palaeolithic industry. An attribute study of metric and categorical variables recorded on stone tools is used to examine how flaking technology, raw material use and reduction intensity vary within and between these assemblages. The results indicate raw material choices had a marked impact on stone tool technologies, nested within a pattern of technological diversity in western India during the terminal Pleistocene that complement models of regional trajectories in the evolution of Late Palaeolithic technologies.'

Title: 'Opposite trends in response for the Shannon and Simpson indices of landscape diversity'
Author: 'Harini'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622802000024
Abstract: 'AbstractAmong the most popular of metrics used to quantify landscape composition are Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s index, believed to emphasize the richness component of diversity, and Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s index, emphasizing the evenness component. These indices can show considerable variation in response to changes in landscape richness and evenness. However, the possibility of encountering opposite trends in the responses of these indices to assemblages that differ in only a single component of diversity has not been sufficiently acknowledged. An opposite response of these indices was observed for two Indian landscapes with the same richness, differing only in evenness. Using a numerical simulation, the likelihood of encountering landscapes with an opposite response was demonstrated to increase with increasing richness, from about 4% for landscapes consisting of three cover types, to about 6% for ten types. This emphasizes the need for caution when choosing an index of landscape diversity. Rare cover types provide habitats for sensitive species and facilitate critical ecological processes. The Shannon index, sensitive to their presence, is therefore recommended for landscape management within an ecological framework. Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s index, more responsive to the dominant cover type, can be used for specific situations where the dominant cover type is of interest, such as single-species reserve design.'

Title: 'Ethnobotany of dioecious species: Traditional knowledge on dioecious plants in India'
Author: 'Gopalakrishnan Saroja'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037887411830206X
Abstract: 'AbstractEthnopharmacological relevanceMore than 15,000 angiosperm species are dioecious, i.e., having distinct male and female individual plants. The allocation of resources between male and female plants is different, and also variation in secondary metabolites and sex-biased herbivory is reported among dioecious plants. However, little is known about the ethnobotany of dioecious species and whether preferences exist for a specific gender, e.g., in food, medicine or timber.Aim of the studyThe aim of this study was: 1) to study whether Indian folk healers have preference for plant genders, and to document their knowledge and use of dioecious species; 2) to understand the concept of plant gender in Indian systems of medicine and folk medicine, and whether Ayurvedic literature includes any references to gender preference.Materials and methodsLists of dioecious plants used in Indian systems of medicine and folk medicine were compiled. Ethnobotanical data was collected on perceptions and awareness of dioecious plants, and preferences of use for specific genders of dioecious species using semi-structured interviews with folk healers in Tamil Nadu, India. In addition, twenty Ayurvedic doctors were interviewed to gain insight into the concept of plant gender in Ayurveda.ResultsIndian systems of medicine contain 5\xe2\x80\x937% dioecious species, and this estimate is congruent with the number of dioecious species in flowering plants in general. Informants recognized the phenomenon of dioecy in 31 out of 40 species, and reported gender preferences for 13 species with respect to uses as timber, food and medicine. Among informants different plant traits such as plant size, fruit size, and visibility of fruits determines the perception of a plant being a male or female. Ayurvedic classical literature provides no straightforward evidence on gender preferences in preparation of medicines or treatment of illness, however it contains details about reproductive morphology and sexual differentiation of plants.ConclusionsA knowledge gap exists in ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological literature on traditional knowledge of dioecious plants. From this explorative study it is evident that people have traditional knowledge on plant gender and preferential usages towards one gender. Based on this, we propose that researchers conducting ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological studies should consider documenting traditional knowledge on sexual systems of plants, and test the existence of gender specific usages in their conceptual framework and hypothesis testing. Incorporating such concepts could provide new dimensions of scientific knowledge with potential implications to conservation biology, chemical ecology, ethnoecology and drug discovery.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (250KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe fate of much of the world\xe2\x80\x99s terrestrial biodiversity is linked to the management of human-modified forest landscapes in the humid tropics. This Special Issue presents the first pan-tropical synthesis of research on the prospects for biodiversity in such systems, with eight individual regional summaries covering Mesoamerica, Amazonia, Atlantic forest of South America, West Africa, Madagascar, Western Ghats, Southeast Asia and Oceania. Two additional papers compare the state of conservation science in tropical forests with both temperate forests and savannah systems. This overview paper provides a comparative analysis of the threats and opportunities facing tropical forest biodiversity, thereby helping to identify the most pressing areas of future research and region-specific factors that contribute towards the effectiveness of individual conservation initiatives. While many of the threats facing tropical forest biodiversity are commonplace they vary markedly in their relative importance across different regions. There is a critical lack of comparable data to understand scale dependent processes, or the relative importance of varying geographic and historical contexts in determining present-day patterns. Conservation science has a key role to play in safeguarding the future of tropical forest biodiversity, but needs to become more effectively embedded in the context of real-world conservation challenges and opportunities. Significant progress can be achieved by improving the cost-effectiveness of research as well as the exchange of ideas and data amongst scientists working in different, often isolated parts of the world. We hope this special issue goes some way top achieving this exchange of knowledge.'

Abstract: 'AbstractYet there is considerable uncertainty over management effectiveness of many protected areas around the world. In this regard, long-term monitoring and management of disturbances in the protected areas need to be properly addressed and documented. The present study is aimed to analyze spatial extent, frequency and distribution of forest fires in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, Western Ghats, India over four decades (1973\xe2\x80\x932014). Multi-temporal Landsat and Indian Remote Sensing satellite data were used to quantify forest burnt area. The results showed that the spatial extent of burnt area greatly varied between 1318\xe2\x80\xafkm2 (in 1989) to 15.7\xe2\x80\xafkm2 (in 2013). The monitoring of fires during the recent decade (2005\xe2\x80\x932014) was observed to have a gradual decline over the reserve. High frequency of fires has been found in dry deciduous forest followed by moist deciduous forest, scrub, grassland and semi-evergreen forest. Among six protected areas, Bandipur National Park had represented more fire incidents followed by Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Nagarhole and Mukurthi National Parks. Grid analysis shows that 67% of the grids were affected by forest fires. Large burnt patches have steadily decreased in their size while the other patch classes showed a significant reduction in their size over the study period. This study had revealed the role of climate and accessibility in relation to fire occurrences. Based on historical burnt area mapping outputs, fire hotspots have been modeled to address fire risk zones. Indeed, the Mann-Kendall trend test has indicated that the overall trend of fire incidents have been declining and this indicates the management effectiveness in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve.'

Title: 'Aquatic hyphomycetes and litter decomposition in tropical \xe2\x80\x93 subtropical low order streams'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Species diversity is low across (sub)tropical streams.\xe2\x80\xa2Fungal activity in litter decomposition equals or is lower than in temperate zones.\xe2\x80\xa2Shredders occurrence and involvement in decomposition is generally low.\xe2\x80\xa2Fungal community composition is affected by the seasonal variation in rain fall.AbstractLeaf litter decomposition is an important ecosystem function carried out by a diverse array of consumers, including aquatic hyphomycetes. Aquatic hyphomycetes are found in streams worldwide, but their diversity and abundance varies across systems. In general, species diversity is lower across tropical and subtropical systems when compared with temperate biomes. The low diversity in tropical and subtropical areas may be related to: (a) lower seasonality; (b) our inability to detect fungi by traditional techniques; (c) low turbulence of rivers where many studies were carried out; (d) low nutrient content in many studied tropical systems; (e) leaves highly defended against consumers; and (f) competition from other decomposers. In terms of function, fungal biomass, sporulation rates and litter decomposition by aquatic hyphomycetes in the tropics was reported to be equivalent to or much lower than observed in temperate zones. The feeding ecology of shredder invertebrates is strongly related to the presence of microbial decomposers in the environment. The lack of shredders reported for some tropical rivers may be related to a low microbial biomass, well defended tropical leaves and frequent hydrological events which remove leaves before they can be used by shredders. Seasonal variations in rain fall in tropical and subtropical systems are likely to affect litter fall, the identity and quality of litter, the reproduction of aquatic hyphomycetes (due to turbulence effects) and therefore the community composition of aquatic hyphomycetes throughout the year. Future research on aquatic hyphomycetes and litter decomposition in the tropics and sub-tropics should address the diversity/identity gap, altitudinal gradient changes and the contribution of aquatic hyphomycetes to the trophic ecology of shredders.'

Title: 'Quantitative surveying of endogeic limbless vertebrates\xe2\x80\x94a case study of Gegeneophis ramaswamii (Amphibia: Gymnophiona: Caeciliidae) in southern India'
Author: 'G.J'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139302001750
Abstract: 'AbstractMany subterranean, limbless reptiles and amphibians are predators of invertebrate soil ecosystem engineers. The potential importance of these predators in soil ecology partly rests on whether they occur in high densities, but their abundance has rarely been measured, and there are no standard methods. The mostly tropical and fossorial caecilians (Amphibia: Gymnophiona) are often considered rare, but there are very few quantitative data, and some species, including Gegeneophis ramaswamii, have been reported as abundant in some situations. Using simple and repeatable survey methods with randomised 1\xc2\xa0m2 quadrats, surveys of G. ramaswamii were conducted at five localities in southern India. Densities of 0\xe2\x80\x931.87\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 per survey were measured, with means of 0.51 and 0.63\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 at the beginning and middle of monsoon, respectively. These densities were far greater than for sympatric caecilians (ichthyophiids; uraeotyphlids) and fossorial snakes (typhlopids; colubrids). While ecological data remain very scant, establishing quantitative methods to assess the abundance of endogeic limbless vertebrates is an important step toward greater understanding of subterranean predator\xe2\x80\x93prey relations, and of monitoring populations of these poorly known organisms.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis study provides an historical perspective on everyday experiences of weather and climate, through an analysis of the diaries of two colonial figures in Bombay, western India, in the 1820s: Mountstuart Elphinstone (the then Governor) and Lucretia West (the wife of the Chief Justice). The paper explores the ways in which climate impacted upon their daily routine and health, and discusses evidence for the influence of wider climatic narratives within their writings. Climate played a dominant and complex role within colonial discourse, providing both a barrier to colonisation, and a justification for European governance over populations that had become \xe2\x80\x98degenerate\xe2\x80\x99 through their exposure to tropical climates. Both of the diaries evidence this influence of climate within the colonists\xe2\x80\x99 daily lives, but demonstrate the differing responses to climate based on the two diarists\xe2\x80\x99 social positions. Mountstuart Elphinstone, in particular, had a strong sense of the impact of climate upon his health, in keeping with contemporary medical beliefs equating climate with physical wellbeing. The paper provides evidence of the evolution of acclimatisation discourse during the early nineteenth century, and suggests that European beliefs concerning tropical climates were changing simultaneously within both the medical establishment and the wider colonial community. The paper also explores the medical excursions that the diarists took to towns in the Western Ghats. It is apparent that their experiences of the climate in such towns were influenced by their prior expectations, a theme which resonates with discourses of climate in our own times.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba A study of acclimatisation discourse, within two diaries from colonial Bombay 1819\xe2\x80\x931828. \xe2\x96\xba Dominant role of weather in the lives of the colonists demonstrated. \xe2\x96\xba Evidence of shift in acclimatisation discourse during the early nineteenth century. \xe2\x96\xba Provides early evidence of colonial cultural attitudes towards Hill Stations. \xe2\x96\xba Universalities in experiences of climate are suggested.'

The ten extant Sri Lankan species belong to two distinct shell forms that are associated respectively with lowland and montane rainforest. We here present the first molecular phylogenetic analysis for Corilla. Our dataset includes nine nominal Sri Lankan species and is based on three mitochondrial genes (CO1, ND1 and 16S). Although the deeper nodes in the trees are not fully resolved, the results do suggest speciation in Corilla has involved repeated, ecologically-driven convergence in shell form. The mtDNA data agree with the current shell-based taxonomy for C. adamsi, C. beddomeae, C. carabinata, C. humberti and C. colletti, consistently supporting the first four as monophyletic, and supporting the last also as monophyletic in nearly all analyses. Corilla adamsi, C. beddomeae and C. colletti may each contain at least one additional, previously undescribed species. The relationship between northern and eastern C. odontophora couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be reliably resolved, but our results suggest that they are distinct species and that there is further species-level or intraspecific (geographical) differentiation within eastern C. odontophora. The current, morphologically-defined species limits of the three remaining nominal species, C. gudei, C. erronea and C. fryae, are inconsistent with the mtDNA sequence data. Northern and southern C. gudei appear to be distinct species: the sister taxon of southern C. gudei is C. humberti, and most analyses showed that the sister taxon of northern C. gudei is the lowland C. carabinata. Corilla erronea and C. fryae constitute a well supported clade in which both nominal species are paraphyletic. While most intra-clade CO1 p-distances are moderate to relatively large, the phylogenetic structuring within the clade does not seem to correspond to any obvious morphological, elevational or geographical patterns. These results are difficult to interpret, and further detailed study is needed before the taxonomic status of C. erronea and C. fryae can be resolved.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (170KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Contesting large-scale water supply projects at both ends of the pipe in Kathmandu and Melamchi Valleys, Nepal'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe residents of Kathmandu Valley in Nepal face increasing water shortages that worsen during the dry season. Against this situation, the Melamchi Water Supply megaproject, supported by several foreign investors, was launched in 2000 to quench Kathmanduties\xe2\x80\x99 thirst by bringing water from Melamchi River through a 26\xc2\xa0km-long tunnel. After more than 10\xc2\xa0years, progress has been very modest. Besides the political instability of the country, opposition from certain sectors of society in both the urban and rural settings has created continuous disruptions of the works. We draw on Urban Political Ecology and Environmental Justice frameworks to analyze two distinct, although interconnected, social struggles battling against the project. The first one, anchored in the urban sphere, took advantage of the entry of the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoists, and succeeded in bringing down Asian Development Bank\xe2\x80\x99s (ADB) lending condition of handing over the water supply management to a private sector operator. The second one concerns the ongoing struggle of the rural residents affected by the inter-basin transfer. Local people in the rural areas mainly advocated conservation of their source of livelihood and political recognition. In the last part, we discuss how the use of local water sources and community-based alternatives may emerge as an alternative to hegemonic models of nature\xe2\x80\x93society relations and contribute to overcome such conflicts and reduce negative impacts on the environment and social injustices.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba We trace the genesis of the contestation to the Melamchi Water Supply megaproject. \xe2\x96\xba We draw on Urban Political Ecology and Environmental Justice frameworks. \xe2\x96\xba Political recognition, social equality and prosperity are key demands. \xe2\x96\xba Decentralised local water management could be a way of overcoming such conflicts.'

Title: 'Ecology of Bambusa arudinacea (Retz.) Willd. growing in teak plantations of Kerala, India'
Author: 'U.M.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112796037991
Abstract: 'AbstractA study was undertaken to assess the contribution of bamboo to the vegetation structure, biomass productivity and nutrient cycling pattern in 15- and 20-year-old teak plantations in the Kariem-muriem Forest Range, Kerala, India. Based on the distribution pattern of bamboo colonised in these plantations, three types of site were recognised: site type A (bamboo-rich area), site type B (moderately bamboo-rich area) and site type C (bamboo-poor area). Density, basal area, number of culms per hectare, biomass, litter and net primary production of bamboo were greater in site type A than in site types B and C. While the soils of site types A and B were rich in potassium, those of site type C were rich in calcium. In addition to this, a negative correlation between above-ground biomass of bamboo and teak was recorded in site type A. In the case of teak, the rate of accumulation and the enrichment ratio of calcium were more than those of other elements. However, in bamboo, the enrichment ratio and accumulation rate of potassium were higher than in teak. The values for these parameters in bamboo were higher for potassium than for other elements. These results show that even from the nutrient conservation and cycling point of view, bamboo is a suitable species for site type A and teak is suitable for site types B and C. It is recommended that interplanting of bamboo in teak plantation, especially in areas like site types B and C, is not advisable. Instead, patch-planting may be more appropriate both to get better yield and to maintain ecosystem stability. It was also concluded that management of key elements of the ecosystem, such as potassium, is crucial for the stability of the ecosystem after disturbance or the conversion of natural forests into plantations.'

Title: 'Faunal mortality on roads due to religious tourism across time and space in protected areas: A case study from south India'
Author: 'K.S.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112711004567
Abstract: 'AbstractThe presence of roads in any landscape is known to negatively influence terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Many tourist destinations and religious enclaves in developing countries are inside protected areas (PA). They are well connected by roads and attract thousands of visitors. The effect of such large human congregations inside PA on biodiversity is not well understood. Here, we address the impacts of increased vehicular traffic due to religious tourism on local fauna inside the Kalakad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in south India. We sampled sections of surfaced roads for mortalities before and during an annual festival across three habitats in 2008 and 2009. Millipedes, anurans, insects and reptiles dominated the mortalities and mammals avoided the roads. A total of 1413 individuals belonging to 56 species were killed on roads. Nocturnal species constituted 50% of these mortalities and 64% of the species composition. There was a 299% increase in road mortalities and 648% increase in nocturnal species mortality during the festival compared to those before the festival. Mean mortalities varied across habitats and were highest in moist deciduous forests. Mortalities were influenced significantly by vehicular traffic rather than rainfall. Indications of a temporary local extinction were evident beyond certain threshold of vehicular movement. The number of vehicles plying on the roads was three times higher than the threshold level as determined in this study. The festival also had a spillover effect by causing increased mortalities on roads not connected to the temple. We discuss several strategies to minimize impacts due to large scale vehicular movement inside protected areas.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba A total of 1413 individuals belonging to 56 species were killed. \xe2\x96\xba There was a 299% increase in mortality and a 648% increase in nocturnal species mortality with increase in vehicles. \xe2\x96\xba Threshold for vehicular movement was determined as 0-50 vehicles/h for nocturnal and 0-150 vehicles/h for diurnal species. \xe2\x96\xba Possible temporary local extinction of nocturnal and invertebrate taxa with increased vehicular density is envisaged.'

Title: 'Ecological meaning and predictive ability of social status, vigour and competition indices in a tropical rain forest (India)'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe aim of this paper is to assess and compare the ecological meaning and predictive ability of several competition indices, which belong to several types \xe2\x80\x93 tree vigour indices, tree social status indices, local density indices and spatial competition indices \xe2\x80\x93 and come from different disciplines \xe2\x80\x93 ecology, silviculture, growth and yield modeling. We consider the case of an upper canopy and light-demanding dipterocarp species, Vateria indica L., which is frequent and endemic in the low to medium elevation moist evergreen forests of the Western Ghats in South India. Multivariate analyses showed that most indices are closely correlated with each other, as well as with tree size itself because they share common information on tree social status. Some indices bore additional information on local stand density that is independent from tree social status. The index that most accurately predicted diameter at breast height (dbh) increment is a modified version of the Dawkins code. This index can be assessed in the field without any complicated measurements but it requires preliminary training and regular cross-checking in order to ensure reproducibility across time and among observers. These results are consistent with those obtained on other light sensitive evergreen species in French Guiana. There is a need to generalize such studies to other species and forests and to better assess the meaning and predictive ability of competition indices in relation to the ecological behavior of the species.'

Title: 'Phenolics, fibre, alkaloids, saponins, and cyanogenic glycosides in a seasonal cloud forest in India'

Abstract: 'AbstractWe investigated secondary compounds in ephemeral and non-ephemeral parts of trees and lianas of a seasonal cloud forest in the Western Ghats of India. We measured astringency, phenolic content, condensed tannins, gallotannins, ellagitannins, and fibre, and also screened for alkaloids, saponins and cyanogenic glycosides in 271 plant parts across 33 tree and 10 liana species which constituted more than 90% of the tree and liana species of this species-poor forest. Cyanogenic glycosides occurred only in the young leaves of Bridelia retusa (Euphorbiaceae), i.e. in 2.3% of species examined. Alkaloids were absent from petioles, ripe fruit and mature seeds examined. Saponins were found in all types of plant parts. Condensed tannins occurred in almost all plant parts examined (93.6%), while hydrolysable tannins were less ubiquitous (gallotannins in 31.2% of samples, and ellagitannins in 18.9%). Astringency levels were significantly correlated with total phenolic, condensed tannin, and hydrolysable tannin contents. Condensed tannin and hydrolysable tannin contents were not related. Immature leaves, flowers, and petioles had high astringency while lower levels were found in fruit. Flowers and fruit had the lowest fibre levels. There was no relationship between relative dominance of a species in the forest and the fibre or phenolic contents of its mature leaves. In each plant part category, the frequency of species containing tannins together with alkaloids or saponins was significantly lower than the frequency of species containing tannins alone. There was, however, no segregation between alkaloids and saponins.'

Firstly, 33 seabed surface sediment samples from the northeastern Indian Ocean were selected for pollen analysis. Utilizing the 90\xc2\xb0E Indian Ridge as a dividing line, more Trilete spores (mainly Microlepia)and herbaceous pollen were present to the west or northwest of the line, possibly originating in Sri Lanka and India. More Polypodiaceae spores and tree pollen (Pinus excluded) were present to the east or southeast of the boundary, possibly originating in Sumatra Island. Based on the PCA analysis, the ocean current from the southeast to the northwest and the distance from land masses around the study area affect the percentage of pollen. Then, based on a fossil pollen analysis on the YDY05 core from the northeastern Indian Ocean, we determined that since 16\xe2\x80\xafka BP, the pollen terrestrial area might change from Sumatra Island to Sri Lanka Island and India, probably due to the climate and sea level change.'

Abstract: "AbstractThe hyporheic zones constitute a major site of storage of organic matter and energy flow in freshwater ecosystems. To complement the studies carried out in North America and Europe, we evaluated the sediment quality and occurrence of aquatic hyphomycetes in coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM; \xe2\x89\xa55\xc2\xa0mm) and fine particulate matter (FPM; \xe2\x89\xa41\xc2\xa0mm) in three locations of Kaiga stream and eight locations of Kadra dam of the River Kali in Western Ghats. The pH of sediments of stream and dam was acidic (5.8\xe2\x80\x936.6) and the average organic carbon of stream sediments was higher than dam sediments (8.6% vs. 3.9%). Among the eight minerals monitored, Fe was highest in all sediments and Ni was below detectable limit in four dam sediments. Spores of aquatic hyphomycetes were directly released from the CPOM fractions of sediments upon bubble chamber incubation, while the FPM fractions produced spores indirectly by colonization of sterile leaf baits followed by bubble chamber incubation. The species richness and diversity in CPOM was higher than FPM in stream as well as dam sediments. The Sorensen's similarity indices between the fungal flora of CPOM in stream (66.7\xe2\x80\x9381.8%) and dam (69.2\xe2\x80\x9388%) locations were generally higher than FPM. The spore output per mg CPOM was between 1215 (dam) and 3384 (stream). The species richness was negatively correlated with Cr (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01; r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x921.000) of stream sediments, while it was negatively correlated with organic carbon (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05; r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x920.740) and positively correlated with K (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05; r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.750) of dam sediments. Occurrence and survival of aquatic hyphomycetes in hyporheic habitats of freshwater bodies indicate the importance of such zones as reservoir of fungal inoculum necessary in fundamental functions such as organic matter processing and energy flow. The present study provides baseline data on the sediment quality and fungal composition of stream and dam locations of River Kali of Kaiga region, which will develop as center of industrial activities in future."

Abstract: 'AbstractThe geological history of the Indian subcontinent is marked by successive episodes of extensive isolation, which have provided ideal settings for the development of a unique floral and faunal diversity. By molecular phylogenetic analysis of a large set of ranid frog taxa from the Oriental realm, we show that four genera, now restricted to torrential habitats in the Western Ghats of India and the central highlands of Sri Lanka, represent remnants of ancient divergences. None of three other biodiversity hotspots in the Oriental mainland were found to harbour an equivalent level of long-term evolutionary history in this frog group. By unceasingly providing favourable humid conditions, the subcontinent\xe2\x80\x99s southern mountain ranges have served as refugia for old lineages, and hence constitute a unique reservoir of ancient ranid endemism.'

Title: 'Quantifying and mapping biodiversity and ecosystem services: Utility of a multi-season NDVI based Mahalanobis distance surrogate'
Author: 'Jagdish'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425708003696
Abstract: 'AbstractThere is an urgent need for techniques to rapidly and periodically measure biodiversity and ecosystem services over large landscapes. Conventional vegetation classification and mapping approaches are based on discrete arbitrary classes which do not capture gradual changes in forest type (and corresponding biodiversity and ecosystem services values) from site to site. We developed a simple multi-date NDVI based Mahalanobis distance measure (called eco-climatic distance) that quantifies forest type variability across a moisture gradient for complex tropical forested landscapes on a single ecologically interpretable, continuous scale. This Mahalanobis distance, unlike other distance measures takes into account the variability in the reference class and shared information amongst bands as it is based on the covariance matrix, and therefore is most useful to summarize ecological distance of a pixel to a reference class in multi-band remotely sensed space In this study we successfully apply this measure as a surrogate for tree biodiversity and ecosystem services at two nested scales for the Western Ghats Bio-diversity hotspot. Data from over 500 tree-plots and forest type maps was used to test the ability of this remotely sensed distance to be a surrogate for abundance based tree-species compositional turn-over and as a continuous measure of forest type and ecosystem services. Our results suggest a strong but scale dependant relationship between the remotely-sensed distance measure and floristic distance between plots. The multi-date NDVI distance measure emerges as very good quantitative surrogate for forest type and is a useful complement to existing forest classification systems. This surrogate quantifies forest type variability on a single, continuous quantitative scale and has important applications in conservation planning and mapping and monitoring of hydrologic and carbon storage and sequestration services.'

Abstract: 'AbstractGenus Nemacheilus, Nemachilichthys and Schistura belong to the family Nemacheilidae of the order Cypriniformes. The present investigation was undertaken to observe genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationship and to develop a molecular-based tool for taxonomic identification. For this purpose, four different types of molecular markers were utilized in which 29 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), 25 inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers, and 10 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker sets were screened and mitochondrial COI gene was sequenced. This study added COI barcodes for the identification of Nemacheilus anguilla, Nemachilichthys rueppelli and Schistura denisoni. RAPD showed higher polymorphism (100%) than the ISSR (93.75\xe2\x80\x93100%) and AFLP (93.86\xe2\x80\x9398.96%). The polymorphic information content (PIC), heterozygosity, multiplex ratio, and gene diversity was observed highest for AFLP primers, whereas the major allele frequency was observed higher for RAPD (0.5556) and lowest for AFLP (0.1667). The COI region of all individuals was successfully amplified and sequenced, which gave a 100% species resolution.'

Author: 'Mark S.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2A review of experimental and observational studies on native tree species beneath pine.\xe2\x80\xa2Pine plantations serve as successional surrogates for native species recruitment and growth.\xe2\x80\xa2Dipterocarp tree species demonstrate high survival and growth beneath pine.\xe2\x80\xa2Forest restoration is a viable economic strategy compared to tea cultivation.AbstractIn the wet forest regions of southwest Sri Lanka and the Western Ghats, India, Pinus caribaea was a common tree species for reforestation on public lands that were originally cleared of native forest for agriculture but subsequently succeeded to fire tolerant grasses and ferns. Much of this reforestation occurred during the 1970s and 1980s. The ecological literature suggests that in many temperate broadleaf forest regions pine is an important component of early succession on old fields, beneath which second growth hardwood can establish and eventually dominate. More recent studies have demonstrated the establishment of native rain forest regeneration beneath a variety of exotic tree plantations. We review nearly twenty-five years of research on this topic for South Asia through a series of studies done in southwest Sri Lanka. Results demonstrate that native species recruitment of both pioneers and site generalist late-successional trees grow well beneath exotic pine plantations. Diversity and density increase from plantation interior to edge. Protection from groundstory fire is the single most important component of promoting regeneration recruitment beneath pine. Establishing late-successional site and dispersal restricted species requires planting beneath pine rather than reliance on natural establishment. Best establishment and growth occur in openings where rows of canopy pine have been removed. Species considered for planting comprise the major late-successional canopy tree species of the forest in the genera Dipterocarpus, Shorea (Dipterocarpaceae) and Mesua (Clusiaceae). Native species that produce non-timber forest products (NTFP) need to be planted with best results in canopy openings. The most valuable NTFP\xe2\x80\x99s comprise a sugar palm (Caryota urens), rattan (Calamus spp.) and a medicinal liana (Coscinium fenestratum). Financial analyses reveal that pine plantations that are enrichment planted and cultivated with rain forest timber and non-timber species can provide superior economic benefits as compared to land cultivated singly for tea.'

It is a very important and challenging task for the advanced forecasting of such EREs on seasonal time scales which will provide enough lead time for the disaster management, smart agricultural practice and pro-active health care for example. Researchers around the world are looking at ways to improve the skill and reliability of forecasts of EREs on a range of time scales from daily to seasonal and General Circulation Models (GCMs) are now widely used to forecast EREs on a seasonal time scale. In the present study, a variable resolution general circulation model (VRGCM) is being configured and evaluated for the seasonal prediction of the number of EREs in three different categories depending upon the threshold of daily rainfall over the continental India during the monsoon (JJA) season for 16 years (i.e. 1998\xe2\x80\x932013). The skill of model prediction is evaluated by validating the simulated ERE counts with the high resolution gridded rainfall data available from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The spatio-temporal analysis, seasonal cycle and the Interannual variability of the of EREs over continental India using GCM simulation and IMD observations shows good agreement and the model configuration has potential skill for the simulation of EREs in seasonal prediction mode and the present results provide the application of VRGCM for seamless prediction of EREs over India.'

Abstract: 'AbstractUrban planning is a tool, which enables in managing changes within a spatial approach. It helps in conducting planning activities where the economic, environmental, and social goals are taken care of holistically. Planning process involves studying past trends, learning from past and present, and then preparing a proposal for future. This process mostly assesses the trend of growth and plans for development. A trend follows change in a defined rate. An indefinite or unexpected change spoils the planning process, by breaking the trend of growth. City is known for its resources, geography, population, social-culture structure, economy etc. Whenever there is an unexpected change in any of these parameters, the city undergoes remarkable changes. Disaster also brings hasty changes in all these, which is indeed a challenge to urban planning and design. The fast modernization and adoption of western culture leads to significant changes in socio-cultural and economic spheres. City also changes, when rapid movement of people and resources occur. Tourism industry in this decade brought many changes is Indian cities. It diversifies social and cultural identity of the city and generates tremendous opportunity for economic development. Therefore cities having tourism potential are facing urban planning problems. Exploring these issues and reasons behind it will be helpful to minimize its impact. Tourism cities have tremendous potential of research in this direction. The need of the decade for urban planners and designers is to be prepared for the changes in a tourist city.'

Title: 'A review of modeling approaches for ecosystem services assessment in the Asian region'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We reviewed 31 ecosystem services assessments and 290 peer-reviewed studies throughout Asia.\xe2\x80\xa278 peer-reviewed studies using modeling approach were identified.\xe2\x80\xa2The modeling studies were classified based on processes evaluated by the models.\xe2\x80\xa2A bias in the geographic distribution was identified in the peer-reviewed studies.\xe2\x80\xa2Gaps exist in the approaches applied in the assessment cases and peer-reviewed studies.AbstractThe use of various modeling approaches is critical in the assessment of ecosystem services. Although numerous assessments have been conducted as scholarly studies to quantify, map, and value ecosystem services, a well-structured platform is necessary to ensure consistency of the assessment approaches with regard to theories and practices. To identify gaps between practical ecosystem services assessments and scholarly studies in the Asian region, we reviewed assessment cases in the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) catalogue and peer-reviewed literature using Web platforms. We identified 31 assessment cases and 290 such peer-reviewed studies conducted throughout Asia. Our review of recent peer-reviewed studies revealed a bias in the geographic distribution, with numerous Chinese studies and few studies in West Asia. Our comparison of the approaches applied in the assessment cases with those in the peer-reviewed studies revealed that little information on the models was reported in the assessment cases, whereas the approaches used in the peer-reviewed studies were mostly modeling and biophysical indicators. Although the modeling and scenario approaches used in the actual assessments require further clarification in the IPBES catalogue, many scientific modeling studies have been conducted throughout Asia. These scientific data, however, are not easily accessible to those outside of academic communities. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a new catalogue to guide all the stakeholders involved in ecosystem services assessment at multiple scales.'

Abstract: 'AbstractPlant growth promoting effects of two Pseudomonas fluorescens strains, CHA0 and Pf1 were tested alone or in combinations with chitin on banana cv.Virupakshi (Musa spp. AAB) in terms of growth, yield, leaf nutrient contents and physiology in lower Pulney hills, Western Ghats, India under rainfed field conditions. The P. fluorescens strains, CHA0 and Pf1 were tested for their efficiency to produce chitinases in the presence of chitin molecules. Bio-formulations containing PGPR strains and chitin molecules were further developed to improve the chitinolytic activity of the rhizobacteria. The bio-formulations amended with chitin, viz., CHA0\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0chitin significantly increased the height and girth of pseudostem, bunch yield, number of hands per bunch, fingers per hand and quality attributes compared to other treatments both in plant as well as ratoon crops. Further, the application of CHA0\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0chitin significantly improved the N, P and K contents of banana leaves when compared to untreated control. These results revealed that P. fluorescens strain, CHA0 in combination with chitin has the potential to increase growth, leaf nutrient contents and yield of banana plants under perennial cropping systems. In view of environmental pollution, due to excessive use and high production costs of fertilizers, PGPR strains tested in our study have a potential to be used for sustainable and environmentally friendly horticultural production.'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The emergence period of L. lepidophora adults was between June and October during 2013 and 2014.\xe2\x80\xa2Emergence time was restricted to 1800\xe2\x80\x932100\xc2\xa0h.\xe2\x80\xa2The overall sex ratio of L. lepidophora was female biased with males emerging first in the season.\xe2\x80\xa2Female-baited traps successfully attracted male beetles of L. lepidophora.\xe2\x80\xa2Female beetles were successfully utilized for attraction of males which could be incorporated for IPM.AbstractWhite grub, Leucopholis lepidophora Blanchard (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Melolonthinae), is a major insect pest infesting areca nut in India. Larvae feed on roots (hence also called root grubs), causing reduced number of roots, loss of anchorage, stem tapering, reduced number of fronds, yellowing of leaves, yield reduction and death of the plants. The biology and ecology aspect of this scarabaeid are scanty. Hence, the aim of this study was to understand the ecological and behavioral aspects to develop IPM program. The adult emergence pattern of L. lepidophora was observed daily during the rainy season. The emergence period was defined between June and October during 2013 and 2014. Peak emergence of adult beetles occurred between 1900 and 2000\xc2\xa0h. When raining occurred between 1800 and 2100\xc2\xa0h, no emergence of adult beetles was observed. The sex ratio of L. lepidophora varied over time, but the overall sex ratio was female biased in both the study years (female:male; 1:1.18 and 1:1.46 in 2013 and 2014, respectively). Males were found to emerge first in the season resulting in protandry. Innovative idea emerged during our field experiments in 2013\xe2\x80\x932014 was the use of female beetles for attracting male beetles. Female adults were collected and placed individually in traps made of small pouches of nylon net and were tied to the areca palm at a height of 5\xc2\xa0ft. Trap containing a female beetle attracted male individuals for about 8\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0days. The same technique was employed for the large-scale collection of beetles during 2014. A total of 1843 males were collected in an areca grower's field using female-baited traps during 2014. Male baited traps did not attract female beetles, indicating existence of only female produced semiochemical that attracts males. Our findings provide new insights for incorporating adult collection using female-baited traps in IPM against areca nut white grubs.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image"

Title: 'Relationship between annual rainfall and tree mortality in a tropical dry forest: Results of a 19-year study at Mudumalai, southern India'
Author: 'H.S.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112709006628
Abstract: 'AbstractVariability in rainfall is known to be a major influence on the dynamics of tropical forests, especially rates and patterns of tree mortality. In tropical dry forests a number of contributing factors to tree mortality, including dry season fire and herbivory by large herbivorous mammals, could be related to rainfall patterns, while loss of water potential in trees during the dry season or a wet season drought could also result in enhanced rates of death. While tree mortality as influenced by severe drought has been examined in tropical wet forests there is insufficient understanding of this process in tropical dry forests. We examined these causal factors in relation to inter-annual differences in rainfall in causing tree mortality within a 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot located in the tropical dry deciduous forests of Mudumalai, southern India, that has been monitored annually since 1988. Over a 19-year period (1988\xe2\x80\x932007) mean annual mortality rate of all stems >1\xc2\xa0cm dbh was 6.9\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa04.6% (range\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01.5\xe2\x80\x9317.5%); mortality rates broadly declined from the smaller to the larger size classes with the rates in stems >30\xc2\xa0cm dbh being among the lowest recorded in tropical forest globally. Fire was the main agent of mortality in stems 1\xe2\x80\x935\xc2\xa0cm dbh, elephant-herbivory in stems 5\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0cm dbh, and other natural causes in stems >10\xc2\xa0cm dbh. Elephant-related mortality did not show any relationship to rainfall. On the other hand, fire-related mortality was significantly negatively correlated to quantity of rainfall during the preceding year. Mortality due to other causes in the larger stem sizes was significantly negatively correlated to rainfall with a 2\xe2\x80\x933-year lag, suggesting that water deficit from mild or prolonged drought enhanced the risk of death but only with a time lag that was greater than similar lags in tree mortality observed in other forest types. In this respect, tropical dry forests growing in regions of high rainfall variability may have evolved greater resistance to rainfall deficit as compared to tropical moist or temperate forests but are still vulnerable to drought-related mortality.'

A reliable map of Asian elephant distribution and measures of spatial variation in their abundance, both vital needs for conservation and management action, are unavailable not only in Karnataka, but across its global range. Here, we use various data gathered between 2000 and 2015 to map the distribution of elephants in Karnataka at the scale of the smallest forest management unit, the \xe2\x80\x98beat\xe2\x80\x99, while also presenting data on elephant dung density for a subset of \xe2\x80\x98elephant beats.\xe2\x80\x99 Elephants occurred in 972 out of 2855 forest beats of Karnataka. Sixty percent of these 972 beats\xe2\x80\x94and 55% of the forest habitat\xe2\x80\x94lay outside notified protected areas (PAs), and included lands designated for agricultural production and human dwelling. While median elephant dung density inside protected areas was nearly thrice as much as outside, elephants routinely occurred in or used habitats outside PAs where human density, land fraction under cultivation, and the interface between human-dominated areas and forests were greater. Based on our data, it is clear that India\xe2\x80\x99s framework for elephant conservation\xe2\x80\x94which legally protects the species wherever it occurs, but protects only some of its habitats\xe2\x80\x94while being appropriate in furthering their conservation within PAs, seriously falters in situations where elephants reside in and/or seasonally use areas outside PAs. Attempts to further elephant conservation in production and dwelling areas have extracted high costs in human, elephant, material and monetary terms in Karnataka. In such settings, conservation planning exercises are necessary to determine where the needs of elephants\xe2\x80\x94or humans\xe2\x80\x94must take priority over the other, and to achieve that in a manner that is based not only on reliable scientific data but also on a process of public reasoning.'

Abstract: 'In searching for different patterns of practice, lifestyle, and environment supportive of optimal health, we look to our elders around the world, who in the wisdom that has sustained them, we learn from with careful attention. Thirty-seven elders who live by their traditions participated in the present study. They assisted in the refinement of the methodology and collections and preparation of these data. These participants are well-respected, representative elders and traditional healers of their regions. These data, from study sites of the Eastern Afromontane and Albertine Rift region of Ethiopia, Africa; the Maya Mountains region of Belize, Central America; the Western Ghats region of India; and the Appalachian Mountains region of the United States, were grouped into three major categories: (1) philosophy, attitudes, and outlook, (2) lifestyle practices, and (3) dietary and nutritional practices. These elders demonstrate a relatively comprehensive but simple set of practices that can enhance our vitality and promote longevity sustainably. In essence, these practices, or practice wisdom, of our longest living elders, promote propagation of healthful lifestyles by following traditional ways and taking care of body, mind, spirit and our environment. Further field research among a larger cohort is required to fully generalize the findings of this study, but much of it is consistent with what we already know should be done. These data begin illustration of practice wisdom for implementation and serve to engage our universities, our hospitals, our industries, and our students, who we must position toward social change.'

Abstract: 'AbstractKochi is a rapidly growing commercial, industrial and trading centre of Kerala. Due to the tremendous growth and urbanization, the density of population in city is increasing every year. These factors have resulted in land use stresses, reducing open areas especially wetlands [1] in Kochi city for the past decades through land reclamation and encroachments. Again, anthropogenic activities like industrialisation, improper management of sewage and other solid waste lead to degradation of these ecosystems. This study discusses about the unique status of wetlands of Kadamakudypanchayat of Kochi with its Pokkali fields [2], fish farms. It also tries to propose guidelines, strategies and action plan at site specific level for development, conserving its wetlands along with its wise use in an ecological perspective keeping in mind the rapid urbanisation.'

Hence, there is an urgent need for rapid assessment and monitoring of biodiversity on priority using state-of-art tools and technologies. The main purpose of this research article is to develop and implement a new methodological approach to characterize biological diversity using spatial model developed during the study viz. Spatial Biodiversity Model (SBM). The developed model is scale, resolution and location independent solution for spatial biodiversity richness modelling. The platform-independent computation model is based on parallel computation. The biodiversity model based on open-source software has been implemented on R statistical computing platform. It provides information on high disturbance and high biological richness areas through different landscape indices and site specific information (e.g. forest fragmentation (FR), disturbance index (DI) etc.). The model has been developed based on the case study of Indian landscape; however it can be implemented in any part of the world. As a case study, SBM has been tested for Uttarakhand state in India. Inputs for landscape ecology are derived through multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques in an interactive command line environment. MCDM with sensitivity analysis in spatial domain has been carried out to illustrate the model stability and robustness. Furthermore, spatial regression analysis has been made for the validation of the output.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (416KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: "AbstractApplication of remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) as a tool has assumed an immense significance in habitat suitability modelling for various wildlife species and now a days these are widely used in conservation biology and wildlife management.This paper evaluates habitat suitability for tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) in Chandoli National Park, India. This research provides information about potential areas that can be declared as Tiger Reserve, a federal designation of protection. Habitat evaluation was completed in the Chandoli National Park (17\xc2\xb0 04\xe2\x80\xb2 00\xe2\x80\xb3 N to 17\xc2\xb0 19\xe2\x80\xb2 54\xe2\x80\xb3 N and 73\xc2\xb0 40\xe2\x80\xb2 43\xe2\x80\xb3 E to 73\xc2\xb0 53\xe2\x80\xb2 09\xe2\x80\xb3 E) using habitat suitability index (HSI). Remotely sensed data of satellite IRS-P6, LISS-III of 25th February 2005 was procured from National Remote Sensing Agency, India. The satellite imagery data was digitally processed and collateral data were generated from topographic maps in a GIS framework. Various layers of different variables such as landuse land cover, forest density, measures of proximity to disturbances and water resources and a digital terrain model were created based on ground truthing. These layers, GPS location of animal's presence and \xe2\x80\x9cbinomial multiple logistic regression (BMLR)\xe2\x80\x9d techniques were integrated in a GIS environment for the HSI modelling.Results indicate that approximately 160.48\xc2\xa0km2 (55%) of the forest of Chandoli National Park is highly suitable for herbivores population, and 176.52\xc2\xa0km2 (50%) of the Park is suitable for tigers. Therefore, this study concludes that forest areas within the Chandoli National Park are appropriate for consideration as Tiger Reserve.Furthermore, the identification and mapping of wildlife corridors and other forest patches lying in between neighboring protected area like Koyana sanctuary, suggests that these region of Sahyadri range of Western Ghats should be included into the proposed Tiger Reserve. This will be a benefit for tigers, as tigers require larger and least disturbed forest habitats for establishing and maintaining their high-density population. Fortunately, in May 2008 the Government of India declared Chandoli NP as tiger reserve. Thus declaration of Chandoli National Park as a Tiger Reserve reflects that the habitat suitability model developed by us for tiger was not only statistically sound but also has potential to be considered while taking any decision regarding wildlife habitat management."

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Conditions of microsite reached by seeds determine persistence in Cassia roxburghii.\xe2\x80\xa2Temperature varies between micro-sites, affecting dormancy break ability.\xe2\x80\xa2Seeds with physical dormancy have adapted mechanisms to survive in tropical ecosystems.AbstractSeeds with an impermeable coat, i.e. physical dormancy (PY) persist in the soil for a long-time until suitable environmental cues break dormancy and germination is synchronized with the growing season. However, the dormancy loss of seeds at different microsites has not been well characterized. In this study, the effect of microsite affecting dormancy loss in Cassia roxburghii was studied by artificially burying the seeds in an open site and under canopy and exhuming the seeds at 6 month intervals for two years. The soil temperatures of the two microsites at seed vicinity were determined using a data-logger. The results showed that fresh intact seeds did not absorb water, but mechanically scarifying the seeds resulted in water absorption and germination at a wide range of temperatures both in light and darkness. Thus, the seeds of C. roxburghii have PY. Throughout the study period, impermeable seeds buried in the open site broke dormancy in significantly higher number compared with seeds buried under canopy cover (P < 0.05), presumably due to the temperature variation between microsites. Open sites recorded temperatures above 60\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb0C during summer with diurnal temperature fluctuations close to 20\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb0C, whereas under canopy cover temperature remained close to 40\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb0C during summer and much lower during other seasons. These results suggest that the ability of C. roxburghii seeds to break dormancy and establish soil seed banks is affected by the microsite variation.'

Abstract: 'AbstractFrom the ancient time, the Northeast part of India is rich in biodiversity because of its diverse topographic, climatic features. Different varieties of mammalian, avian, and herpetofauna are endemic to this region. Unfortunately, life of this diverse flora and fauna is in jeopardy due to serious anthropogenic pressure. Once a large number of globally important species sustained in the Barak Valley. However, with the increasing population and subsequent demand on natural resources and developing activities, many of the species are no more found in the valley. If the conservation action is not initiated, the remaining species will also vanish with time. This article highlights the distribution and conservation problems of four endangered species in the Barak Valley of Assam, India and recommended conservation tactics.'

Title: 'Precipitation signal in pollen rain from tropical forests, South India'
Author: 'D'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034666701000574
Abstract: 'AbstractWe have analyzed the pollen content of 51 surface soil samples collected in tropical evergreen and deciduous forests from the Western Ghats of South India sampled along a west to east gradient of decreasing rainfall (between 11\xc2\xb030\xe2\x80\x9313\xc2\xb020\xe2\x80\xb2N and 75\xc2\xb030\xe2\x80\x9376\xc2\xb030\xe2\x80\xb2E). Values of mean annual precipitation (Pann, mm/yr) have been calculated at each of the 51 sampling sites from a great number of meteorological stations in South India, using a method of data interpolation based on artificial neural network. Interpolated values at the pollen sites of Pann range from 1200 to 5555\xc2\xa0mm/yr, while mean temperature of the coldest month (MTCO) remains >15\xc2\xb0C and humidity factor (AET/PET, the actual evapotranspiration to potential evapotranspiration ratio) remains also included between 65 and 72%.Results are presented in the form of percentage pollen diagrams where samples are arranged according to increasing values of annual precipitation. They indicate that the climatic signal of rainfall is clearly evidenced by distinct pollen associations. Numerical analyses show that annual precipitation is an important parameter explaining the modern distribution of pollen taxa in this region. Pollen taxa markers of high rainfall (Pann >2500\xc2\xa0mm/yr) are Mallotus type, Elaeocarpus, Syzygium type, Oleadioica, Gnetumula, and Hopea type, associated with Ixora type and Caryota. Pollen taxa markers of low rainfall (Pann <2500\xc2\xa0mm/yr) are Melastomataceae/Combretaceae, Maytenus type, Lagerstroemia and Grewia. The proportions of evergreen taxa and of arboreal taxa vary according to rainfall values. Indeed, when rainfall is <2500\xc2\xa0mm/yr, percentage of arboreal pollen (AP) is <50% and proportion of evergreen taxa is <20%. When rainfall exceeds 2500\xc2\xa0mm/yr, AP values average 70%, and proportion of evergreen taxa increases from 60 to 90%. Moreover, a good correlation between precipitation and proportion of evergreen taxa (0.85) presumes that precipitation can be estimated from pollen data.'

Abstract: 'AbstractInvasion of native communities by exotic species has been among the most perverse ecological problems in recent years. In the present study, we predicted the probable distribution of two invasive plant species Mimosa diplotricha Sauvalle and Mikania micrantha Kunth in a protected tropical grassland of Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park, Assam, Northeast India using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) distribution modelling algorithm. We found that about 30\xe2\x80\x9340% (25\xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xa0km2) area of the protected area (78.8\xc2\xa0km2) have high chances of being invaded by both the invasive plants that are prime habitat to the greater one horned Rhinoceros and other important grassland dwellers. Both the models have an accuracy of AUC\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.99. Precipitation in warmest quarters played a major role among the environmental variables in spread of both the invasive plants. The findings of the present study will help the management authority to take the necessary steps in the identified area to chalk out a comprehensive strategy for control of the invasive plant species. The probable areas most likely to be invaded by the invasive plant species have to be monitored regularly, and intervention like manual uprooting needs to be scheduled during the early stage of its life cycle and before flowering. The frontline staffs of the national park need to be apprised about the ecology and impact of invasive plants for better monitoring and eradication of these detrimental plants.'

Title: 'Soil Water Retention Curve from Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity for Sandy Loam and Loamy Sand Textured Soils\xe2\x98\x86'

Abstract: 'AbstractKnowledge of the soil hydraulic properties is indispensable to solve many soil and water management problems related to agriculture, ecology, and environmental issues. Soil hydraulic properties are key factors that regulate the movement of groundwater and transport of solutes. The most important hydraulic properties of soils are the soil water retention curve (SWRC) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (ks). Determination of these hydraulic properties is needed for many studies and applications related to irrigation, drainage, water movement and solute transport in the soil. Although many advances are made for direct measurements of SWRC and ks, they are usually time consuming and costly. Some attempts have been made to indirectly predict these hydraulic properties. The objective of this study was to derive an empirical relationship to estimate soil water retention curve from saturated hydraulic conductivity. One hundred and one soil samples were collected from agricultural and forest sites at different depths, at different locations in the Pavanje river basin that lies in the southern coastal region of Karnataka, India. The saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured in the laboratory by variable falling head method using Permeameter and soil water retention curve data was obtained through pressure plate apparatus for all the agricultural and forest soils. Prediction accuracies were evaluated using coefficient of determination, root mean square error, mean error, Akaike Information Criteria, between measured and predicted values. The results obtained from the prediction of soil moisture retention curve from saturated hydraulic conductivity, shows that the developed relationship are reasonably useful to get the soil moisture retention curve for the soils of agricultural and forested hillslopes of the region under consideration.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe Dipterocarpaceae, a well known and economically important family of trees of the tropical rain forests of Asia, comprise over 470 species. These angiosperm trees contribute to 30% of the total area in typical lowland evergreen forests in Southeast Asia. Despite their remarkable diversity and regional ecological dominance, the origins and phytogeographical evolution of the family are poorly understood. The earliest dipterocarp fossils recorded in SE Asia come from Oligocene (34\xe2\x80\x9323\xc2\xa0Ma) sediments of Borneo. Here, we report an occurrence of Asian dipterocarps from approximately 53\xc2\xa0Ma old sediments from western India based on fossil resin chemistry and palynological data. An important implication of our finding is that Asian dipterocarps must have originated in Gondwana and dispersed from India into Asia once the land connection between the Indian and Asian plate was well established during the middle Eocene (49\xe2\x80\x9341\xc2\xa0Ma). Moreover, the present study supports the hypothesis which suggests that many angiosperms did not originate in the SE Asian region, but dispersed into the area from western Gondwanaland.Research highlights\xe2\x96\xba Dipterocarpaceae contribute to 30% of the total area in lowland evergreen forests in Southeast Asia. \xe2\x96\xba The earliest dipterocarp fossils recorded in SE Asia come from Oligocene. \xe2\x96\xba We report an occurrence of dipterocarps from 53 Ma sediments of western India based on resin chemistry and pollen data. \xe2\x96\xba Asian dipterocarps were originated in Gondwana and dispersed out-of-India into Asia during the middle Eocene.'

Title: 'Formation of tri-lobed stem and development of successive cambia in the stems of Argyreia hookeri C. B. Clarke (Convolvulaceae)'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Development of successive cambia on 3 sides results tri-lobbed stem in A. hookeri.\xe2\x80\xa2A unique pattern of vessel restriction is reported in genus Argyreia.\xe2\x80\xa2Occurrence of tyloses in fibres is reported for the first time in literature.\xe2\x80\xa2Intraxylary sieve elements are of two different diameters.AbstractStructural transformation of the xylem is a fundamental feature for the successful adaptation of climbing habit in plants. Therefore, their stems at juvenile stage are inflexible before they start climbing but their pattern of secondary growth and type of xylem cell production typically changes as they start climbing. Consequently, stem become flexible and most often show development of successive cambia in many species. In several climbers, successive cambia show unequal cambial activity and deposition of secondary xylem. Subsequently, stems with different shapes can be observed in trans-sections. In the present study light microscopic analysis revealed that stems of Argyreia hookeri C. B. Clarke (Convolvulaceae) increased in thickness by forming crescent-shaped successive segments of cambia at three sides of the stem. Development of such cambia resulted in tri-lobed (\xe2\x80\x9cY\xe2\x80\x9d shaped) outline of the stem in transverse view. Initially the stem was circular in outline but with the advancement of secondary growth, alternate segments of cambium become functionally slow on three alternate places while rest of the alternate segments showed normal activity, thus the stem become triangular. After a short period of secondary growth, new sectors of crescent-shaped cambia originated from the pericyclic parenchyma opposite to functional segments. In contrast, alternate segment (functionally slow) of the first cambium did not form the cambium on its outside. Development of subsequent crescent-shaped cambia consequently forms tri-lobed stems. Development of successive cambia on three sides of A. hookeri stems appear to be associated with the decrease in flexural rigidity and tri-lobed outline of stem may be helpful to limit physical disruption of vascular tissues during twisting/hanging/bending, and slipping or falling from supporting host. Structure and development of secondary xylem is described in detail and correlated with the climbing habit.'

Title: 'The social connectivity of urban rivers'
Author: 'G. Mathias'

Abstract: "AbstractBy social connectivity we refer to the communication and movement of people, goods, ideas, and culture along and across rivers, recognizing longitudinal, lateral, and vertical connectivity, much as has been described for other rivers for hydrology and ecology. We focus on rivers as they pass through cities, and the relationships between these rivers and city dwellers. Historically, the most important longitudinal connectivity function of rivers was their role as major transport routes and the simplification of formerly complex, irregular banks and beds, into straight, uniform shipping channels has resulted in a loss of lateral and vertical connectivity, notably the quotidian uses such as fishing, washing clothes, water supply, swimming and other recreation.The scale of the river itself, and its scale in comparison to the scale of the city, largely determine the river's social function and the degree to which it influences city form. River width affects the perception of \xe2\x80\x98closeness\xe2\x80\x99 of the other bank, ease of bridging the river, influence of the river on the city's street pattern, and type of waterfront uses that occur. Up to 15\xc2\xa0m wide, people can converse, whereas across rivers ~\xc2\xa050 to ~\xc2\xa0200\xc2\xa0m wide, people are not recognizable but still clearly visible, instilling the banks with a \xe2\x80\x98lively\xe2\x80\x99 atmosphere. At widths over ~\xc2\xa0200\xc2\xa0m, people blur, yet moving vehicles and trees branches shaking in wind may still provide some dynamic elements to an otherwise static landscape composed of building facades. In exceptionally wide rivers, the city on the opposite bank is little more than a skyline, which often becomes a signature and symbol of regional identity.In contemplating how people use rivers, we can define a range of human activities in relation to height above the water (i.e., instream to banktop), a vertical dimension of human connectivity with rivers. Many uses occur on the top of the bank, such as quiet contemplation, walking, or cycling along a riverside trail, while others depend on contact with the water itself, such as wading, diving, and canoeing (which presupposes adequate water quality). Many of these relationships are illustrated by the challenge of reconnecting Cairo with the Nile."

Abstract: "AbstractThis report provides information regarding the distribution range, population status, and threats of the nationally threatened Cantor's leaf-nosed bat from Odisha, eastern India. The study revealed six new roosting sites of the species with an estimated total population of 97 individuals. Roosting sites were mostly recorded within moist deciduous habitats, located in caves, old temples, and buildings. In most of the sites, bats are threatened from roost site disturbance and hunted for ethnozoological uses. We recommend long-term monitoring on population trends in relation to human activities. The information generated from the study will aid in reassessing the conservation status of the species in future."

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Calling males of N. humayuni had higher urinary testosterone metabolite levels.\xe2\x80\xa2Urinary corticosterone metabolites were comparable in calling & non-calling males.\xe2\x80\xa2Urinary corticosterone and testosterone metabolites were positively correlated.\xe2\x80\xa2Calling males had higher energy reserves than the non-calling males.\xe2\x80\xa2Vocal effort was not associated with testosterone, corticosterone or body condition.AbstractIn vertebrates, the increase in plasma androgens and corticosteroids is essential for the expression of reproductive behaviour. In male anurans, the interaction between hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal and hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axes plays a pivotal role in calling behaviour and energy mobilisation through the secretion of testosterone and corticosterone respectively. To explain the association among body condition, testosterone, corticosterone and calling behaviour the energetic-hormone-vocalisation (EHV) model has been proposed. The model predicts that with continued participation in chorus activity within and across nights, levels of circulating androgens, corticosterone and vocal effort tend to increase and should be positively correlated in calling males. Consequently, decreasing energy reserves should be inversely correlated with corticosterone level in calling males. Depleted energy reserves lead to the peaking of circulating corticosterone, which suppresses androgen production and calling behaviour. In the present study, we used Nyctibatrachus humayuni with unique reproductive behaviour to test the model by quantifying calling behaviour and urinary metabolites of testosterone and corticosterone. We also computed the body condition index (BCI) to assess the association among energetics, levels of testosterone, corticosterone and calling behaviour. The results show that calling males had higher levels of urinary testosterone metabolites (UTM) than non-calling males indicating the importance of testosterone in controlling the calling behaviour. Surprisingly, urinary corticosterone metabolite (UCM) levels were comparable between calling and non-calling males. Further, calling males had higher body condition estimates than non-calling males. The vocal effort was neither associated with UTM, UCM nor BCI. However, a positive association was observed between UTM and UCM levels in calling males indicating the requirement of higher energy for advertisement. Analysis of UTM and UCM levels throughout the breeding season revealed that breeding basal of UTM was significantly higher than that of UCM. Interestingly, UCM levels were maintained at a lower threshold during the breeding season. These observations are in line with some of the predictions of EHV model.'

Abstract: 'AbstractCane is one of the important forest products after timber, form an integral part of a rural and tribal population of many of the tropical countries of South East Asia, Africa and America. Calamus nambariensis Becc. has been recognized as endemic and threatened cane to the North East region of India. The plant is restricted to only two pockets of Assam with a poor population size. Therefore, conservation of this plant through proper scientific investigation is utmost necessary. The present investigation has as its objectives to study the distribution, estimation of population size, standardization of suitable micropropagation methods for reintroduction and reinforcement in suitable wild habitat as determined by ecological niche modelling (ENM) for the purposes of conservation. For improving the conservation status of the species, potential area and habitat for reintroduction was determined using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) distribution modelling algorithm. The population size in both the site was found to be very poor i.e., mean density, frequency of occurrence and abundance in relation to other associated species was 0.600, 29.26 and 2.307 in Nambor Reserve Forest whereas 0.526, 27.407 and 2.112 respectively in Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary. Macropropagation of C. nambariensis was standardized here through seed germination which was found to be more efficient in terms of time and cost which revealed 87% germination in treated seeds, followed by 61% only for untreated seeds till 90\xc2\xa0days. It was also observed that seedlings in the hilly slope of Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary (reinforcement) showed high survivability than that of the hilly slop of Lahorijan Reserve Forest (reintroduction). Further, survival rate was measured for 24\xc2\xa0months, which revealed significantly very high on an average of 97.85% in both the locations, while 1200 numbers of C. nambariensis plantlets were transferred to the field. The present study could change the population size of C. nambariensis in its natural habitat, proving effective means for preventing extinction and improving conservation status of the plant.'

Abstract: "AbstractBiologists have paid relatively little attention to subterranean predators, especially their ecology. Although diets of some subterranean lower vertebrates suggest specialisation, there remains a lack of quantitative data. The diet of the caecilian amphibian Gegeneophis ramaswamii was investigated through analyses of gut contents of 67 specimens collected in randomised surveys at three localities in Kerala, southern India, in early and mid-monsoon. Although termites were the most frequently ingested items in the mid-monsoon, the specialist predator hypothesis was rejected because of differences in diet found in early monsoon samples, when earthworms contributed the greatest mass. That guts of some G. ramaswamii contained many individuals of only a single dietary taxon was interpreted as feeding on patchily distributed prey rather than specialisation. No ontogenetic differences in diet were apparent, but more sampling is required to investigate this further. Subadults largely feed on fewer items of the same prey as adults, though there is an indication that subadult diet is less diverse. The data do not support differences between male and female diet. High densities of G. ramaswamii, and perhaps of other terrestrial caecilians and subterranean lower vertebrates feeding on soil-ecosystem engineers (termites, earthworms and ants), might substantially impact soil ecology.

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Potential invasion range of bushmint, an invasive plant exotic to India, was modeled.\xe2\x80\xa2MaxEnt predictions were better than GARP in predicting habitats suitable for bushmint.\xe2\x80\xa2Environmental variables defining bushmint\xe2\x80\x99s potential distribution were identified.\xe2\x80\xa2Study identifies areas for taking up surveillance and mitigation measures.AbstractBushmint (Hyptis suaveolens (L.) Poit.) is one among the world's most noxious weeds. Bushmint is rapidly invading tropical ecosystems across the world, including India, and is major threat to native biodiversity, ecosystems and livelihoods. Knowledge about the likely areas under bushmint invasion has immense importance for taking rapid response and mitigation measures. In the present study, we model the potential invasion range of bushmint in India and investigate prediction capabilities of two popular species distribution models (SDM) viz., MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) and GARP (Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Production). We compiled spatial layers on 22 climatic and non-climatic (soil type and land use land cover) environmental variables at India level and selected least correlated 14 predictor variables. 530 locations of bushmint along with 14 predictor variables were used to predict bushmint distribution using MaxEnt and GARP. We demonstrate the relative contribution of predictor variables and species-environmental linkages in modeling bushmint distribution. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess each model's performance and robustness. GARP had a relatively lower area under curve (AUC) score (AUC: 0.75), suggesting its lower ability in discriminating the suitable/unsuitable sites. Relative to GARP, MaxEnt performed better with an AUC value of 0.86. Overall the outputs of MaxEnt and GARP matched in terms of geographic regions predicted as suitable/unsuitable for bushmint in India, however, predictions were closer in the spatial extent in Central India and Western Himalayan foothills compared to North-East India, Chottanagpur and Vidhayans and Deccan Plateau in India."

Title: 'Prediction of high spatio-temporal resolution land surface temperature under cloudy conditions using microwave vegetation index and ANN'
Author: 'H.R.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271616000794
Abstract: 'AbstractLand Surface Temperature (LST) with high spatio-temporal resolution is in demand for hydrology, climate change, ecology, urban climate and environmental studies, etc. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is one of the most commonly used sensors owing to its high spatial and temporal availability over the globe, but is incapable of providing LST data under cloudy conditions, resulting in gaps in the data. In contrast, microwave measurements have a capability to penetrate under clouds. The current study proposes a methodology by exploring this property to predict high spatio-temporal resolution LST under cloudy conditions during daytime and nighttime without employing in-situ LST measurements. To achieve this, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) based models are employed for different land cover classes, utilizing Microwave Polarization Difference Index (MPDI) at finer resolution with ancillary data. MPDI was derived using resampled (from 0.25\xc2\xb0 to 1\xc2\xa0km) brightness temperatures (Tb) at 36.5\xc2\xa0GHz channel of dual polarization from Advance Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR)-Earth Observing System and AMSR2 sensors. The proposed methodology is tested over Cauvery basin in India and the performance of the model is quantitatively evaluated through performance measures such as correlation coefficient (r), Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Results revealed that during daytime, AMSR-E(AMSR2) derived LST under clear sky conditions corresponds well with MODIS LST resulting in values of r ranging from 0.76(0.78) to 0.90(0.96), RMSE from 1.76(1.86)\xc2\xa0K to 4.34(4.00)\xc2\xa0K and NSE from 0.58(0.61) to 0.81(0.90) for different land cover classes. During nighttime, r values ranged from 0.76(0.56) to 0.87(0.90), RMSE from 1.71(1.70)\xc2\xa0K to 2.43(2.12)\xc2\xa0K and NSE from 0.43(0.28) to 0.80(0.81) for different land cover classes. RMSE values found between predicted LST and MODIS LST during daytime under clear sky conditions were within acceptable limits. Under cloudy conditions, results of microwave derived LST were evaluated with air temperature (Ta) and indicate that the approach performed well with RMSE values lesser than the results obtained under clear sky conditions for land cover classes for both day and nighttimes.'

Abstract: 'AbstractObjectiveTo evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of methyl ferulate (MF) isolated from the roots of Stemona tuberosa (S. tuberosa) Lour (Stemonaceae) in lipopolysaccharide activated macrophage cells.MethodsMethanol extracts of a root powder of S. tuberosa were prepared for isolation of a potential anti-inflammatory agent using ultrasound extraction combined with repeated chromatography on silica gel. After the quantitative analyses, anti-inflammatory activity of the isolated compound was evaluated by measurement of cytokine release, NO generation, expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and phosphorylation of mitogen activated protein kinases including p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase using quantitative kits and Western blotting with specific antibodies.ResultsThe isolation process yielded a potential anti-inflammatory compound with a purity level of 99% determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The compound was identified as MF by using nuclear magnetic resonance. MF strongly inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from macrophages, including IL-6, TNF\xce\xb1, IFN\xce\xb3, yet it did not affect the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase were clearly reduced in MF-treated macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. cyclooxygenase-2 expression and NO generation by macrophages were also suppressed when the cells were treated with MF.ConclusionsThe data suggested that MF is a possible inhibitor of the mitogen activated phosphor kinase pathway and could be a potential anti-inflammatory agent isolated for the first time in medicinal plant S. tuberosa.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Palynological study on the Infratrappean sediments from Yeotmal, central India.\xe2\x80\xa2Presence of index palynomorphs of Maastrichtian age.\xe2\x80\xa2Illustrates pre-KT predominant diversified tropical angiosperms and Dipterocarpaceae pollen.\xe2\x80\xa2Suggest existence of shallow marine embayment in central India during Late Cretaceous.AbstractSedimentary deposits of the Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP), of central India are rich in fossil flora and fauna. Based on a new palynological study of Infratrappean deposits from a borehole succession located in the Ashtona village, Yeotmal District, Maharashtra (Wardha Basin), this paper attempts a reconstruction of the Late Cretaceous paleovegetation, paleoecology, depositional environment and paleogeography of central India prior to Deccan volcanism, and also seeks to evaluate the early history and timing of the angiosperm diversification relative to the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) transition. The stratigraphic age of the Infratrappean sequence was determined on the basis of several index palynomorphs (Aquilapollenites, Jigansupollis), Azolla cretacea, Gabonisporis sp, Scollardia conferta of Maastrichtian age. Two new pollen species (Dipterocarpuspollenites cretacea sp. nov., Retiacolpites pigafettaensis sp. nov., and one new dinoflagellate species (Pierceites deccanensis sp. nov.) are described in this study. The numerical abundance of the mangrove pollen Spinizonocolpites pollen (Nypa), combined with the dinoflagellate cyst Pierceites deccanensis, indicates a brackish marine depositional setting close to low-lying coastal forests in central India during the Late Cretaceous. Furthermore, the new evidence presented here from an inland location in the Deccan province strongly suggests the existence of a shallow marine embayment in central India during the late Maastrichtian, which extended from the east coast through the Godavari rift zone, thus adding significantly to the previously described marine signatures from the Upper Cretaceous sequence of Rajahmundry area on the south-eastern coast of peninsular India. The Late Cretaceous fossil pollen of Dipterocarpaceae documented here provides compelling evidence for the evolution of these tropical rain forest elements in the insular India and their dispersal to south east Asia after the initiation of India-Asia collision, consistent with the Out of India hypothesis. The new palynomorph assemblage also has significant implications for our understanding of the floral response to the initiation of Deccan volcanism.'

Title: 'Do developmental initiatives influence local attitudes toward conservation? A case study from the Kalakad\xe2\x80\x93Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, India'

Abstract: "AbstractWe evaluated the conservation attitudes of the local villagers living adjacent to the Kalakad\xe2\x80\x93Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in southern India 6 years after implementation of a World Bank funded eco-development project. We assessed attitudes towards three facets of conservation: the tiger, an emblematic species signifying India's commitment to wildlife conservation; the forest, a principle source of fuel-wood and other products; and the Forest Department, which manages the forest. More specifically we predicted that (i) attitudes would be an effective predictor of resource use interest in the forest and (ii) benefits obtained from the EDP would create more favorable attitudes towards conservation and the protected area employees. Twelve villages located within 3\xc2\xa0km from the reserve boundary were chosen and 2\xe2\x80\x933% of the households interviewed with regard to their attitudes towards these three facets of conservation, their household resource use patterns, wealth, sex, age and length of residency. We found significant associations between wealth, sex, age and both tiger and forest conservation. Providing benefits has not changed the underlying attitudes of the communities. The poorer sections of society, whether receiving benefits or not, tended to support tiger conservation because conserving wildlife did not affect their livelihood in any way, whereas both the rich and poor had misgivings about forest conservation due to dependency on forest products. We conclude that the eco-development project has not effectively addressed the most important of the local concerns."

Abstract: 'AbstractIn an era of human activities, global environmental changes, habitat loss and species extinction, conservation strategies are a crucial step toward minimizing biodiversity loss. For instance, oceans acidification and land use are intensifying in many places with negative and often irreversible consequences for biodiversity. Biodiversity hotspots, despite some criticism, have become a tool for setting conservation priorities and play an important role in decision-making for cost-effective strategies to preserve biodiversity in terrestrial and, to some extent, marine ecosystems. This area-based approach can be applied to any geographical scale and it is considered to be one of the best approaches for maintaining a large proportion of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biological diversity. However, delineating hotspots includes quantitative criteria along with subjective considerations and the risk is to neglect areas, such as coldspots, with other types of conservation value. Nowadays, it is widely acknowledged that biodiversity is much more than just the number of species in a region and a conservation strategy cannot be based merely on the number of taxa present in an ecosystem. Therefore, the idea that strongly emerges is the need to reconsider conservation priorities and to go toward an interdisciplinary approach through the creation of science-policy partnerships.'

Abstract: 'AbstractSurface water hydrography in the Arabian Sea is primarily governed by the Asian monsoon wind system. Changes in the composition of fossil planktic foraminiferal assemblages and sea surface temperatures (SST) in sediment core SK17, retrieved from offshore of central India, are used to decipher past changes in sea-surface hydrographic conditions linked mainly to the winter monsoon winds. The planktic foraminiferal assemblage and the SST records indicate a rapid switch in sea-surface hydrographic conditions around 17.5 ka BP marking the end of last glacial period. The data show that intensified winter winds during 17.5\xe2\x80\x9323.5 ka BP, resulted in nutrient injection into surface waters and eutrophic conditions, mainly through deep vertical mixing and/or moderate upwelling; and reduction in winter wind intensity caused stratification characterized by the high tropical SST since 17.5 ka BP. The timing of the rapid switch in seawater conditions caused by a drop in strength of winter monsoon winds is coeval with the cold climate excursion in the northern hemisphere (Heinrich Event 1), suggesting that the two areas are climatically linked.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper will consider alternative perspectives on the long-term history of shifting cultivation in India and Sri Lanka. Ethnographic and historical accounts of shifting cultivation, often by groups marginal to centres of urbanism and agrarian civilisation, are reviewed. Shifting cultivation persists in hill regions which are more marginal for sedentary, high intensity agriculture and state procurement of taxation. This can be considered as a strategy both to exploit more marginal lands and to avoid state domination. The origins of this historical equilibrium are hypothesized to lie with the expansion of later Neolithic agriculture (4000\xe2\x80\x933000 BP) and the development of hierarchical polities in the Indian plains in the Iron Age (mainly after 3000 BP). The archaeological record of early agriculture indicates that cultivation precedes sedentary villages, suggesting that shifting cultivation may have been a widespread economic system in the Neolithic, in both the Ganges Valley and the Deccan Plateau of South India. These areas are more suited to sedentary cultivation that could support higher population densities. Therefore, as populations grew in the Neolithic the economic system shifted to sedentary agriculture. The expansion of trade networks, hierarchical societies and demographic density pushed shifting cultivation practices into increasingly marginal settings, where this became an interdependent strategy. Specialist hunter\xe2\x80\x93gatherers trading in forest products became an increasingly important aspect of forest exploitation as did cultivation of \xe2\x80\x98cash crop trees\xe2\x80\x99. The potential to detect the effect of some of these processes in archaeological and palynological evidence is explored.'

All these data indicate that the early Paleozoic strata of the Alxa Block were sourced predominantly from Neoproterozoic orogenic belts in the eastern Gondwana continent, instead of the Alxa Block to the north, the North China Block to the east and the North Qilian Orogenic Belt to the south.

Title: 'Assessing recreational fisheries in an emerging economy: Knowledge, perceptions and attitudes of catch-and-release anglers in India'
Author: 'Nishikant'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783615000168
Abstract: "AbstractAcross the globe, catch-and-release (C&R) angling represents a leisure activity indulged by millions. The practice of C&R is commonly advocated by conservation managers because of its potential to protect local fish populations from a range of anthropogenic threats, including over-fishing. In India, C&R angling in fresh waters has a history dating back to colonial times. Despite this, little is known about the current state of the sector. To address this, an online web-based survey was conducted to target C&R anglers who fish in Indian rivers to assess their knowledge, attitudes and perceptions relating to the status of India's freshwater C&R fisheries. From a total of 148 responses, factors such as angling quality (score of 4.6/5.0); aesthetics of surroundings (4.6/5.0), presence of other wildlife (4.4/5.0), fishery management practices (4.6/5.0) and socioeconomic benefits (4.4/5.0) were evaluated. Over 65% (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0148) of the anglers reported an observed decrease in the quality of fishing (e.g. a reduction in the size and/or numbers of fish available for capture). Respondents also considered deforestation (score of 4.2/5.0), water abstraction (4.4/5.0), pollution (4.4/5.0), hydropower projects (4.2/5.0) and destructive fishing techniques (4.7/5.0) as factors which threaten both the habitat and species they target. C&R practitioners were largely united regarding the benefits and willingness to contribute both their time and financial input to support conservation initiatives (score of 4.7/5.0). The current study provides the first overview of the status of C&R angling in India and explores challenges, opportunities, and priorities for future resource management."

Abstract: "AbstractObjectiveTo report the patterns of species diversity, and regenerating capacity in the forest of Nikyal valley in relation to environmental variables and underlying anthropogenic influence.MethodsA study area was selected in a traditionally managed mountain woody pasture during July 2012 to June 2013. The area was sampled by quadrat method. The quadrats were laid down at regular intervals of 150 m. The size of quadrats was kept 10\xc3\x9710, 5\xc3\x975 and 1\xc3\x971 m2 for trees, shrubs and herbs respectively. Density, frequency and cover were recorded. Importance value index of each plant species was calculated and plant communities were named after the plant species having the highest IV. Then diversity, its components and regenerating capacity were calculated with their formulas.ResultsShannon's diversity ranged from 2.75 to 3.31, Simpson's diversity, 0.90 to 0.95; Menhinick's diversity, 0.83 to 1.19; evenness, 0.41 to 0.65; species richness, 4.89 to 6.08 and maturity index, 30 to 44 species distribution pattern. Diversity values were similar to the other Himalayan forests. Pinus roxburghaii was the only regenerating species whereas the remaining four tree species including Qurecus dilatata regenerate up to 100 cm; they are at extreme risk of elimination due to anthropogenic factors.ConclusionsNikyal valley is under severe deforestation pressure for fuel and timber value. There is an urgent need to promote the ethics among the people that improvement and conservation of natural resources are critical for land and soil management."

Title: 'RESEARCH ARTICLEModeling the Potential Geographic Distribution of Black Pepper (Piper nigrum) in Asia Using GIS Tools'
Author: 'Chao-yun'

Abstract: "AbstractKnown as the \xe2\x80\x9cking of spices\xe2\x80\x9d, black pepper (Piper nigrum), a perennial crop of the tropics, is economically the most important and the most widely used spice crop in the world. To understand its suitable bioclimatic distribution, maximum entropy based on ecological niche modeling was used to model the bioclimatic niches of the species in its Asian range. Based on known occurrences, bioclimatic areas with higher probabilities are mainly located in the eastern and western coasts of the Indian Peninsula, the east of Sumatra Island, some areas in the Malay Archipelago, and the southeast coastal areas of China. Some undocumented places were also predicted as suitable areas. According to the jackknife procedure, the minimum temperature of the coldest month, the mean monthly temperature range, and the precipitation of the wettest month were identified as highly effective factors in the distribution of black pepper and could possibly account for the crop's distribution pattern. Such climatic requirements inhibited this species from dispersing and gaining a larger geographical range."

Title: 'Impact of land cover and land use change on runoff characteristics'
Author: 'N.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479714006203
Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The transformation matrix analyses of the land use reveal an appreciable change in forest cover.\xe2\x80\xa2Paddy fields convertion was driven by prevailing economic condition in the state.\xe2\x80\xa2Effect of land use change on runoff does not commensurate with the change in land use.AbstractChange in Land Cover and Land Use (LCLU) influences the runoff characteristics of a drainage basin to a large extent, which in turn, affects the surface and groundwater availability of the area, and hence leads to further change in LCLU. This forms a vicious circle. Hence it becomes essential to assess the effect of change in LCLU on the runoff characteristics of a region in general and of small watershed levels (sub-basin levels) in particular. Such an analysis can effectively be carried out by using watershed simulation models with integrated GIS frame work. SWAT (Soil and Water Analysis Tool) model, being one of the versatile watershed simulation models, is found to be suitable for this purpose as many GIS integration modules are available for this model (e.g. ArcSWAT, MWSWAT). Watershed simulation using SWAT requires the land use and land cover data, soil data and many other features. With the availability of repository of satellite imageries, both from Indian and foreign sources, it becomes possible to use the concurrent local land use and land cover data, thereby enabling more accurate modelling of small watersheds. Such availability will also enable us to assess the effect of LCLU on runoff characteristics and their reverse impact. The current study assesses the effect of land use and land cover on the runoff characteristics of two watersheds in Kerala, India. It also assesses how the change in land use and land cover in the last few decades affected the runoff characteristics of these watersheds. It is seen that the reduction in the forest area amounts to 60% and 32% in the analysed watersheds. However, the changes in the surface runoff for these watersheds are not comparable with the changes in the forest area but are within 20%. Similarly the maximum (peak) value of runoff has increased by an amount of 15% only. The lesser (aforementioned) effect than expected might be due to the fact that forest has been converted to agricultural purpose with major portion as plantations which have comparatively similar characteristics of the forest except for evapo-transpiration. The double sided action (increase in evapo-transpiration owing to species like rubber and increase percolation due to its plantation method by using terracing) might be the reason for relatively smaller effect of the land use change, not commensurate with the changes in the forest area amounting to 60% and 32% for Manali and Kurumali watersheds respectively. Water harvesting methods like rain harvesting ditches can be made mandatory where species with high evapo-transpiration are grown. This action shall enhance the groundwater percolation and shall counter act the effect due to high evapo-transpiration.'

Title: 'Occurrence of parotoid glands in tadpoles of the tropical frog, Clinotarsus curtipes and their role in predator deterrence'
Author: 'Sachin M.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109564331400004X
Abstract: 'AbstractTadpoles of the tropical bicolored frog, Clinotarsus curtipes are unique in having parotoid glands secreting a white viscous fluid and are structurally similar to granular glands from other amphibians. To ascertain the involvement of these glands and their secretion in predator deterrence, it was tested against a predatory fish, Clarias gariepinus, using a paired choice behavioral assay. The results showed that the fish avoid eating C. curtipes tadpoles when paired with tadpoles of a sympatric species, Sylvirana temporalis. While the fish fed on C. curtipes tadpoles whose parotoid glands were surgically removed, did not touch those with intact glands, suggesting a role for the parotoid gland secretion in predator deterrence. Histochemical and biochemical analyses of the gland secretion revealed the presence of high concentrations of proteins, lipids, and alkaloids. SDS-PAGE showed the presence of proteins with prominent bands at 17 and 50\xc2\xa0kDa. The presence of other small molecules (950\xe2\x80\x932000\xc2\xa0amu) as detected by LC\xe2\x80\x93MS showed the presence of five major peaks. Peaks 1 and 2 are probably tetrodotoxin and/or its analogs. Peaks 3 and 5 are possibly bufalin and argininosuccinic acid, respectively while peak 4 remains unidentified. Thus, secretion of parotoid glands of larval C. curtipes contains chemicals which, either alone or in combination, might be responsible for deterring predators.'

Climate is one of the most critical factors affecting biomes and their distribution. The present study assessed shifts in biome types of India using the conceptual framework of Holdridge life zone (HLZ) model, minimum distance classifier and climatic datasets to assess the distribution pattern of potential biomes under climate change scenarios in India. Modelling was conducted on the entire region of India using various combinations; (i) current climate scenario, and, (ii) increased temperature and precipitation scenario. The geographical analysis identifies nineteen (19) HLZs in the Indian sub-continent; seven (7) biomes and nineteen (19) sub-biomes. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the biome map prepared for current climate scenario was 82.73% and 0.75, respectively. With the changes in increasing temperature and precipitation scenario, the modelling results predict significant decrease in the area cover for tropical deserts (plains), tropical desert scrubs (lower montane), tropical moist forests (lower montane) and tropical wet forests (lower montane). Along with these changes, there have been substantial increases in the area cover for tropical dry forests (plains) and tropical very dry forests (plains), especially in central and southern India. The results show shifts from very dry tundra (alvar) to dry tundra (alpine) and moist tundra (alpine) and in some places tropical moist forests (sub-alpine) as well. In central India, decrease in tropical moist forests (lower montane) has been observed, while an increase in the area cover of tropical rain forests (plains) in northeastern India has been observed. It is important to understand the impacts and vulnerabilities of projected climate change on forest ecosystems so that better management and conservation strategies can be adopted for biodiversity and forest dependent communities. The knowledge of impact mechanisms will identify adaptation strategies for some conditions which will help in decreasing the susceptibility to anticipated climate change in the forest sector.'

Title: 'Do community-conserved areas effectively conserve biological diversity? Global insights and the Indian context'
Author: 'Ghazala'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe view that biodiversity-rich areas partially or largely managed by local residents, sometimes referred to as community-conserved areas (CCAs), can be effective in biological conservation has gained considerable ground over the past decade. In this paper, we review available scientific information on the conservation effectiveness of such areas globally. We compiled studies undertaken during the last 5\xc2\xa0years (2004\xe2\x80\x932009) that use quantifiable ecological attributes to: (1) compare CCAs with strictly protected areas (SPAs); (2) compare CCAs with open-access ecosystems and (3) study trends in biological attributes of CCAs over time. We found that there were few consistent differences in diversity/species richness of flora or fauna protected under the two types of management or in deforestation rates. However, CCAs tend to harbour a species complement distinct from that of SPAs and show lowered abundances of monitored taxa that are of conservation importance. CCAs conserve biological values more effectively than open-access areas. Also, biological values tend to decline in CCAs over time. We conclude that CCAs could represent a significant improvement over open-access areas in terms of conservation effectiveness, yet fall short of the needs of comprehensive biological conservation. While extremely few studies have been undertaken in India, the trends seen largely concur with global ones. This review, based on a limited sample size, is only a beginning, and is expected to serve as an invitation for further research to address both the question of biological effectiveness of diverse forest governance regimes as well as the socio-economic, demographic and institutional reasons underlying these differences.'

Abstract: 'AbstractA survey of wild macrofungi associated with temperate evergreen forests of the Bharsar region of the Pauri Garhwal district, Uttarakhand, India, yielded specimens of 12 different species representing ten genera. During the field work, we also collected several fruiting bodies unique to their respective genera. These included (1) a fruiting body with a small cap and long slender stipe belonging to the group of species within the genus Lactarius (subgenus Russularia) characterized by a rusty red cap and white latex; (2) a tall species of Hebeloma with a veil and thin crowded gills, and (3) a species of Hygrocybe that stains black. Due to their special characteristic features, the specimens of Lactarius and Hebeloma are likely to be species new to science, but this requires further investigation. In addition, nine other taxa are briefly described herein, with their major macroscopic features noted. This is the first report of the macrofungal wealth from this diverse forest of the Bharsar region in the Uttarakhand Himalaya, India.'

Abstract: 'AbstractLandscape ecology has brought spatial analysis and geospatial modeling to the forefront of ecological research. In this study, we investigated changes in landscape structure and the ecological consequences of urbanization in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area using spatial indices, change analysis, and geospatial modeling. Major land transformation patterns from 1975 to 2006 were mapped using multi-temporal classification maps. Landscape metrics for 1975, 1986, 1998, and 2006 were calculated and analyzed using Patch Analyst. The deforestation process due to urbanization in the future was modeled using GEOMOD within the framework of 2030 regional land use planning. Results reveal urban area expanded 82% from 1975 to 2006, mainly by displacing forest and agricultural lands by in-filling gaps within the urban area or near its periphery. Leap-frog development was noticeably absent. Many small patches of forest and agriculture located within or near the urban and suburban areas were replaced directly by urban land uses. Urbanization has become ecologically complicated but geometrically simpler whereas the rural landscape became less abundant and diverse. We predict: (1) forest cover will continue to decrease consistently due to on-going urbanization process; and (2) the pattern of deforestation will occur within the urban area due to in-filling and along its periphery as the urban area expands outward into undeveloped areas.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Landscape structure and dynamics were evaluated using landscape indices and GEOMOD. \xe2\x96\xba Large amount of agriculture and forest land were converted to urban land uses since 1975. \xe2\x96\xba Urban in-filling pattern rather than leap-frog development was revealed. \xe2\x96\xba Urban expansion resulted in a geometrically simpler but more complicated urban landscape. \xe2\x96\xba Rural landscape is becoming less abundant with a decrease in the extended ecotones.'

The map was created using an on-screen visual interpretation technique and has an accuracy of 90%, as assessed using 15,565 ground control points. India has hitherto been using potential vegetation/forest type map prepared by Champion and Seth in 1968. We characterized and mapped further the vegetation type distribution in the country in terms of occurrence and distribution, area occupancy, percentage of protected area (PA) covered by each vegetation type, range of elevation, mean annual temperature and precipitation over the past 100 years. A remote sensing-amenable hierarchical classification scheme that accommodates natural and semi-natural systems was conceptualized, and the natural vegetation was classified into forests, scrub/shrub lands and grasslands on the basis of extent of vegetation cover. We discuss the distribution and potential utility of the vegetation type map in a broad range of ecological, climatic and conservation applications from global, national and local perspectives. We used 15,565 ground control points to assess the accuracy of products available globally (i.e., GlobCover, Holdridge\xe2\x80\x99s life zone map and potential natural vegetation (PNV) maps). Hence we recommend that the map prepared herein be used widely. This vegetation type map is the most comprehensive one developed for India so far. It was prepared using 23.5\xc2\xa0m seasonal satellite remote sensing data, field samples and information relating to the biogeography, climate and soil. The digital map is now available through a web portal (http://bis.iirs.gov.in).'

Abstract: "AbstractThe present paper deals with Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level, preparing thematic maps for spatial representation of landscape parameters and then validation of the geospatial model using a three-tier approach, viz., landscape analysis, field data extrapolation and geospatial analysis, for two groups of islands in Indian subcontinent. On-screen visual interpretation approach based on IRS LISS-III and Landsat TM data sets was used to delineate the vegetation communities. Field survey attributes on species diversity, economical/medicinal uses and endemism were suitably linked with satellite image-derived landscape attributes in a geospatial domain. The landscape parameters, viz., fragmentation and disturbance index, clearly indicate that Nicobar Islands are less disturbed compared to Andaman. The phytosociological data of different vegetation types collected from 544 stratified sample points was recorded with ground coordinates. The plant communities of Andaman show high plant diversity in terms of number of species (523 species) and more heterogeneity compared to those of Nicobar (347 species). Biological richness was estimated as a function of six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical and ecological) to stratify forest vegetation in two phytogeographically distinct groups of tropical islands, viz., Andaman and Nicobar, using a customized software, SPLAM.Validation of ecological indices had always been a major challenge for ecologist. Here, we discuss a validation technique using field-driven species regression equations for fragmentation (FR), disturbance (DI) and biological richness (BR) indices and propose improvements in the biological richness methodology. The research question of establishment of linkages between expressions of diversity at different scales is sought and thereby validating the existing model outputs has been proposed. The sensitivity of in-field measurements with landscape parameters has been explicitly analyzed. During validation, the species richness, diversity and mean basal area have shown slow decrease with sudden rise in intermediate levels followed by a steep decline at increasing levels of fragmentation and disturbance. The empirically derived regression coefficient has significant correspondence (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) in terms of community response in both island's groups. The vegetation communities in the forested landscape possess significant linkages with landscape scale processes, viz., FR and DI, as evident by the degree of correlation. The heterogeneity measured as diversity in habit group shows community dimensions in different spatial zones. The generation of baseline data on community ecology allows prioritization of planning process and evolves specific management practices. It may be concluded that the improved biodiversity assessment model and the designed validation techniques have enhanced the reliability of model thus widened the scope for its application in the rapid biodiversity assessment."

Abstract: "AbstractStudy regionIndia.Study focusIndia's groundwater dependence and the crises of depletion and contamination of groundwater resources require the development of a robust groundwater dependence framework. Understanding the challenges of developing a groundwater governance framework for regions of extensive groundwater development versus relatively less-developed areas of groundwater development is important. The groundwater typology is a function of both, the hydrogeological aspects of groundwater and the socio-economic milieu that defines dependency on the groundwater resource, which is significant across users and uses in India.

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Historically there have been several efforts at the aesthetic integration of the river and the city.\xe2\x80\xa2In the recent past, however, the river has become much polluted on account of waste, leading several people to approach the Supreme Court of India for relief.\xe2\x80\xa2The orders issued by the Court display a preference for technological solutions and the removal of riverside encroachments.\xe2\x80\xa2In contrast to the slums which are seen as contributing to waste and pollution, large scale projects, even if on the floodplains, have been deemed to be entirely in order.\xe2\x80\xa2The nature of the threat to the river is of an irreversible kind, necessitating a precautionary approach.AbstractThis essay examines the presence of Yamuna in the city of Delhi, from two perspectives: (i) understanding riverscapes as simultaneously aquatic and terrestrial and (ii) understanding these as conjoining issues of environment and technology. With events over the course of the last century as its backdrop, the essay focuses on the last few decades of the twentieth century, to examine the relation of land and river in Delhi; the interface of people and projects, especially the issue of slums; and the risks posed to the river on account of waste and pollution. All these featured prominently in the events leading up to the staging of the Commonwealth Games in Delhi in October 2010, which provides the most immediate context for this essay. In conclusion, I propose that the current strategies of rejuvenating the river are limited, often anti-poor and far from sustainable.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Institutional framework best suited to manage tourism was assessed for four PAs of the Indian Himalaya.\xe2\x80\xa2Multiple case study analysis using participant observations, focus group discussions & stakeholder analysis was used.\xe2\x80\xa2Weak institutions and governance systems may lead to mass tourism controlled by powerful stakeholders.\xe2\x80\xa2Local institutions with strong intrinsic spatial linkages are most adaptive to challenges of a globalized economy.\xe2\x80\xa2Traditional local institutions assisted by government & NGOs are best suited to achieve Aichi Biodiversity Targets.AbstractTourism has the potential to advance biodiversity conservation through the creation of societal constituency by providing alternative livelihood to resource-dependent communities. Institutional arrangements play a crucial role in ensuring equitable benefit sharing of tourism gains among different stakeholders. We examined this role of institutional arrangements in four National Parks of the Indian Western Himalaya at varying altitude through multiple case study analysis using qualitative methods. Our results suggest that a three-tier setup involving local communities and civil society organizations, supported by enabling government policies is most efficacious in mainstreaming socio-economic development of local communities and environmental concerns in tourism management framework. Strong local institutions with intrinsic spatial linkage are required to ensure maximum benefits to all sections of society and least monetary leakages. We recommend that in natural landscapes with conflicting interests among stakeholders, a hierarchical three-tier institutional arrangement should be encouraged to achieve the goals of sustainable tourism.'

Title: 'ReviewFinding the anthropocene in tropical forests'
Author: 'Patrick'

Abstract: 'AbstractCommonly proposed definitions of the "anthropocene" suggest that significant human alteration of the Earth system is connected to fossil fuel consumption coinciding with the Industrial Revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries, or global change resulting from the "Great Acceleration" following the Second World War. Although evidence for earlier, anthropogenically-driven environmental changes are acknowledged, they are seen as qualitatively different. This perspective is also prevalent in conservation and ecological discussions of human impacts on tropical forests. A growing body of archaeological and historical evidence demonstrates, however, that humans influenced physical, chemical, and biological systems through large regions of tropical forest starting as early as 45,000 years ago. This evidence challenges the idea, prevalent in global scenarios of anthropogenic land cover change, that human influence on tropical forests was limited until the colonial or industrial era. This paper reviews the role of tropical forests in the Earth system and, through a synthesis of archaeological data, critiques the prevailing view of anthropogenic influence on tropical forests in the pre-industrial world. We suggest that any definition of the anthropocene should account for the long history of human modifications to tropical forests. Archaeological and palaeoenvironmental research in these ecosystems is also critical to the broader debates in the social and natural sciences around the onset and utility of the anthropocene concept, and the potential for long-term, sustainable occupation of tropical forest environments.'

Title: 'Micromorphological studies of the complex early Oligocene Himalayan foreland palaeosols in relation to Asian monsoon climate'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Detailed morphological and micromorphological pedofeatures of Oligocene Himalayan palaeosols\xe2\x80\xa2Presence of abundant matrix and intrusive pedofeatures indicative of seasonal climate\xe2\x80\xa2Mature palaeosols specifically show intermixing and/or alternation of carbonates and iron oxides/clays.\xe2\x80\xa2Additional data to explore Indian monsoon climate signatures during early OligoceneAbstractThe Cenozoic Himalayan orogeny not only modified Asia's climate but also affected global climate. One of its significant outcomes is the inception of Asian monsoon climate. Though researchers have shown that changes in Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau elevations control its evolution, however reached no consensus on pre-Miocene timing of monsoon climate inception, perhaps due only limited studies in pre-Miocene Himalayan sediments. Another possibility is that we have restricted our studies in deducing a relationship between Himalayan tectonic upheavals and monsoon climate. However, priority should be to first explore any palaeomonsoon signatures since deposition of Himalayan Foreland Basin (HFB) sediments because some researchers have reported palaeomonsoon signatures during Eocene-Oligocene time. Here we report another such study from early Oligocene Dagshai palaeosols of Subathu sub-basin, India. Detailed morphological and micromorphological studies revealed abundant presence of matrix and intrusive pedofeatures in mature palaeosol profiles. Most striking evidence is the presence of FeMn oxide and carbonate pedofeatures together. The concretions present in the thick Bk horizons having diffuse boundaries show intermixing and/or alternation of calcite and iron oxides. Also occurrence of pedogenic carbonate nodules is not restricted in Bk horizon as is observed in present monsoon dominant regions and nodules are impure, dense and largely micritic, similar to those documented in Indo-Gangetic Holocene soils. Further, most common FeMn oxide nodules are typical, impregnative and associated with granostriated fabric which is indicative of soils formed under seasonal wet and dry cycles. Furthermore, occurrence of illuvial coatings and carbonate together in the B-horizon indicate prevalence of sufficient wet and dry cycles respectively. All these features indicate presence of seasonal climatic conditions and therefore monsoon conditions prevailed during early Oligocene time which is contrary to the most common known Late Miocene age of Indian Monsoon inception."

Title: 'Uncovering an obscure trade: Threatened freshwater fishes and the aquarium pet markets'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We determine the extent, magnitude and conservation implication of trade in endemic and threatened freshwater fishes from India.\xe2\x80\xa2Thirty threatened species comprising a total of 1.5 million individuals were exported during the years 2005-2012.\xe2\x80\xa2Existing local regulations on aquarium fish collections and trade are poorly enforced, and are of no apparent conservation value.\xe2\x80\xa2Unmanaged collections of endemic freshwater fish species is a much more severe threat to freshwater biodiversity than hitherto recognized.AbstractWhile the collection of fish for the aquarium pet trade has been flagged as a major threat to wild populations, this link is tenuous for the unregulated wild collection of endemic species because of the lack of quantitative data. In this paper, we examine the extent and magnitude of collection and trade of endemic and threatened freshwater fishes from India for the pet markets, and discuss their conservation implications. Using data on aquarium fishes exported from India, we try to understand nature of the trade in terms of species composition, volume, exit points, and importing countries. Most trade in India is carried out under a generic label of \xe2\x80\x9clive aquarium fish\xe2\x80\x9d; yet despite this fact, we extracted export data for at least thirty endemic species that are listed as threatened in the IUCN Red List. Of the 1.5\xc2\xa0million individual threatened freshwater fish exported, the major share was contributed by three species; Botia striata (Endangered), Carinotetraodon travancoricus (Vulnerable) and the Red Lined Torpedo Barbs (a species complex primarily consisting of Puntius denisonii and Puntius chalakkudiensis, both \xe2\x80\x98Endangered\xe2\x80\x99). Using the endangered Red Lined Torpedo Barbs as a case study, we demonstrate how existing local regulations on aquarium fish collections and trade are poorly enforced, and are of little conservation value. In spite of the fact that several threatened and conservation concern species are routinely exported, India has yet to frame national legislation on freshwater aquarium trade. Our analysis of the trade in wild caught freshwater fishes from two global biodiversity hotspots provides a first assessment of the trade in endangered and threatened species. We suggest that the unmanaged collections of these endemic species could be a much more severe threat to freshwater biodiversity than hitherto recognized, and present realistic options for management.'

Title: 'Pollination and breeding systems of woody plant species in tropical dry evergreen forests, southern India'
Author: 'K. Geetha'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0367253010000502
Abstract: 'AbstractTropical dry evergreen forests (TDEF) are a unique forest type found along the east coast of India. They mostly occur as small, isolated fragments of varying sizes (0.5 to \xe2\x89\x8810\xc2\xa0ha) and are considered as endangered forests types in peninsular India. Although plant diversity is well documented in these forests, there is a paucity of ecological studies vital for conservation and for planning restoration activities. We studied reproductive biology of 13 woody species: four trees, six shrubs, and three lianas in fragments of TDEF in southern India. The phenology of reproduction, floral biology, anthesis and sexual system of each species were recorded. The pollination mode was assessed through observations of the visitation frequency of pollinators and from the floral characters. The breeding system was determined by hand-augmented self- and cross-pollination experiments. The plants flowered during the dry season from January to July. Plants of nine species had both flowers and fruits at the same time. Twelve species were hermaphrodites and one was polygamo-dioecious. Flowers of 11 species opened at dawn and two at dusk. Four species were self-incompatible and six were self-compatible. Natural fruit set ranged from 10% to 56%, self-incompatible species having low fruit set. Cross-pollen augmentation increased fruit set, suggesting presence of outcrossing in all species. The majority of plants species (85%) had a generalized pollination system, receiving visits from diverse insects, such as social bees, solitary bees, wasps, moths and flies. However, only few of them were functionally important for the species. Two species namely: Capparis brevispina and C. zeylanica had butterflies and birds, respectively, as their main pollinators. Our data reveal that there is a predominance of outcrossing in plant species and a generalized pollination system in these forests. We suggest that restoration of TDEFs is crucial as habitats, not only for wild plants but also for pollinating insects.'

Abstract: 'AbstractCamptothecine, a potent eukaryotic topoisomerase inhibitor, is an important anticancer compound. The global demand for this compound was estimated to be $1\xc2\xa0billion in 2003 and is only further expected to increase. Partly to meet the expected increase in demand, in the recent past, several efforts have been made to discover newer and alternative plant and fungal sources of camptothecine. In this study we report a rich source of camptothecine and its natural derivatives, Pyrenacantha volubilis (Icacinaceae) from the eastern coast of peninsular India. Camptothecine and its derivatives were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) in all plant parts such as twigs, leaves, roots, seedling, ripened whole fruit, fruit coat, seed coat and cotyledons. Cotyledons and ripened whole fruits contained the highest amount of camptothecine (1.35% and 0.60% dry weight respectively). LC-MS and ESI-MS/MS analyses revealed besides camptothecine, other derivatives and precursors such as 10-hydroxycamptothecine, 9-methoxycamptothecine, 20-deoxycamptothecine, deoxypumiloside, strictosidine and strictosamide. Pure camptothecine was isolated from fruits and structurally confirmed using NMR. Seed extracts were found to be effective against breast cancer, ovarian, colon and carcinoma cell lines (with IC50 values of 4.0\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/mL, 6.5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/mL, 25.0\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/mL and 25.0\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/mL respectively). We discuss the results in the context of exploring alternative sources of camptothecine.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (127KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis article contributes to the diversity and stand structure of the mangroves in Kerala, India, using multivariate methods. Floristic diversity of mangroves comprised 18 species of true mangroves, of which\xc2\xa0Sonneratia alba, Avicennia alba, and Ceriops tagal were found to be rare, whereas Bruguiera parviflora was extinct in the state. Structural analyses revealed the importance of Avicennia officinalis and the domination of Acanthus ilicifolius. The mean stem density ranged from 10 to 13846 no/ha, whereas the mean basal area ranged from 0.02 to 20.19\xc2\xa0m2/ha. Multivariate analysis of true mangroves could be classified into five floristic groups based on stem density. Group 1 comprised Rhizophora mucronata, R. apiculata, Ceriops tagal, Kandelia candel, Sonneratia alba, and S.caseolaris, which were seen in the fringing zone. A combination of Group 2 and Group 3 comprised Avicennia marina, A. alba, Lumnitzera racemosa, Acrostichum aureum, Excoecaria agallocha, E.\xc2\xa0indica, Avicennia officinalis, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, and Aegiceras corniculatum, found in the intermediate zone, whereas Bruguiera sexangula and B.\xc2\xa0cylindrica occurred in the landward regions which constituted Group 4. Acanthus ilicifolius, having a widespread distribution, was found in all the three zones represented by Group 5. Tidal elevation was found to be important in shaping the observed zonation.'

Abstract: 'AbstractAttappady is a rural area in Kerala, South India, that has suffered from severe land degradation and which is inhabited by a poor and predominantly tribal population. The combination of severe land degradation, poverty and a tribal population make Attappady hydrologically and socially unique. Ecological degradation and deforestation followed the gradual building up of land pressure resulting from immigration by more wealthy outsiders. The hills of Attappady were once the forest land of Kerala. Recently it was on the verge of complete degradation.This paper explains how an ecorestoration project involving soil and water conservation interventions, the introduction of agro-forestry, nutritional diversification, income generation activities and training was implemented in a participatory manner. The project had positive impacts on both the environment and the livelihoods of the people living in the watershed, but it also suffered from drawbacks. This paper reports on the successes as well as the lessons learned from this unique ecorestoration project.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba We report on a successful eco-restoration project implemented with people\xe2\x80\x99s participation in a rural tribal area in Kerala. \xe2\x96\xba Successful reports of complex eco-restoration projects are rare, particularly within a complex institutional setting. \xe2\x96\xba Of course there were also many set-backs and difficulties which are reported on in a lessons-learned section.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe spatio-temporal variations of the \xce\xb413C and \xce\xb415N of suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM), along with ancillary chemical and hydrographic parameters, have been examined monthly for one year (October 2010 to September 2011) at a total of seven stations to refine the understanding of SPOM sources and biogeochemical pathways in the tropical Zuari Estuary, west coast of India. The dynamic nature of C and N cycling in estuaries is reflected in the isotopic variation of SPOM as a function of space and time. The results exhibit marked seasonality, with the autochthonous component and the terrestrial component being the major SPOM sources during periods of low and high river discharges, respectively. Spatially, enrichments of \xce\xb413C and \xce\xb415N from the head (\xce\xb413C\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa029.6\xe2\x80\xb0, \xce\xb415N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01.78\xe2\x80\xb0, C/N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa07.09) to the mouth (\xce\xb413C\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa020.9\xe2\x80\xb0, \xce\xb415N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa05.77\xe2\x80\xb0, C/N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa06.12) of the estuary indicate downstream reduction of terrigenous influence. The mean C:N ratios varied between 4 and 9 over the study period with low values during the monsoon, in spite of large terrestrial input, which can be attributed to microbial modification of terrestrial SPOM. A significant positive correlation of \xce\xb413C with salinity suggests the reliability of \xce\xb413C as a biogeochemical tracer for organic matter provenance. Carbon:chlorophyll plots reveal suppressed autochthonous production during the southwest monsoon which may be attributed to the rapid flushing time, light-limitation due to cloud cover and high water-column turbidity.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe ecomorphological aspects of murine rodent dentition were analyzed by comparing the relationship between fossils and their extant counterparts. Another aspect explored is the broad correlation of species richness vs rainfall and temperature data of an area. Integration of these results has provided a broad picture of the monsoonal conditions (rainfall, temperature and vegetation) prevailing during the Late Middle Miocene to Late Miocene (13\xe2\x80\x936.4\xc2\xa0Ma) and Pliocene (\xe2\x88\xbc5\xe2\x80\x931.8\xc2\xa0Ma) times in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. Terminal Pleistocene Kurnool Cave murine fauna also provides some clues regarding the past climatic conditions in this part of Andhra Pradesh. The results indicate that the Late Miocene possibly had monsoonal conditions quite different from that of the present day, as none of the extant taxa cluster with the Late Miocene taxa. The northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent received rainfall between 1000 and 2000\xc2\xa0mm in the Early Pliocene (5\xe2\x80\x934\xc2\xa0Ma) and that in the Late Pliocene was between 2000 and 4000\xc2\xa0mm. Late Pliocene diversity of murine rodents reflects the existence of a diverse spectrum of ecological niches, mainly open grassland/savanna conditions interspersed with dry/wet deciduous and semi-evergreen forests. Terminal Pleistocene around Kurnool Caves (Andhra Pradesh) was relatively drier compared to the Pliocene with rainfall ranging between 600 and 1000\xc2\xa0mm.'

Abstract: 'AbstractTo examine management options for biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, eight research regions were classified into social-ecological domains, using a dataset of indicators of livelihood resources, i.e., capital assets. Potential interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture were then compared among landscapes and domains. The approach combined literature review with expert judgment by researchers working in each landscape. Each landscape was described for land use, rural livelihoods and attitudes of social actors toward biodiversity and intensification of agriculture. Principal components analysis of 40 indicators of natural, human, social, financial and physical capital for the eight landscapes showed a loss of biodiversity associated with high-input agricultural intensification. High levels of natural capital (e.g. indicators of wildland biodiversity conservation and agrobiodiversity for human needs) were positively associated with indicators of human capital, including knowledge of the flora and fauna and knowledge sharing among farmers. Three social-ecological domains were identified across the eight landscapes (Tropical Agriculture-Forest Matrix, Tropical Degrading Agroecosystem, and Temperate High-Input Commodity Agriculture) using hierarchical clustering of the indicator values. Each domain shared a set of interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture and ecological intensification that could also increase food security in the impoverished landscapes. Implementation of interventions differed greatly among the landscapes, e.g. financial capital for new farming practices in the Intensive Agriculture domain vs. developing market value chains in the other domains. This exploratory study suggests that indicators of knowledge systems should receive greater emphasis in the monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and that inventories of assets at the landscape level can inform adaptive management of agrobiodiversity-based interventions.Graphical abstractDownload full-size imageHighlights\xe2\x96\xba Biodiversity supports the ecological intensification of agriculture. \xe2\x96\xba Agricultural landscapes can be monitored in terms of livelihood resources (capital assets). \xe2\x96\xba Natural capital is associated with local knowledge systems, not financial capital. \xe2\x96\xba Biodiversity-based interventions can be targeted for different social-ecological domains. \xe2\x96\xba Ecological intensification is knowledge-intensive and context-specific.'

Title: 'Original research articleSeparation of the bioclimatic spaces of Himalayan tree rhododendron species predicted by ensemble suitability models'
Author: 'Sailesh'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989414000067
Abstract: 'AbstractThe tree rhododendrons include the most widely distributed Himalayan Rhododendron species belonging to the subsection Arborea. Distributions of two members of this sub-species were modelled using bioclimatic data for current conditions (1950\xe2\x80\x932000). A subset of the least correlated bioclimatic variables was used for ecological niche modelling (ENM). We used an ENM ensemble method in the BiodiversityR R-package to map the suitable climatic space for tree rhododendrons based on 217 point location records. Ensemble bioclimatic models for tree rhododendrons had high predictive power with bioclimatic variables, which also separated the climatic spaces for the two species. Tree rhododendrons were found occurring in a wide range of climate and the distributional limits were associated with isothermality, temperature ranges, temperature of the wettest quarter, and precipitation of the warmest quarter of the year. The most suitable climatic space for tree rhododendrons was predicted to be in western Yunnan, China, with suitability declining towards the west and east. Its occurrence in a wide range of climatic settings with highly dissected habitats speaks to the adaptive capacity of the species, which might open up future options for their conservation planning in regions where they are listed as threatened.'

Based on the expressed population signal (EPS) statistic, our record is reliable only back to 1945C.E., however this study clearly establishes the dendroclimatic potential of this tropical broadleaf species to carry out future tree\xe2\x80\x93ring based long\xe2\x80\x93term climate reconstruction in the sub-tropical Himalaya.'

Abstract: 'AbstractDevelopment of regional biome models represents a new stage of earth systems modeling. By translating simulated climate variables and actual vegetation boundaries into maps of biomes, these models explicitly link the vegetation and climate patterns together, enabling the determination of trajectories of climate change. Through this research, a new one million scale biome map of India is prepared, based on actual vegetation cover type map derived from wide field sensor onboard Indian remote sensing satellite (IRS WiFS\xe2\x80\x94spatial resolution 200\xc2\xa0m) and Holdridge life zone (HLZ) system. A biome level characterization (BLC) model has been developed wherein, temporal satellite data helps to define the phenologically discriminant vegetation cover type, climatic parameters viz., biotemperature, mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration ratio have been used to identify potential life zones and finally describe the biome boundaries based on the vegetation cover type and life zones. The study identifies 35 cover classes and describes 17 vegetation cover types. This is close to the type description given by Champion and Seth [Champion, H.G., Seth, S.K., 1968. A Revised Survey of Forest Types of India. New Delhi Government Publication, New Delhi.] in their forest cover type map. The geographical analysis identifies 19 HLZs seven biomes and 19 sub-biomes in the Indian sub-continent. The dataset is now available for diverse application studies in ecosystem modeling, land cover dynamics and global change.'

Title: 'Research PaperEstimating soil fertility status in physically degraded land using GIS and remote sensing techniques in Chamarajanagar district, Karnataka, India'

Abstract: 'AbstractSoil physical degradation is a major environmental problem throughout the world due to its negative impact on biomass and economic production. This study presented new ways of combining rapid soil analysis using GIS and remote sensing imagery to provide a precision mapping of soil physical condition indicators in the study area and producing fertility status using Geostatistical approach. Study has been carried out to map the areas with physical degradation using remotely sensed data from Indian Remote Sensing LISS III sensor. It was observed that the data enabled better delineation of small units of eroded areas. Satellite data have been used for qualitative assessment of areas, being subject to soil erosion. Soil erosion was found to be none or slight to very sever using visual interpretation of IRS data along with field survey method where soil erosion was found to be moderate to high using the RUSLE method. The eroded areas of degraded lands will be used as an input for planning reclamation and conservation programs in Chamarajanagar district of Karnataka.Soil compaction is a form of physical degradation resulting in densification and distortion of the soil where biological activity, porosity and permeability are reduced, strength is increased and soil structure partly destroyed. Compaction can reduce water infiltration capacity and increase erosion risk by accelerating run-off. The compaction process can be initiated by wheels, tracks, rollers or by the passage of animals. Some soils are naturally compacted, strongly cemented or have a thin topsoil layer on rock subsoil. Soils can vary from being sufficiently strong to resist all likely applied loads to being so weak that they are compacted by even light loads.'

Title: 'Assessment of relation of land use characteristics with vector-borne diseases in tropical areas'
Author: 'A.M.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837715301915
Abstract: 'AbstractLand use and land cover changes play an important role in the occurrence of vector-borne diseases. It is highly essential to identify the prominent changes responsible for its occurrence so that suitable measures can be adopted. An attempt was made to identify the prominent land use and land cover changes responsible for the spread of chikungunya, malaria, and dengue fever in the State of Kerala, India, using hierarchical cluster analysis and multiple regression analysis. Large extent of water bodies, low land and agricultural land played a significant role on the incidence of chikungunya and malaria. High population density, built-up area and agricultural area favoured dengue fever. Vector-borne diseases were found to be the lowest in places where there is no low land and with higher forest area. Inappropriate disposal of wastes generated in the built-up area might be the reason for the spread of dengue fever. Freshwater in drains of these areas is polluted and form breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Hence much attention is to be paid to provide appropriate treatment and disposal of wastes generated in the built-up area of the State In an evolving urban policy, priority is to be given to the installation of safe treatment and disposal facility of wastes especially, sewage, sullage, and solid waste. The protection of forest land also plays an important role. Economic policy instruments such as Payment for Environment Services (PES) schemes, may constitute a useful tool to encourage an improved land use management through appropriate price signals, such as, for instance, for the preservation of forested areas especially in proximity of highly populated urban environments.'

Title: 'Vegetation responses along edge-to-interior gradients in a high altitude tropical forest in peninsular India'
Author: 'Shibu'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112796038364
Abstract: 'AbstractA study was conducted in a high altitude tropical forest (shola forest) in peninsular India to examine the changes in floristic composition (mainly woody species regeneration) along an edge to interior gradient in relation to changes in edaphic and microenvironmental factors. Species inventory was taken in 25 m2 plots, established at 10 m intervals along edge to interior transects. The measured soil variables included pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and soil moisture. Microenvironmental factors including light transmittance, relative humidity, and air and soil temperatures also were monitored. Both edaphic and microenvironmental factors exhibited strong patterns along the edge to interior gradient. Forest edges were characterized by higher light transmittance, higher air and soil temperatures, and lower relative humidity. Soil variables including pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and moisture increased toward the forest interior. Significant increases in organic carbon (53.9%), total nitrogen (47%), and soil moisture (55%) indicated a relatively fertile forest interior compared with the forest edge. A definite floristic compositional pattern also was observed along the edge to interior gradient which was correlated to the edaphic and microenvironmental variables as revealed by canonical correspondence analysis. It appears that edge effects in these high altitude forests penetrate to a distance of 15\xe2\x80\x9330 m. Further, edaphic factors have an important influence on woody species regeneration, perhaps much more than microenvironmental factors. This indicates that any disturbance that significantly exposes theforest floor, thus lowering soil moisture and altering soil nutrient status, can adversely affect the regeneration of many of the shola species.'

Abstract: 'AbstractAmbient aerosol samples, collected from Mangalore region in the southwest coast of India during the period of late winter (February and March) to early summer (April and May), have been analysed for water-soluble ionic species. Their abundance pattern is dominated by HCO3\xe2\x88\x92, SO42\xe2\x88\x92, Na+, Cl\xe2\x88\x92, with minor contribution from NO3\xe2\x88\x92, Ca2+, NH4+, K+ and Mg2+ indicating the contribution from not only sea salt, but also from anthropogenic and dust sources; with pronounced seasonal variability. The suspended particulate matter concentration varied from 35 to 160\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x923, with consistently higher values during the late winter. Back trajectory analysis suggests the origin of the air masses shifting from Indo-Gangetic Plains (during late winter) to those from the Arabian Sea and the area around Persian Gulf during April\xe2\x80\x93May. Air masses passing over Northern India (Indo-Gangetic Plains) impart characteristic contribution of ionic species from fossil fuel combustion, biomass burning and eolian dust as asserted by the factor analysis. A detailed study on characterisation of aerosols from south Asian region is rather sparse but essential for modelling the effect of tropospheric aerosols on climate.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper is a case study of the contemporary changes that affect the Sanjay Gandhi National Park and its surroundings in the city of Mumbai. It cross-examines the relationships between urban nature and urban space in the case of a city of the South. We argue that the issue of equitable access to urban nature is embedded in the larger question of the Right to the City. We show how processes of urban growth that lead to a shrinking of the forested area are associated with a differentiation of the Right to the City, rather than a general consolidation of claims on space. Defence of the park is mobilised to redefine urban citizenship and leads to a form of graduated citizenship. This differentiates those who see their claims on urban space consolidated; those whose urban citizenship is degraded, and those for whom urban citizenship is denied.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba The Sanjay Gandhi National Park is located within the 20 million metropolis of Mumbai. \xe2\x96\xba No collaboration between park and city management has led to slum settlement within the park. \xe2\x96\xba We analyse the urban dwellers (\xe2\x80\x9ctribals\xe2\x80\x9d, slums, middle classes) in the park. \xe2\x96\xba The Right to the City is redefined in relation to environment. \xe2\x96\xba The urban political ecology framework is refined by our research at the local scale.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We tested the utility of two marine metrics to detect stress in lotic systems.\xe2\x80\xa2The both tested indices are correlated with water and habitat quality gradients.\xe2\x80\xa2The utility of TDI as a potential metric in bioassessment programs is limited.\xe2\x80\xa2The ABC method could be proposed as a novel metric, but with certain limitations.AbstractMultimetric approaches are commonly used to evaluate the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems. However, it has been recommended that the sensitivity of existing methods be improved through the investigation of the potential of new metrics to detect environmental disturbances. In this study we tested the effectiveness of two community indices (Taxonomic distinctness index (TDI) and Abundance biomass comparison (ABC) method), primarily proposed for marine ecosystems, to identify sites with different levels of environmental degradation in lotic systems using fish community data. Fish samples were collected over the period 2003\xe2\x80\x932011 at 131 sampling stations. To generate water and habitat quality classes, a self-organizing map (SOM) based on environmental data was applied. Gradients over the SOM map were investigated for the values of the TDI and ABC indices. The results of this study reveal that the values of both the TDI and ABC indices are highly correlated with water and habitat quality gradients. However, despite the observed correlation, the utility of TDI as a potential metric in bioassessment programs is rather limited, due to its lack of discriminatory power. In contrast, the ABC method could be proposed as a novel metric, but can only be applied in type-specific multimetric approaches.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (156KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Amphibian conservation, land-use changes and protected areas: A global overview'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2In the last 10\xc2\xa0years the numbers of protected areas (PA) and unprotected amphibian species have increased.\xe2\x80\xa2This paradox led to a quarter of living amphibians totally unrepresented in the global network of PAs.\xe2\x80\xa265% of unprotected amphibians live in human-dominated landscapes.\xe2\x80\xa2Most unprotected amphibian species are currently classified as Data Deficient by the IUCN.AbstractAmphibians are undergoing a global conservation crisis, and they are one of the most underrepresented groups of vertebrates in the global network of protected areas (PAs). In this study, we evaluated the ability of the world's PAs to represent extant amphibian species. We also estimated the magnitude of the human footprint along the geographic distributions of gap species (i.e., those with distributions totally outside PAs). Twenty-four percent of species (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01535) are totally unrepresented, and another 18% (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01119) have less than 5% of their distribution inside PAs. Nearly half of all species with ranges under 1000\xc2\xa0km2 do not occur inside any PA. Furthermore, more than 65% of the distribution of gap species is in human-dominated landscapes. Although the Earth's PAs have greatly increased during the last ten years, the number of unprotected amphibians has also grown. Tropical countries in particular should strongly consider (1) the importance of using amphibians to drive conservation policies that eventually lead to the implementation and management of PAs, given amphibians' extinction risk and ability to act as bioindicators; (2) the effectiveness of national recovery plans for threatened amphibian species; and (3) the need for increased funding for scientific research to expand our knowledge of amphibian species. Meanwhile, data-deficient amphibian species should receive a higher priority than they usually receive in conservation planning, as a precautionary measure. Throughout this paper, we point out several challenges in creating more comprehensive amphibian conservation strategies and opportunities in the next decade."

Abstract: 'AbstractThe community structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in the roots of drought-resistant trees, Moringa spp., was examined in semiarid regions in Madagascar and Uganda. Root samples were collected from 8 individuals of M. hildebrandtii and 2 individuals of M. drouhardii in Madagascar and from 21 individuals of M. oleifera in Uganda. Total DNA was extracted from the root samples, and partial nSSU rDNA of AM fungi was amplified using a universal eukaryotic primer NS31 and an AM fungalspecifi c primer AM1. The PCR products were cloned and divided by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with HinfI and RsaI. Some representatives in each RFLP types were sequenced, and a neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis was conducted for the obtained sequences with analogous sequences of AM fungi. The RFLP and phylogenetic analyses showed that AM fungi closely related to Glomus intraradices or G. sinuosum were detected in many samples. The AM fungal groups frequently detected in the Moringa spp. might be widely distributed species in semiarid environments.'

Abstract: 'AbstractWe present here a pollen record from the northern Indian Ocean that goes back to 200 ka, the boundary between marine isotopic stages (MIS) 7 and 6. Pollen, oxygen-isotopic composition and organic carbon have been examined for two sediment cores from the eastern Arabian Sea (15\xc2\xb002\xe2\x80\xb2N and 71\xc2\xb041\xe2\x80\xb2E, 13\xc2\xb016\xe2\x80\xb2N and 71\xc2\xb000\xe2\x80\xb2E), to reconstruct the long-term palaeoclimate and palaeovegetation of the Indian subcontinent. Oxygen-isotope data suggest that glacial periods (MIS 2, 4 and 6) are characterised by low precipitation because of a weak southwest monsoon and a strong northeast monsoon. In contrast, interglacial periods (MIS 1, 3 and 5) are marked by high fresh water input resulting from a strong southwest monsoon. During the last glacial\xe2\x80\x93interglacial cycle, sea-surface temperature and surface salinity changed as a result of variations in the evaporation\xe2\x80\x93precipitation (E\xe2\x80\x93P) balance. Throughout the core, the dominant pollen types are Poaceae and Chenopodiaceae and/or Amaranthaceae (>50%). Their dominance during glacial periods (MIS 2, 4 and 6) suggests that the climate was cold and dry. This dominance is also suggestive of salinity-tolerant vegetation colonizing large areas near seashore due to lower sea level or high E\xe2\x80\x93P conditions. During interglacial periods (MIS 1, 3 and 5) when there was high precipitation, the arid taxa were sparse, whereas Poaceae and Piperaceae were abundant. Hence, Chenopodiaceae and/or Amaranthaceae and Artemisia are suggestive of cold and arid/semi-arid climate, and Poaceae and Piperaceae of warm and wet conditions. Mangrove pollen is not well represented in the cores.'

Sediments were baited with sterile banyan (Ficus benghalensis) leaf disks followed by conidial induction in bubble chambers. Species richness as well as conidial output were higher during the wet than dry season, while it was opposite for diversity. Anguillospora longissima, Cylindrocarpon sp. and Flagellospora curvula were common among the top five spore producers in both seasons. During the wet season, species richness was higher in sandy clay loam sediments than in loam and sandy loam sediments, while species similarity showed a decreasing trend from loam\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0sandy clay loam\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0sandy loam sediments. This corresponds to greater dispersal ability of filiform conidia than branched conidia in sediments.

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Largest pilgrimage on earth increased nutrient fluxes in the Pamba River\xe2\x80\xa2Synthetic N and P fertilizer application rates much higher than in world rivers\xe2\x80\xa2Manure N and P application rates much lower than in world rivers\xe2\x80\xa2Inorganic N and P yields in the catchment are moderate to low on a global scaleAbstractAnthropogenic inputs nowadays are the major source of nutrients to the coastal area. While a wealth of data exists from high latitude regions, little is known on the amount and composition of nutrient fluxes from densely populated tropical catchments. The South Indian Pamba River is a prime example in this respect because of its manifold human interventions such as the Sabarimala pilgrimage, the largest pilgrim centre in the world and agricultural practices. In order (i) to identify direct cause-effect relationships, (ii) to quantify land use specific nutrient inputs and (iii) to assess the respective impacts water was sampled along the river course during the pre monsoon, south west monsoon and north east monsoon periods in 2010 to 2012. Sampling segments were chosen according to prevailing land use. A socioeconomic survey on agricultural practices was conducted to collect information on the type, time and quantity of fertilizer application.Our results indicate (i) little human activities in the forest segment resulted in a low nutrient yield; (ii) pilgrim activities led to high ammonium and phosphate yields in the temple segment; (iii) specific fertilizer management resulted in moderate and maximum nitrate yields in the respective agriculture segments.

Title: 'Predicting the impact of climate change on regional and seasonal abundance of the mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) using temperature-driven phenology model linked to GIS'
Author: 'Babasaheb B.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Temperature-based phenology model of Phenacoccus solenopsis is simulated spatially.\xe2\x80\xa2Increased geographical suitability at higher latitudes is predicted due to climate change.\xe2\x80\xa2Additional 2.0 generations per year are predicted in tropics and sub-tropics.\xe2\x80\xa2The cotton losses in India are predicted to increase to million US$ 1764.85by the year 2050.AbstractThe mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) is a highly invasive and polyphagous pest of global incidence. The fundamental hypothesis of the present study was that the temperature variations due to global climate change may affect seriously the future distribution and abundance of P. solenopsis, which might further aggravate the crop yield losses. We employed a temperature-based phenology model of P. solenopsis in a geographic information system for mapping population growth potentials of P. solenopsis. The three risk indices viz., establishment risk index, generation index and activity index were computed using interpolated temperature data from worldclim database for current (2000) and future (2050) climatic conditions. The daily minimum and maximum temperature data from four selected weather stations in India were used for analysing within-year variation of pest population. A linear relationship was established between the activity indices and yield losses at various locations reported in literatures for predicting the future trend of yield loss due to climate change. The results revealed that, under current temperature conditions P. solenopsis can complete >4.0 generations per year on \xe2\x88\xbc80% of the global cotton production areas. Economic losses are likely to occur in areas where at least 8.0 generations can develop in a year; under current climate \xe2\x88\xbc40% areas fall under this category. The increased geographical suitability at higher latitudes in cotton production areas, additional 2.0 generations per year, and 4.0 fold increase of population abundance of P. solenopsis are expected in tropical and sub-tropical cotton areas of Brazil, South Africa, Pakistan and India due to predicted climate change. Analysis of within year population increase at various selected locations in India revealed that, P. solenopsis attained maximum potential population increase during the major cotton growing season (May\xe2\x80\x93June to October\xe2\x80\x93November). On the other hand, the innate ability of P. solenopsis population to increase reduced considerably during off season and cooler winter months. The increased pest activity of P. solenopsis due to climate change may intensify the losses in cotton yield, with forecasted losses in India to increase from existing losses of million US$ 1217.10 to future losses of million US$ 1764.85 by the year 2050. Here, we illustrate the possible impact of climate change on future P. solenopsis exacerbation based on temperature-driven population studies, which will help in undertaking agro-ecoregion specific management strategies.'

Abstract: "AbstractEndophytic fungi from Nyctanthes arbor-tristis were isolated and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. A total of 19 endophytic fungi were isolated from 400 segments of healthy leaf and stem tissues of N. arbortristis. Eighteen endophytic fungi were obtained from leaf, while only ten from stem. Alternaria alternata had the highest colonization frequency (15.0%) in leaf, whereas Cladosporium cladosporioides ranked first in stem with a colonization frequency of 12%. The diversity and species richness were found higher in leaf tissues than in stem. The similarity indices between leaf and stem were 0.473 for Jaccard's and 0.642 for the Sorenson index, respectively. Of 16, 12 (75%) endophytic fungal extracts showed antibacterial activity against either one or more pathogenic bacteria. The endophytic Nigrospora oryzae showed maximum inhibition against Shigella sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The leaf endophytes Colletotrichum dematium and Chaetomium globosum exhibited a broad range of anibacterial activity and were active against Shigella flexnii, Shigella boydii, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella paratyphi, and P. aeruginosa. Nine out of 16 (56.25%) endophytic fungi exhibited antifungal activity to one or more fungal pathogens. Colletotrichum dematium inhibited 55.87% of the radial growth of the phytopathogen Curvularia lunata. The antimicrobial activity of these endophytic microorganisms could be exploited in the biotechnological, medicinal, and agricultural industries."

Abstract: 'AbstractThe identity and distribution of the prevalent member species of the Anopheles dirus complex mosquitoes in the north-eastern region of India was investigated in a cross-sectional study. We altogether collected 267 individuals of An. dirus s.l. from 27 forested/forest fringed locations spread across the seven north-eastern states, identified the species using a ribosomal DNA (r-DNA) second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) based allele specific polymerase chain reaction (ASPCR) method and sequenced the ITS2 locus in a sub set of mosquitoes. An. baimaii was identified as the main, almost exclusive (266/267), species of the Dirus complex throughout the north-east India with no intraspecific variation in the 479 base pair long ITS2 sequences in 59 of the 60 individuals sequenced. Ribosomal DNA of one individual from Assam state did not amplify in the ASPCR, possessed 786 base pair long ITS2 sequence and showed 99.7% similarity with the sequence of An. dirus species D (An. baimaii) from Yunnan province of China, later referred to as species X of the Dirus complex. These observations suggest the presence of another, possibly the new, species of the Dirus complex, sympatric with An. baimaii, in Assam warranting investigations on its distribution, biology and role in human malaria transmission in north-east India.Graphical abstractAn. baimaii was identified as the most prevalent, almost exclusive, species of the Dirus complex with evidence of one more species, similar to Species X of China, in north-east India.Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractLarge investments are being made in the establishment of tree plantations on degraded land in Asia. These initiatives are often politically driven and aspire to achieve both economic and environmental benefits. However, the lack of clarity about the precise objectives of these schemes means that they often fail to yield either local economic or global environmental benefits. There is often a failure to negotiate with all concerned stakeholders and to recognize and resolve trade-offs. Subsidies have often had perverse impacts, and market forces may be better drivers of economic objectives of restoration programmes. Security of tenure and use rights is an important but often neglected requirement for achieving sustainability. Remnant patches of natural vegetation, even when degraded, are often valuable sources of local biodiversity in restoration schemes. The spatial patterns of different types of forest and of non-forest land are important determinants of environmental values. Biodiversity conservation requires maintaining or re-establishing habitat strips to connect natural forest blocks and protect ecological gradients. However, even monoculture plantations often have significant biodiversity value. The fundamental principles of ecosystem approaches as adopted by the Convention for the Conservation of Biological Diversity and principles for successful common property resource management provide valuable frameworks for forest restoration schemes.'

Title: 'Influence of air mass trajectories on the chemical composition of precipitation in India'
Author: 'M.'

Abstract: 'AbstractChemical composition of precipitation was measured with wet-only samplers at a rural site at Bhubaneswar in eastern India during 1997\xe2\x80\x931998. All rain events were compared with trajectories and precipitation fields from the ECMWF. The pH and ionic concentrations were found to vary systematically with the origin of air and the amount of rainfall along the trajectory. A seasonal cycle for pH was found with a monthly median pH below 5.0 during October\xe2\x80\x93December. The highest monthly median concentration of Ca2+ was found in May with 20\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcmol\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 and for SO42\xe2\x88\x92 in January with 52\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcmol\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921. Samples with trajectories within 400\xc2\xa0km from Bhubaneswar during the last 5 days were found to have a median pH slightly below 5.0 as an average. These samples also had the highest concentration for all measured ions, indicating large pollution sources within the region. Samples with continental origin showed a decrease of \xe2\x88\xbc70% in concentration if there had been rain during >50% of the last 5 days compared to rain during <50% of the last 5 days. High concentrations of Na+ and Cl\xe2\x88\x92 were also found in continental samples. Resuspension of previously deposited sea salt is believed to be the reason. The data were compared with data from three other sites in western India and higher concentrations of almost all ions (NH4+ being the exception) compared to Bhubaneswar were found at the west coast in monsoon samples.'

Title: 'Biophysical and anthropogenic controls of forest fires in the Deccan Plateau, India'
Author: 'V. Krishna'

Abstract: 'AbstractForest fires constitute one of the most serious environmental problems in several forested regions of India. In the Indian sub-continent, relatively few studies have focused on the assessment of biophysical and anthropogenic controls of forest fires at a landscape scale and the spatial aspects of these relationships. In this study, we used fire count data sets from satellite remote sensing data covering 78 districts over four different states of the Deccan Plateau, India, for assessing the underlying causes of fires. Spatial data for explanatory variables of fires pertaining to topography, vegetation, climate, anthropogenic and accessibility factors have been gathered corresponding with fire presence/absence. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the probability of the presence of fires as a function of the explanatory variables. Results for fire area estimates suggested that, of the total fires covering 47,043km2 that occurred during the year 2000 for the entire Indian region, 29.0% occurred in the Deccan Plateau, with Andhra Pradesh having 13.5%, Karnataka 14.7%, Kerala 0.1%, and Tamilnadu 1.15%. Results from the logistic regression suggest that the strongest influences on the fire occurrences were the amount of forest area, biomass densities, rural population density (PD), average precipitation of the warmest quarter, elevation (ELE) and mean annual temperature (MAT). Among these variables, biomass density (BD) and average precipitation of the warmest quarter had the highest significance, followed by others. These results on the best predictors of forest fires can be used both as a strategic planning tool to address broad scale fire risk concerns, and also as a tactical guide to help forest managers to design fire mitigation measures at the district level.'

Title: 'Rohitukine, a chromone alkaloid and a precursor of flavopiridol, is produced by endophytic fungi isolated from Dysoxylum binectariferum Hook.f and Amoora rohituka (Roxb).Wight & Arn'

Abstract: 'AbstractRohitukine, a chromone alkaloid, has gained considerable international attention in recent years because of its novel semi-synthetic derivative, flavopiridol and P-276-00. Both these molecules are in advanced stages of clinical development and trial for cancer treatment. Recently, flavopiridol was approved as an orphan drug for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cancer. The natural occurrence of rohitukine is restricted to only four plant species, Amoora rohituka and Dysoxylum binectariferum (both from the Meliaceae family) and from Schumanniophyton magnificum and Schumanniophyton problematicum (both from the Rubiaceae family). Recently, an endophytic fungi isolated from D. binectariferum was reported to produce rohitukine in culture. In this study, we report the production of rohitukine and its subsequent attenuation by endophytic fungi, Fusarium oxysporum (MTCC-11383), Fusarium oxysporum (MTCC-11384) and Fusarium solani (MTCC-11385), all isolated from D. binectariferum and Gibberella fujikuroi (MTCC-11382) isolated from Amoora rohituka. The fungal rohitukine which was analyzed by HPLC, LC\xe2\x80\x93MS and LC\xe2\x80\x93MS/MS was identical to reference rohitukine and that produced by the plant. The rohitukine content in the mycelial samples ranged from 192.78\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg to 359.55\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0100\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921 of dry weight of and in broth it ranged from 14.10 to 71.90\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0100\xc2\xa0ml\xe2\x88\x921. In all the fungal cultures, the production declined from first to fourth sub-culture. Studies are underway to unravel the mechanism by which the fungi produce the host metabolite in culture.'

Abstract: 'AbstractCentral Sahara rock shelters offer an early and middle Holocene environmental reconstruction. This paper summarises palynological research carried out within a multidisciplinary archaeological research project on the Wadi Teshuinat area (Tadrart Acacus Mts., in south-western Fezzan, Libya). The sites were occupied by hunter-gatherer and pastoralist cultures. On-site pollen data, treated as a single \xe2\x80\x98regional site\xe2\x80\x99, showed that different pollen stratigraphies and flora characterised the past phases. Plant macro-remains also helped to understand local plant exploitation and landscape evolution. Pollen spectra showed the following climate oscillations: wet and cool (approx. 8800\xe2\x80\x938250\xc2\xa0cal.\xc2\xa0BC), dry and warm (approx. 7920\xe2\x80\x937520\xc2\xa0cal.\xc2\xa0BC), wet (approx. 7550\xe2\x80\x937200\xc2\xa0cal.\xc2\xa0BC), dry (approx. 6340\xe2\x80\x936210\xc2\xa0cal.\xc2\xa0BC\xe2\x80\x94geoarchaeological evidence), wet and warm (approx. 6250\xe2\x80\x934300\xc2\xa0cal.\xc2\xa0BC, including a wetter and warmer phase at approx. 5500\xe2\x80\x934600\xc2\xa0cal.\xc2\xa0BC); dry and warm (approx. 4250\xe2\x80\x932900\xc2\xa0cal.\xc2\xa0BC); drier and warm (approx. 2900\xe2\x80\x931600\xc2\xa0cal.\xc2\xa0BC, up to the present). Since the early Holocene, both climatic and anthropic factors have played an important and strictly interconnected role in transforming the environment. Thus, while subsistence strategies were adjusting to climatic and environmental changes, the plant landscape was also being slowly and continuously shaped by humans.'

Title: 'ArticlesA decision support system for optimal design of hydroelectric projects in Uttara Kannada'
Author: 'T.V.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0973082608602732
Abstract: "The first hydropower plant in Karnataka state, India, was set up at Shivanasamudram in 1902. Gradually, the capacities of hydropower plants became very large due to increased electricity demand. Large-scale hydroelectric plants now contribute significantly to meeting the state's and the nation's demand for electricity. Most of Karnataka's hydroelectric plants are located in Uttara Kannada district. Construction of large reservoirs is restricted due to environmental constraints and necessitates the development of ecologically sound alternatives to cater for the needs of the region. The planning of water resources depends on type and size of projects, the ecological factors involved, etc. Emphasis is placed on presenting an overview of water resources through meteorological, hydrological, ecological and economic data. Economic data includes all costs and benefits, specifically hitherto underestimated, environmental social costs and benefits. This study was carried out in Bedthi and Aghnashini rivers in Uttara Kannada district of the Western Ghats region, Karnataka state, India. An estimated 720 and 510 million kWh of electricity can be generated in Bedthi and Aghnashini river basins if all the streams are harnessed. Focusing on land submergence impact, a model is proposed to minimize submergence and maximize net energy in a region, with seasonal power generation, reservoir storage capacity (so as to meet the region's demand during all seasons) and installed generation capacity as the decision variables. Net energy analyses incorporating biomass energy lost in submergence show that maximization in net energy at a site is possible, if the hydroelectric generation capacity is adjusted according to the seasonal variations in the river's water discharge. A decision support system (DSS) used in water resource planning for electricity generation is discussed in this paper."

Title: 'Application of native yeast from Garcinia (Garcinia xanthochumus) for the preparation of fermented beverage: Changes in biochemical and antioxidant properties'
Author: 'Amit Kumar'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212429213000850
Abstract: 'AbstractGarcinia beverage was prepared by fermentation of ameliorated must of Garcinia xanthochymus using native yeast isolated from naturally fermented Garcinia must. The native yeast was identified as Hanseniaspora sp. (Accession no. U826968) based on biochemical and molecular tests. Low alcoholic Garcinia beverages were prepared at four different must concentration (5%, 10%, 20%, and 30% w/v). Fermentation using Hansiniaspora sp. was carried out for 28 days and the fermented must were analyzed for changes in physical, biochemical and sensory characteristics. The present study mainly focused on changes in organic acid profile during fermentation, in particular, degradation of oxalic acid and antioxidant properties of the fermented beverage. Results showed utilization of citric acid and 100% degradation of oxalic acid (antinutritional factor) with the synthesis of aspartic acid. Antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity) was significantly higher in beverage with higher must concentration along with dose dependency. Upon sensory analysis, the beverage prepared with 5% and 10% must were the only acceptable ones.'

Title: 'Satellite Earth observation data to identify anthropogenic pressures in selected protected areas'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Parks experience stress from human pressures, which require mapping and monitoring.\xe2\x80\xa2Earth observation (EO) data can monitor changes in state resulting from pressure over time.\xe2\x80\xa2Impact on landscapes, habitats and species communities can be related to pressure.\xe2\x80\xa2EO data useful for monitoring pressure and changes in state are listed for parks in six countries.\xe2\x80\xa2The approach is illustrated in two contexts in Italy and The Netherlands.AbstractProtected areas are experiencing increased levels of human pressure. To enable appropriate conservation action, it is critical to map and monitor changes in the type and extent of land cover/use and habitat classes, which can be related to human pressures over time. Satellite Earth observation (EO) data and techniques offer the opportunity to detect such changes. Yet association with field information and expert interpretation by ecologists is required to interpret, qualify and link these changes to human pressure. There is thus an urgent need to harmonize the technical background of experts in the field of EO data analysis with the terminology of ecologists, protected area management authorities and policy makers in order to provide meaningful, context-specific value-added EO products. This paper builds on the DPSIR framework, providing a terminology to relate the concepts of state, pressures, and drivers with the application of EO analysis. The type of pressure can be inferred through the detection of changes in state (i.e. changes in land cover and/or habitat type and/or condition). Four broad categories of changes in state are identified, i.e. land cover/habitat conversion, land cover/habitat modification, habitat fragmentation and changes in landscape connectivity, and changes in plant community structure. These categories of change in state can be mapped through EO analyses, with the goal of using expert judgement to relate changes in state to causal direct anthropogenic pressures. Drawing on expert knowledge, a set of protected areas located in diverse socio-ecological contexts and subject to a variety of pressures are analysed to (a) link the four categories of changes in state of land cover/habitats to the drivers (anthropogenic pressure), as relevant to specific target land cover and habitat classes; (b) identify (for pressure mapping) the most appropriate spatial and temporal EO data sources as well as interpretations from ecologists and field data useful in connection with EO data analysis. We provide detailed examples for two protected areas, demonstrating the use of EO data for detection of land cover/habitat change, coupled with expert interpretation to relate such change to specific anthropogenic pressures. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations and feasibility of using EO data and techniques to identify anthropogenic pressures, suggesting additional research efforts required in this direction.'

Title: "Moisture and nutrients determine the distribution and richness of India's large herbivore species assemblage"
Author: 'Farshid S.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179111001046
Abstract: "AbstractThe goal of this study was to test whether body-mass based foraging principles, guided by plant available moisture (PAM) and plant available nutrients (PAN), could explain large mammalian herbivore species distribution and richness in India. We tested (1) whether the occurrence of larger-bodied herbivore species increases with PAM, but is independent of PAN, (2) whether the occurrence of smaller-bodied herbivore species decreases with PAM, but increases with PAN, and (3) whether herbivore species richness is highest in areas with intermediate PAM and high PAN. We analyzed the distribution and richness of the 16 large (>10\xc2\xa0kg) herbivore species found in sub-Himalayan mainland India. Since the distributions of large herbivores in India have been altered by historic human activity, we only used India's largest 76 protected areas as data points, with respect to PAM (log10(rainfall/potential evapotranspiration)), PAN (soil cation exchange capacity), elevation, tree cover, and fire frequency. Using regression and null models to analyze the data, we found positive relations between PAM and the occurrences of the larger-bodied species (elephant and gaur), and negative relations between PAM and the occurrences of smaller-bodied species (chinkara, four-horned antelope and blackbuck). We also found positive relations between the occurrence of the smaller-bodied species and PAN. Large herbivore species richness in India is highest in Kanha and Indravati, areas with high PAN and intermediate PAM. We found that elevation, tree cover and fire frequency were insignificant predictors of herbivore species richness, although elevation and tree cover explained the distribution of a few species. Based on our null model analyses results, we conclude that moisture and soil nutrients are important in determining large herbivore species distribution and richness in sub-Himalayan India.ZusammenfassungDas Ziel dieser Untersuchung war es zu pr\xc3\xbcfen, ob K\xc3\xb6rpergewicht-basierte Prinzipien der Futtersuche, gesteuert durch pflanzenverf\xc3\xbcgbare Feuchtigkeit (PAM) und N\xc3\xa4hrstoffverf\xc3\xbcgbarkeit (PAN), die Verbreitung und den Artenreichtum herbivorer Gro\xc3\x9fs\xc3\xa4uger in Indien erkl\xc3\xa4ren k\xc3\xb6nnen.

Wir analysierten die Verbreitung und den Artenreichtum der 16 gro\xc3\x9fen (>10\xc2\xa0kg) Herbivorenarten, die in der Sub-Himalaya-Region Indiens gefunden werden. Da die Verbreitung der gro\xc3\x9fen Herbivoren in Indien anthropogen beeinflusst wurde, nutzten wir nur die 76 gr\xc3\xb6\xc3\x9ften Schutzgebiete Indiens als Datenpunkte und ber\xc3\xbccksichtigten PAM (log (Niederschlag/potentielle Evapotranspiration)), PAN (Kationenaustauschkapazit\xc3\xa4t des Bodens), H\xc3\xb6he, Kronenbedeckung, und die H\xc3\xa4ufigkeit von Feuern.

Abstract: 'AbstractBiodiversity is the feedstock for the biotechnology industry. Hence, the conservation, enhancement and sustainable and equitable use of biodiversity should be accorded high priority in all national environment protection programmes. Lichens serve as useful indicators of environmental health. Similarly, several blue green algae help to sequester salt from water. There is need for the more widespread use of such biomonitoring and bioremediation agents. Bioprospecting research designed to identify novel metabolites must be rooted in the principle of equity in sharing benefits with the holders of traditional knowledge. There is need for greater vigil against alien invasive species, since with growing world trade in food grains and other agricultural commodities, there is an increasing possibility of introducing new pests, weeds and harmful micro-organisms. Finally, biological scientists should place emphasis on their ethical responsibility for the consequences of their research, since otherwise bioterrorism could become a major threat to human security.'

Abstract: 'AbstractMetropolitan cities in India are emerging as major economic hubs with an unprecedented land use changes and decline of environmental resources. Globalisation and consequent relaxations of Indian markets to global players has given impetus to rapid urbanisation process. Urbanisation being irreversible and rapid coupled with fast growth of population during the last century, contributed to serious ecological and environmental consequences. This necessitates monitoring and advance visualisation of spatial patterns of landscape dynamics for evolving appropriate management strategies towards sustainable development approaches. This study visualises the growth of Indian mega cities Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai and Coimbatore, through Cellular Automata Markov model considering the influence of agent(s) of urban growth through soft computing techniques. CA Markov model is considered to be one of most effective algorithm to visualise the growth of urban spatial structures. Prediction of growth using agent based modelling considering the spatial patterns of urbanisation during the past four decades has provided insights to the urban dynamics. The industrial, infrastructural, socio-economic factors significantly influence the urban growth compared to the biophysical factors. Visualisation of urban growth suggest agents driven growth in the cities and its surroundings with large land use transformations in urban corridors and upcoming Industrial and ear marked developmental zones. Integrating local agents of urban growth help in identifying specific regions of intense growth, likely challenges and provide opportunities for evolving appropriate management strategies towards sustainable cities during the 21st century.'

Abstract: 'Different isolates of a foliar endophytic species of Phyllosticta were isolated from different tropical tree species in India to examine genetic variation among the isolates. Internal transcribed spacer-restriction fragment length polymorphism (ITS-RFLP) analysis did not detect any variation among the isolates, suggesting that they all belong to the same species. Sequence data of the ITS region of ribosomal DNA (ITS1 and ITS2, including 5.8S rDNA) supported the identity of the present fungal isolates as P. capitalensis. These results show that P. capitalensis (teleomorph Guignardia endophyllicola?) is an ubiquitous foliar endophyte that can infect tree hosts from different families and habitats.'

Presence of cry1, cry2, cry3, 7, 8, cry4, cry5, 12, 14, 21, cry11, cry13 and cyt1 genes from Bt strains isolated from various regions of India was determined by PCR amplification. A varied distribution of cry genes and their profiles was found in four soil types. The cry1 gene was the most abundant in the isolates from four soil types and geographical regions. A higher degree of cry gene diversity was observed in isolates from alluvial soil. Rarefaction analysis indicated that more cry genes could be found from various soil types. Distribution of cry genes in semi arid, subtropical humid and tropical dry regions was varied but the degree of cry gene diversity determined by rarefaction analysis was similar. No major difference in distribution and diversity of cry genes was found in agricultural and non-agricultural samples except the absence of cry3 and cry13 genes in isolates of non-agricultural samples.

Abstract: 'AbstractA large-scale perspective is provided upon the spatial distribution of river flow regimes across the Nepalese Himalaya by classifying long-term average monthly runoff data for 28 river basins. The classification methodology is shown to be a useful tool for identifying underlying spatial structure in flow regime shape (timing of peak) and magnitude (low, intermediate and high) in an extreme physical environment where hydrological patterns are complex and poorly known. Low, marked August peak regimes occur across far-western Nepal but also in some eastern basins, which have a short summer monsoon and snow- and ice-melt. Low, July\xe2\x80\x93August peak regimes are found in the central to eastern High Mountains and High Himalaya and the eastern Middle Mountains where the summer monsoon arrives earliest, meltwaters contribute but topography limits precipitation amount. Low\xe2\x80\x93intermediate, August\xe2\x80\x93September peak regimes dominate the central Middle Mountains due to an extended summer monsoon and greater groundwater contributions. Intermediate\xe2\x80\x93high magnitude regimes occur along the Middle Mountains\xe2\x80\x93High Mountains boundary with July\xe2\x80\x93August peaks in western\xe2\x80\x93central areas and marked August peaks at higher elevations in eastern\xe2\x80\x93central and eastern Nepal, reflecting differences in summer monsoon penetration.

Abstract: 'AbstractCoastal erosion is a natural phenomenon affecting a large number of coastal areas. The coastal zone is an area with immense geological, geomorphological and ecological interest. Monitoring and mitigation of shoreline erosion along populated coastal areas is an important task and remains a difficult goal to achieve. The coast of Karnataka state extends from Talapadi in south to Sadashivgad in north covering a distance of about 280\xc2\xa0km. In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the shoreline transformation along the Karnataka coast. Fair weather satellite images of LANDSAT from 1991 to 2014 with an interval of eight years were used to delineate the shoreline. A Linear Regression Rate-of-change (LRR) and an End Point Rate (EPR) statistic was carried out using Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) computer software of United States Geological Survey (USGS). Highest EPR of about 15.96 m (1991-2014) was noticed in the Ankola taluk, whereas highest LRR was about 15.5 m in Karwar, both indicating accretion. Highest erosion was noticed in Honnavar with an LRR of 19.59 m respectively and EPR of 19.95 m.'

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\x98Watershed services\xe2\x80\x99 provided by forest ecosystems are receiving increasing attention in the research and policy arena. Changes in forest cover in tropical regions take many different forms and result in multi-dimensional changes in watershed processes: soil erosion rates, peak and low-flow levels, groundwater recharge rates, and water quality. These changes are in turn mediated by the socio-technical context to create a variety of context-specific human impacts, which constitute watershed \xe2\x80\x98services\xe2\x80\x99 (or \xe2\x80\x98dis-services\xe2\x80\x99). Over the past decade, understanding of the biophysical linkage has generally become nuanced. But large gaps remain in regions like south Asia and Africa and on the question of how different types of forest transitions affect low flows, and the socio-hydrological links are inadequately studied. Economic valuation studies are still plagued with conceptual errors, oversimplified biophysical models, lack of social and technological context, and focus on lump-sum numbers. Greater integration of concepts, methods and latest results, and attention to context-specificity, are required for generating policy-relevant insights.'

Abstract: 'AbstractGradient modelling of a steep ecocline in South India has highlighted a suite of landscape units, which appear to be entirely ordained by a simple water balance index. This univariate climofunction is reflected in vegetation, landform, weathering and soil patterns.

The present study aims at effective monitoring of forest fires over the Indian region using Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime satellite data and to evaluate the active fire detection capabilities of the sensor. Nightly DMSP-OLS fire products were generated from February to May 2005 (peak fire season) and analyzed to study the occurrence and behavior of fires over different forest physiognomies in Indian region. Fire products generated from DMSP-OLS were validated with ground observations of fire records from state forest departments to evaluate the accuracy of fire products. Further, inter-comparison of the DMSP-OLS derived fire products with contemporary fire products from Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (both daytime and nighttime products) in addition to fires and burnt areas derived from Indian Remote sensing Satellite (IRS-P6) Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) data has been done to analyze spatial agreement of fire locations given by the above sensors.Results from the DMSP-OLS fire products (derived from February to May 2005) over Indian region showed high forest fires in southern dry deciduous forests during February\xe2\x80\x93March; central Indian dry and mixed deciduous forests during March\xe2\x80\x93April; northeastern tropical forests during February\xe2\x80\x93April and northern pine forests during May. Spatial pattern in fires showed a typical seasonal shift in fire activity from the southern dry deciduous forests to the northern pine forests and temperate forests as the fire season progressed. Statistical evaluation of DMSP-OLS fire products with ground observations showed an over all accuracy of 98%. Comparison of DMSP-OLS derived fires with consecutive MODIS and AWiFS derived fires for individual days indicated that 69% of the fires continued from current day (DMSP-OLS pass around \xe2\x88\xbc\xc2\xa07\xc2\xa0pm to \xe2\x88\xbc\xc2\xa010\xc2\xa0pm local time) to the next day (MODIS and AWiFS pass \xe2\x88\xbc\xc2\xa010:30\xc2\xa0am local time). Comparison of DMSP-OLS derived fires with burnt areas estimated from AWiFS showed that 98% of DMSP-OLS derived fires on the current day fell within the burnt area of AWiFS on subsequent day. Since the worst forest fires are those that extend from the current to the consecutive days, DMSP-OLS derived fires provide a valuable augmentation to the fires derived from other sensors operating in daytime.'

Title: 'Wiesneria triandra (Dalzell) Micheli (Alismataceae): a rare and unusual south Indian endemic'
Author: 'Martin'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304377096010650
Abstract: 'AbstractWiesneria triandra (Dalzell) Micheli is a phylogenetically isolated, local, endemic species of southwest India. It is annual and very sporadic in occurrence but when it is found it is often locally abundant. The inflorescences have mostly unisexual flowers with females borne below the males. Experiments have shown W. triandra to be amphimictic and self-compatible. Pollination can take place without a biotic vector. It is likely that it is highly inbreeding in spite of having unisexual flowers. The nutlets are very hard and have lateral gas-filled invaginations which provide short-lived buoyancy. The seeds have a dormancy induced by the testa (or perhaps the pericarp) which can be broken by mechanical, physical and chemical scarification. Dormancy is an important survival strategy, preventing seeds from germinating after showers during the dry season. The nutlets are dispersed over short distances by water. A mechanism for dispersal over long distances is unknown; the nutlets are digested by Anas platyrhynchos L. and are unlikely to be carried externally on water birds because they are hydrophobic, globose and rather heavy. Germination is typical for the family (with \xe2\x80\x98Haarkranz\xe2\x80\x99 and suppressed primary root) except that the hypocotyl emerges through a clearly demarcated cap. Plants growing in and out of water show a marked heteroblastic leaf development, the \xe2\x80\x98juvenile\xe2\x80\x99 leaves are strap-shaped while the \xe2\x80\x98mature\xe2\x80\x99 leaves are clearly differentiated into petiole and blade. In 1993 we were able to study two populations. Although the two populations were about 160 km apart, no convincing inter- or intra-population variation was detected using morphological characters and eight isozyme systems. Today, W. triandra is found only in habitats modified or maintained by man; the original habitat is discussed. Although rare it is not threatened with immediate extinction but is very susceptible to change in land usage and should be placed in the \xe2\x80\x98vulnerable\xe2\x80\x99 category.'

Recent mathematical models that allow estimation of diversification rates across time from reconstructed phylogenies have enabled us to make inferences on how biodiversity copes with environmental change. Here, we explore patterns of temporal diversification in Uropeltidae, a diverse fossorial snake family. We generate a time-calibrated phylogenetic hypothesis for Uropeltidae and show a significant correlation between diversification rate and paleotemperature during the Cenozoic. We show that the temporal diversification pattern of this group is punctuated by one rate shift event with a decrease in diversification and turnover rate between ca. 11\xc2\xa0Ma to present, but there is no strong support for mass extinction events. The analysis indicates higher turnover during periods of drastic climatic fluctuations and reduced diversification rates associated with contraction and fragmentation of forest habitats during the late Miocene. Our study highlights the influence of environmental fluctuations on diversification rates in fossorial taxa such as uropeltids, and raises conservation concerns related to present rate of climate change.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (109KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractLack of knowledge on forest structure, composition, and magnitude of human impact on various components of the ecosystem remain a major limitation for the development of appropriate participatory management programmes for conservation and sustainable utilisation of forests in Nepal. This study provides information on state of the resource base and effects of site characteristics and human activities on density, diversity and regeneration in Sal (Shorea robusta Gaertn.f.) and Mixed Broadleaved (MBL) forests in the central, lower Mid-Hills of Nepal. For trees with diameter \xe2\xa9\xbe10\xc2\xa0cm the results are based on 72 square (20\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa020\xc2\xa0m) plots; for shrubs and herbs the material included 144 plots, nested within the 72 larger plots. Apart from vegetation data the material included information on human impacts, such as tree cutting, livestock grazing and lopping. The proportion of trees felled in Sal forest was observed to be up to 41%. The pressure on the vegetation also affected the regeneration of trees, shrubs and herbs. The density and basal area were moderate for all vegetation types, whereas the species diversity was higher than previously observed in other forests of Nepal. Among the species used by the ethnic group living in the study area, the Chepangs, only half (49.7%) were represented within the plots and the regeneration of such species was poor. Effects of altitude, aspect, grazing, crown cover and other factors on basal area and density of different vegetation strata was examined using general linear models. The results indicated significant human impact on the forest vegetation, both with respect to species diversity, density, distribution, and composition. Reduction of the densities of key livelihood species will affect the social and economic welfare of local people. Thus an improvement of forest management is urgent, because the forests need immediate recovery.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Density, diversity, frequency, basal area, coverage and utilisation effects were studied in two types of forests. \xe2\x96\xba Indicated significant human impact on species diversity, density, distribution, composition and regeneration. \xe2\x96\xba Reduction of the densities of key livelihood species affects the social and economic welfare of local people.'

Abstract: 'AbstractMalaria is a major public health problem in India and one which contributes significantly to the overall malaria burden in Southeast Asia. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Program of India reported \xe2\x88\xbc1.6 million cases and \xe2\x88\xbc1100 malaria deaths in 2009. Some experts argue that this is a serious underestimation and that the actual number of malaria cases per year is likely between 9 and 50 times greater, with an approximate 13-fold underestimation of malaria-related mortality. The difficulty in making these estimations is further exacerbated by (i) highly variable malaria eco-epidemiological profiles, (ii) the transmission and overlap of multiple Plasmodium species and Anopheles vectors, (iii) increasing antimalarial drug resistance and insecticide resistance, and (iv) the impact of climate change on each of these variables. Simply stated, the burden of malaria in India is complex. Here we describe plans for a Center for the Study of Complex Malaria in India (CSCMi), one of ten International Centers of Excellence in Malaria Research (ICEMRs) located in malarious regions of the world recently funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health. The CSCMi is a close partnership between Indian and United States scientists, and aims to address major gaps in our understanding of the complexity of malaria in India, including changing patterns of epidemiology, vector biology and control, drug resistance, and parasite genomics. We hope that such a multidisciplinary approach that integrates clinical and field studies with laboratory, molecular, and genomic methods will provide a powerful combination for malaria control and prevention in India.Graphical abstractWe present plans for a Center for the Study of Complex Malaria in India (CSCMi), a partnership between Indian and United States scientists, made possible through funding from the National Institutes of Health and their commitment to establish International Centers of Excellence in Malaria Research.

Title: 'Endophytic fungi from Miquelia dentata Bedd., produce the anti-cancer alkaloid, camptothecine'
Author: 'Singh'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944711312004813
Abstract: 'AbstractCamptothecine (Campothecin, CPT), a quinoline alkaloid, is a potent inhibitor of eukaryotic topoisomerase I. Several semi-synthetic derivatives of CPT are in clinical use against ovarian, small lung and refractory ovarian cancers. While CPT is produced by several plant species belonging to the Asterid clade, in recent years, efforts have been made to isolate endophytic fungi from some of these plants as possible alternative sources of CPT. In this study we report the isolation of three endophytic fungi from fruit and seed regions of Miquelia dentata (Icacinaceae), that produce CPT, 9-methoxy CPT (9-MeO-CPT) and 10-hydroxy CPT (10-OH-CPT). All the three fungi identified as, Fomitopsis sp. P. Karst (MTCC 10177), Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissl (MTCC 5477) and Phomposis sp. (Sacc.) produced CPT, 9-MeO-CPT and 10-OH-CPT in mycelial mats in shake flasks containing potato dextrose broth. Methanolic and ethyl acetate extracts of these fungal species were cytotoxic to colon and breast cancer cell lines. We discuss these results in the context of the recent interest in endophytic fungi as possible alternative sources of plant secondary metabolites.'

Title: 'Overcoming ecological barriers to tropical lower montane forest succession on anthropogenic grasslands: Synthesis and future prospects'
Author: 'A.M.T.A.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112714001893
Abstract: 'AbstractUnderstanding the ecological mechanisms that constrain forest succession in tropical degraded anthropogenic grasslands is a prerequisite for the design of techniques for restoring biodiversity and ecosystem processes. In this context, succession on post-agricultural lands may be arrested by a variety of site-specific biotic and abiotic factors. Here we synthesise our research on the effects of five biotic factors (seed dispersal, development of a soil seed bank, seedling emergence, herbivory, competition) and five abiotic factors (fire, microclimatic conditions, soil nutrients, water availability, disturbance) as constraints to forest succession on degraded anthropogenic grasslands in a tropical lower montane forest landscape in Sri Lanka. The aim of this research was to deduce ecologically and socially acceptable restoration techniques to accelerate forest recovery. Colonisation of grasslands by trees is constrained by limited seed dispersal from adjacent remnant forest patches and their incorporation into grassland soil seed banks. For the few tree seeds that are dispersed into grasslands, a combination of vertebrate herbivory and annual dry season fires reduces the likelihood that they emerge as seedlings. Removal of the grass canopy by clipping or tilling increases the emergence of woody plant seedlings close to the boundaries of forest patches, but has no effect beyond 20\xc2\xa0m into the established grassland. Our research shows that isolation of seedling root systems from those of competing grasses increases the growth and survival of tree seedlings transplanted directly into grassland swards, while above-ground competition and exclusion of vertebrate herbivores has no effects on seedling growth and survival. These experiments identified that the early-successional species Macaranga indica Wight and Symplocos cochinchinensis (Lour.) S. Moore are potential candidates for use in reforestation programmes on abandoned grasslands. We propose a strategy for a model forest restoration programme based on the creation of vegetation islands using early-successional native tree species, the application of a tilling treatment around remnant forest patches, creation of fire breaks around vegetation islands, and the protection of isolated individual trees and tree patches within established grasslands. We highlight the importance of further research on the ecology and biology of seed dispersers and seed predators, and expansion of knowledge on the regeneration traits of native tree species, for future refinements of this restoration strategy.'

Title: 'Effects of phytopathogens on plant community dynamics: A review'
Author: 'Tao'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1872203215000475
Abstract: "AbstractThe impacts of phytopathogens on agricultural systems, disease controls and economic losses caused by the pathogens are internationally important research subjects. Recently, increasing evidence has shown that phytopathogens play a critical role in mediating competitions among their host plant species. According to Chesson's coexistence framework, niche differences (i.e., species differences in resource use, host-specific pathogen loads, and other ecosystem processes) are more associated with intra-specific limitation than with inter-specific limitation. However, fitness differences (i.e., variations in competition abilities among plant species) can determine the dominance of plant species. An increase in niche differences tends to promote the coexistence of plant species, whereas an increase in fitness differences tends to exclude competing species. In this review, two types of pathogen mechanisms that could affect plant communities are discussed based on the coexistence framework. Type I is the density-dependent pathogen mechanism, in which disease occurrence in a community is related to the density of host species. In this mechanism, disease transmission increases niche differences as a host species becomes common, and/or reduces niche differences as a host species becomes rare. Type II is the density-independent pathogen mechanism, in which disease transmission does not depend on host plant density. This mechanism mainly focuses on fitness differences. When competitively dominant host plants are more susceptible to pathogens, pathogens can reduce fitness differences among species and thereby improve plant diversity. Alternatively, if the competing species are more resistant than other species to pathogens, fitness differences are prone to be increased.The Janzen\xe2\x80\x93Connell effect (JC effect) and plant\xe2\x80\x93soil feedback theory are characterized by Type I phytopathogen mechanism and are discussed here in details. The JC hypothesis has been mostly applied to forest ecosystems, whereas the plant\xe2\x80\x93soil feedback theory has been applied more widely in several ecosystems. The JC hypothesis assumes that seeds/seedlings around the mother plant are most susceptible to host-specific pathogens. Since seed/seedling mortality caused by pathogens is related to plant density, the JC effect is an example of negative density dependence. The plant\xe2\x80\x93soil feedback theory illustrates the interactions between plants and soil. Plants can alter soil properties through the input of organic matter and chemicals, and provide habitats and nutrients for soil organisms, which in turn can affect plant performance. This feedback can be either negative or positive, depending on whether it leads to a net reduction or an enhancement of plant growth when comparing the plant species cultured in soil conditioned by the plant to that in mixed soil.This review summarizes phytopathogen effects on plant diversity, plant invasion, community succession, and addresses some future research challenges. Several research goals are highlighted; for instance, studies of pathogens with multiple hosts and host plants with multiple pathogens are necessary for a better understanding of the role of phytopathogens in plant community dynamics. Research on the interactions of plant pathogen with soil legacy (priority) could provide new insights into the influences of phytopathogen on plant communities during climate change. In addition, a combination of theoretical modeling and field studies would be an effective way to examine the function of phytopathogens in plant community dynamics."

Title: 'Using district-level occurrences in MaxEnt for predicting the invasion potential of an exotic insect pest in India'
Author: 'Sunil'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2First study to demonstrate MaxEnt\xe2\x80\x99s use for district-level occurrences.\xe2\x80\xa2All previous studies using MaxEnt used precise coordinates of species occurrences.\xe2\x80\xa2Predicted invasion potential of a cotton pest at national level in India.\xe2\x80\xa2Risk map can be used for selecting monitoring and surveillance sites and planning.\xe2\x80\xa2Approach can be used in other countries that lack precise coordinates of pests.AbstractInsect pests are a major threat to agricultural biosecurity across the world, causing substantial economic losses. Majority of the species distribution modeling studies use precise coordinates (latitude/longitude) of species occurrences in MaxEnt (or maximum entropy model). However, lack of precise coordinates of insect pest occurrences at national/regional level is a common problem for many countries including India. This is because of the limited resources, lack of nationally coordinated surveys, and growers/farmers\xe2\x80\x99 privacy issues; district-level occurrences are commonly available (e.g., National Agricultural Pest Information System or NAPIS in the United States; http://pest.ceris.purdue.edu/). We demonstrated the use of MaxEnt to generate a preliminary, district-level map of the potential risk of invasion by an exotic cotton mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis (Tinsley) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) in India. District-level occurrence data were integrated with bioclimatic variables (values averaged within districts) using MaxEnt. The MaxEnt model performed better than random with an average test AUC value of 0.86 (\xc2\xb10.05). Our model predictions matched closely with the documented occurrence of P. solenopsis in all nine cotton growing states, and also predicted suitable habitats in other districts across India. The greatest threat of P. solenopsis infestations were predicted in most districts of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, southwestern Punjab, northwestern Rajasthan, and western Haryana. Precipitation of coldest quarter, temperature annual range, and precipitation seasonality were the strongest predictors associated with P. solenopsis distribution. Precipitation of coldest quarter was negatively correlated with P. solenopsis occurrence. Mapping the potential distribution of invasive species is an iterative process, and our study is the first attempt to model national-level risk assessment of P. solenopsis in India. Our results can be used for selecting monitoring and surveillance sites and designing local, regional and national-level integrated pest management policies for cotton and other cultivated crops in India. The maps of potential pest distributions are urgently needed by agriculture managers and policymakers. Our approach can be used in other countries that lack precise coordinates of insect pest occurrences and generate a preliminary map of potential risk because it may be too late to wait for the precise coordinates of pest occurrences to generate a perfect map.'

Author: 'Shreyans K.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960894X14004880
Abstract: 'AbstractCamptothecin (CPT, 1) is a potent anticancer natural product which led to the discovery of two clinically used anticancer drugs topotecan and irinotecan. These two drugs are semisynthetic analogs of CPT, and thus the commercial production of CPT as a raw material from various plant sources and tissue culture methods is highly demanding. In the present study, the Dysoxylum binectariferum bark, was identified as an alternative source of CPT, through bioassay-guided isolation. The barks showed presence of CPT (1) and its 9-methoxy analog 2, whereas CPT alkaloids were not present in seeds and leaves. This is the first report on isolation of CPT alkaloids from Meliaceae family. An efficient chromatography-free protocol for enrichment and isolation of CPT from D. binectariferum has been established, which was able to enrich CPT up to 21% in the crude extract. The LCMS (MRM)-based quantification method revealed the presence of 0.105% of CPT in dry barks of D. binectariferum. The discovery of CPT from D. binectariferum bark will certainly create a global interest in cultivation of this plant as a new crop for commercial production of CPT. Isolation of anticancer drug CPT from this plant, indicates that along with rohitukine, CPT and 9-methoxy CPT also contributes significantly to the cytotoxicity of D. binectariferum.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image'

Author: 'Lidita'

Abstract: 'AbstractMicrobial community structure was analyzed from tropical monsoon influenced Mandovi-Zuari (Ma-Zu) estuarine sediment by means of Next Gen Sequencing (NGS) approach using Ion Torrent PGM\xe2\x84\xa2. The sequencing generated 80,282 raw sequence reads. Barcoding with Ion Tags allowed multiplex analysis of microbial community and helped in identifying shifts in microbial community structure. Analysis of sequence data revealed that sediment at both the stations in the Mandovi estuary was dominated by Archaeal group, Euryarchaeota (53.1% and 64.01%). Among Euryarchaeota, Methanomicrobia was dominant. Methanococci was present only at the mouth and Methanopyri was detected at the mid-estuarine station. Whereas, both the stations of Zuari estuary were dominated by Bacteria, Proteobacteria, mainly Gammaproteobacteria (97.67% and 54.41%). A clear influence of mangrove ecosystem on the bacterial diversity was evident in the Zuari estuary. These results suggest that the two estuaries have a very distinct microbial community structure. Characterization of microbial communities in this study area using NGS for the first time points out that even within geographically close habitats, the microbial population structure is significantly influenced by localized interactions. The signatures obtained from sediments can thus be used to reconstruct habitat characteristics and serve as biomarkers. Future studies should focus on the functional gene profiling of different microbial communities and the influence of seasons and tide in such monsoon influenced estuaries.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We model the interaction between habitat loss and climate.\xe2\x80\xa2We quantify the implications for biodiversity loss and conservation priorities.\xe2\x80\xa2We show that the interaction increases impacts on birds and mammals by up to 43%.\xe2\x80\xa2The ranking of biodiversity hotspots by threat depends critically on the interaction.AbstractClimate change and land-cover change will have major impacts on biodiversity persistence worldwide. These two stressors are likely to interact, but how climate change will mediate the effects of land-cover change remains poorly understood. Here we use an empirically-derived model of the interaction between habitat loss and climate to predict the implications of this for biodiversity loss and conservation priorities at a global scale. Risk analysis was used to estimate the risk of biodiversity loss due to alternative future land-cover change scenarios and to quantify how climate change mediates this risk. We demonstrate that the interaction of climate change with land-cover change could increase the impact of land-cover change on birds and mammals by up to 43% and 24% respectively and alter the spatial distribution of threats. Additionally, we show that the ranking of global biodiversity hotspots by threat depends critically on the interaction between climate change and habitat loss. Our study suggests that the investment of conservation resources will likely change once the interaction between climate change and land-cover change is taken into account. We argue that global conservation efforts must take this into account if we are to develop cost-effective conservation policies and strategies under global change.'

Title: 'Rapid monitoring of species abundance for biodiversity conservation: Consistency and reliability of the MacKinnon lists technique'
Author: 'Ross'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320710005161
Abstract: 'AbstractEffective monitoring of biodiversity for conservation requires information on spatial and temporal variation in species\xe2\x80\x99 abundances. As conservation resources are limited, monitoring methods are required that enable rapid and cost effective data collection. There are many traditional methods of estimating absolute abundance, such as territory mapping and distance sampling. However, these typically require more time, expertise and finances than are available across much of the globe. This is especially so in the tropics, where high species richness, low densities of many species and structurally complex environments also make monitoring particularly challenging. The MacKinnon lists technique is a rapid assessment methodology designed for use in species rich environments. This method is typically used to estimate species richness, but it has also been suggested that it can generate consistent abundance indices, even when observer experience and environmental conditions vary. If this suggestion is correct, the MacKinnon lists method could be used to assess spatial or temporal changes in abundance using diverse survey data. Here, we provide the first detailed assessment of intra- and inter-observer consistency of the Mackinnon List method in generating species abundance indices that could be useful for conservation monitoring purposes. As a case study, we use one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most diverse avifaunas, that of the forested Bolivian Andes. We show that MacKinnon lists can provide species abundance indices that are consistent between observers of markedly different experience of the focal avifauna (zero to six years), and between assessments carried out in different stages of the breeding season, between which detectability of individuals differed significantly. We believe this is the first time that a biodiversity monitoring method has been demonstrated to produce consistent abundance indices for a highly diverse avian tropical assemblage. We also suggest that the MacKinnon lists methodology has the potential to be a very useful conservation monitoring tool for many taxa in species rich environments, such as the tropics.'

Commensurate with the present day aversion to the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides; there is an overt emphasis on use of organic inputs and microbial inoculants which play an important role in sustainable agriculture. Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are an important group of microbial inoculants that have been studied extensively for their ability to promote plant growth and improve productivity. PGPR operate through either direct or indirect mechanisms or a combination of both, and there by minimize the environmental impact of chemical intensive farming practices. Direct mechanisms of plant growth promotion include the secretion of plant growth promoting metabolites like indole acetic acid (IAA), cytokinins, gibberellins, etc., and facilitating the uptake of essential nutrients (N, P, Fe, Zn, etc.) from the atmospheric air and soil. Indirect promotion of the plant growth occurs when PGPR lessen or prevent the deleterious effect of phytopathogenic organisms by the production of antibiotics, siderophores, hydrogen cyanide (HCN), etc. Well known PGPRs that have reached the stage of commercial success, include Azospirillium, Azotobacter, Bacillus Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, and Serratia. But there are several novel PGPR on which considerable information is available, but such organisms have not attained commercial scales of production unlike their better known predecessors. PGPRs like Azoarcus, Exiguobacterium, Methylobacterium, Paenibacillus and Pantoea etc., fall in this category. The information available on these novel PGPRs with regard to their biology and utility are discussed in this review.'

Title: 'Influence of soil pedological properties on termite mound stability'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Termite mound density is similar in ferralsol and in vertisol.\xe2\x80\xa2Stability of termite mound aggregates is reduced compared to control.\xe2\x80\xa2Degradation of termite nests by rain is more important in vertisol than ferralsol.\xe2\x80\xa2Termites impact differently soil dynamics depending on the environment.AbstractThis study investigated the influence of soil properties on the density and shape of epigeous fungus-growing termite nests in a dry deciduous forest in Karnataka, India. In this environment, Odontotermes obesus produces cathedral shaped mounds. Their density, shape (height and volume) and soil physicochemical properties were analyzed in ferralsol and vertisol environments. No significant difference was observed in O. obesus mound density (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa02.7\xc2\xa0mound\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01 on average in the vertisol and ferralsol areas). This study also showed that O. obesus has a limited effect on soil physical properties. No differences in soil particle size, pH, or the C:N ratio and base saturation were measured whereas the C and N contents were reduced and CEC was higher in termite nest soils in both environments. Clay mineralogical composition was also measured, and showed the presence of higher amounts of smectite clays in termite nest soils, which thus explained the increasing CEC despite the reduced C and N content. However, the main difference was the shape of the termite mounds. The degradation of the nests created a hillock of eroded soil at the base of termite mounds in the vertisol while only a thin layer of eroded soil was observed in the ferralsol. The increased degradation of termite mounds in the vertisol is explained by the presence of smectites (2:1 swelling clays), which confer macroscopic swelling and shrinking characteristics to the soil. Soil shrinkage during the dry season leads to the formation of deep cracks in the termite mounds that allow rain to rapidly penetrate inside the mound wall and then breakdown unstable aggregates. In conclusion, it appears that despite a similar abundance, termite mound properties depend to a large extent on the soil properties of their environments.'

Anthropogenically induced hydroclimate change increases geomorphic hazards and risks but also provides new opportunities for mountain landscape enhancement. Each theme is considered with respect to the distinctiveness of mountain geomorphology and in relation to important advances in research over the past decade. The traditional reliance on the high energy condition to define mountain geomorphology seems less important than the presence of unique mountain landforms and landscapes and the distinctive ways in which human activity and anthropogenically induced hydroclimate change are transforming mountain landscapes.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2PLSR models were used to measure the origin of the soil used by termites.\xe2\x80\xa2The origin of termite mound soil is site and species specific.\xe2\x80\xa2Cathedral mound soils are collected at 100 and 50\xc2\xa0cm deep in ferralsol and vertisol.\xe2\x80\xa2Lenticular mound soils are collected at 30 and 60\xc2\xa0cm deep in ferralsol and vertisol.AbstractThis study investigated the origin of the soil termites used to build their above-ground mounds. Termite mounds were surveyed in a ferralsol and a vertisol in a dry deciduous forest in Karnataka, southern India. In these environments, two types of above-ground termite mounds are observed which we describe here as CATHEDRAL and LENTICULAR mounds. Partial Least Squares Regression models (PLSR) were computed from the physical and chemical properties of the soil sampled down to 4 and 2.5\xc2\xa0m in the ferralsol and vertisol, respectively. Soils from CATHEDRAL mounds had the same signatures as soils collected at approximately 100 and 50\xc2\xa0cm deep in the ferralsol and vertisol, respectively. On the other hand, soil from LENTICULAR mounds had the same signature as soil sampled at 30 and 60\xc2\xa0cm deep in the ferralsol and vertisol, respectively. In conclusion, this study highlighted that the source of the soil termites use to build their mounds can be soil (ferralsol vs vertisol) and species (CATHEDRAL vs LENTICULAR) specific. In light of these findings, we conclude that the impact of CATHEDRAL mounds on soil dynamics appears to be smaller than that of LENTICULAR mounds in terms of soil volume at the landscape scale but it is higher in terms of soil translocation from deeper soil layers to the surface.'

Title: "India's biodiversity hotspot under anthropogenic pressure: A case study of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve"

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper presents data on the impact of biotic pressure in terms of grazing by livestock and wood cutting by humans on the plant community in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve of India. Grass, and herbaceous plant biomass, number of cattle dung piles, number of woody stems available and damaged by human activities and weed biomass were assessed at different proximity along transects radiating from village-forest boundary to forest interior to measure the ecological impact of livestock grazing and fire wood collection. The grass biomass was positively correlated to overgrazing indicating the adverse effect on natural vegetation by cattle. Woodcutting was intense along the forest boundary and significantly declined as distance increased. Similarly, weed biomass and number of thorny species declined positively with proximity from village-forest boundary and the weed biomass was significantly higher in the pastoral sites compared to residential sites. The results suggest that human impact adversely affects natural vegetation and promotes weed proliferation in forest areas adjoining human settlements in the ecologically important Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Continued anthropogenic pressure could cause reduction in fodder availability to large herbivores like elephants, which in turn leads to an increase in human\xe2\x80\x93elephant conflict.'

Title: 'Assessing the presence of marine toxins in bivalve molluscs from southwest India'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2First ever systematic study of Indian shellfish toxins.\xe2\x80\xa2Application of chemical detection monitoring.\xe2\x80\xa2Assessment of marine biotoxins.\xe2\x80\xa2PST temporal variability.\xe2\x80\xa2PST profile assessment.AbstractThe south west coast of India has been showing a steady increase in shellfish cultivation both for local consumption and fishery export, over recent years. Perna viridis and Crassostrea madrasensis are two species of bivalve molluscs which grow in some selected regions of southern Karnataka, close to the city of Mangalore. In the early 1980s, shellfish consumers in the region were affected by intoxication from Paralytic Shellfish Poison present in local bivalves (clams and oysters) resulting in hospitalisation of many, including one fatality. Since then, there have been no further reports of serious shellfish intoxication and there is little awareness of the risks from natural toxins and no routine monitoring programme in place to protect shellfish consumers. This study presents the findings from the first ever systematic assessment of the presence of marine toxins in mussels and oysters grown in four different shellfish harvesting areas in the region. Shellfish were collected and subjected to analysis for ASP, PSP and lipophilic toxins, as well as a suite of non-EU regulated toxins such as tetrodotoxin and selected cyclic imines. Results revealed the presence of low levels of PSP toxins in oysters throughout the study period. Overall, total toxicities reached a maximum of 10% of the EU regulatory limit of 800\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg STX eq/kg. Toxin profiles were similar to those reported from the 1980 outbreak. No evidence was found for significant levels of ASP and lipophilic toxins, although some cyclic imines were detected, including gymnodimine. The results indicated that the risk to shellfish consumers during this specific study period would have been low. However, with historical evidence for extremely high levels of PSP toxins in molluscs, there is a strong need for routine surveillance of shellfish production areas for marine toxins, in order to mitigate against human health impacts resulting from unexpected harmful algal blooms, with potentially devastating socio-economic consequences.'

Abstract: "AbstractAccounting for age-dependent patterns of knowledge transmission is critical for understanding cultural evolution in age-structured populations. Cultural evolution theory predicts which social learning biases we expect people to use, but much less often when\xe2\x80\x94during a person's life cycle\xe2\x80\x94 different social learning biases will be used. By measuring knowledge and skill variation among age cohorts, it is possible to infer how people socially acquire different types of knowledge at different ages. We use this strategy among the Jenu Kuruba, a tribal community in South India. We document the accumulation of local knowledge required for collecting wild honey among 71 children and 125 adults from five communities. Combining quantitative measurements of knowledge with measures of four honey-collecting skills and self-reported data on learning age, we infer patterns of social learning across the lifecycle. We find that (1) most knowledge related to honey collecting is acquired by the early 20s, and later social learning mainly functions to update information; (2) the eldest cohort has the highest average explicit knowledge, although the most knowledgeable or skilled individuals do not always belong to the most elderly cohort; (3) length of learning can be affected by age-dependent trade-offs of costs and benefits to learners; and (4) children tend to learn from parents, but individuals use other demonstrators later in life. These results have implications for current models of cultural evolution."

Vadinar was selected as a relatively uncontaminated location for comparison. Cd was accumulated in leaves of the Patalganga and Amba estuarine mangroves; however, at Vadinar it was accumulated and arrested only in roots and stems. Negative correlation of Cr, Cd, Pb and Zn with C in the mangroves suggested that their accumulation may lead to lowered C content in the mangroves. The average C/N ratios in mangroves of the inner Patalganga estuary, Patalganga mouth, and Amba estuary were found to be 80.1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa07.3, 105.8\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa012.5 and 52.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa03.4 respectively, whereas at Vadinar it was well within the expected range (26.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02.8).

Abstract: 'AbstractIn the rare perennial bodies of water of the Sahara desert, only a few fish species have survived to increasing aridification since the end of the last humid period at the Holocene, approximately 5000 years BP. Here, I report the occurrence of an undescribed haplochomine cichlid fish in Lake Boukou, one of the seven Ounianga Serir lakes (Chad). These lakes are located in one of the most arid areas of the Sahara desert, but they persist by virtue of subsurface inflow of fresh groundwater from a large fossil aquifer. Astatotilapia tchadensis sp. nov. is characterized by a black bar between eye and corner of mouth, rounded orange spots on anal fin, scales ctenoid, lower limb of first gill arch with 7\xe2\x80\x938 gill rackers, dorsal fin with 13\xe2\x80\x9314 spines and 9\xe2\x80\x9311 soft rays, anal fin with 3 spines and 8\xe2\x80\x939 soft rays, 29 or 30 lateral line scales, and lower pharyngeal dentition with enlarged molariform teeth. The new species is easily distinguished from A.\xc2\xa0desfontainii and A.\xc2\xa0flaviijosephii, the northernmost haplochromine species currently isolated from its other group members, and appears close to an unnamed species of Lake Chad basin. Ounianga Serir lakes and especially Lake Boukou present a remarkable diversity of fish, the highest known in the Sahara desert with a total of at least six fish species belonging to six genera and three families. They also constitute an exceptional natural landscape inscribed on the UNESCO world heritage list in 2012 and a biodiversity hotspot for desert vertebrate species.R\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9Dans les rares points d\xe2\x80\x99eau permanents du d\xc3\xa9sert du Sahara, seules quelques esp\xc3\xa8ces de poissons ont surv\xc3\xa9cu, malgr\xc3\xa9 l\xe2\x80\x99aridification croissante depuis la fin de la derni\xc3\xa8re p\xc3\xa9riode humide \xc3\xa0 l\xe2\x80\x99Holoc\xc3\xa8ne, il y a environ 5000\xc2\xa0ans.

Abstract: 'AbstractSacred natural sites are considered an additional pillar for biodiversity conservation, next to the protected areas network. However, sacred landscapes are not primarily conservation areas, but exist for cultural and social reasons. To evaluate their strengths and weaknesses as community-based conservation areas, a thorough understanding of the underlying values, institutional arrangements, and outcomes is required. Here, I use institutional economics for a meta-analysis of publications on sacred natural sites to identify potential conflicts in their maintenance, and to analyze institutional arrangements to solve these conflicts. I show that most sacred natural sites resemble common-pool resources and that many design principles that are linked to common-pool resources are also found in traditional institutions managing sacred places. Design principles are no blue-print solution but they may guide future research to identify locally robust institutional arrangements that are linked to the ecological integrity of sacred natural sites.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Sacred natural sites exist for spiritual, cultural, social, economic, and ecological values. \xe2\x96\xba Biodiversity conservation is a concomitant value of sacred natural sites. \xe2\x96\xba Several conflicts of resource management may affect biodiversity negatively. \xe2\x96\xba Interdisciplinary research is required to improve conservation plans of SNS.'

Abstract: 'AbstractHigh population pressure and the rapid pace of human activity including urbanization, industrialization and other economic activities have led to a dwindling supply of arable land per capita as well as water, especially ground water in underdeveloped countries. This has entailed considerable damage to the physical environment, including degradation and depletion of natural resources and unsustainable use of land and water resources. With the impact of climate change, the depletion of water resources will be faster both at the ground as well as the surface level due to rising temperatures in the region. This paper underscores the need for an eclectic approach to policy responses stemming from private and common property rights theories, externality theory and sustainability theory with a view to managing groundwater availability for the poor in terms of equity and sustainability in South Asia, China and Africa.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The Little Ice Age (LIA) was wetter in the Indian Central Himalaya but drier in the core Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) area.\xe2\x80\xa2The pattern was reversed during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the post-LIA periods.\xe2\x80\xa2Weaker ISM during the LIA brought less precipitation thus drought conditions to the core ISM area.\xe2\x80\xa2Weaker ISM during the LIA triggered more monsoon \xe2\x80\x98breaks\xe2\x80\x99 resulting in higher precipitation in Himalayas.AbstractVariations in petrography, stable isotopes, reflectance, and luminescence along the central growth axis of a 14.5\xc2\xa0cm stalagmite from Panigarh cave indicate cooler and slightly wetter conditions in the Himalayan foothills of northern India during the Little Ice Age (LIA), which lasted from \xe2\x88\xbcAD 1489\xe2\x80\x931889 based on deposition of calcite, and AD 1450\xe2\x80\x931820 based on rapid changes in \xce\xb418O values. Conditions were warmer and drier during the preceding Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and also in the post-LIA periods, as evidenced by deposition of aragonite. A review of currently existing stalagmite and other proxy data from south and east Asia reveals a broad spatial pattern in precipitation over south and east Asia during the LIA, with northern areas showing generally increased precipitation and southern areas reduced precipitation. During the MCA and after the LIA, the records suggest this pattern was reversed. Weaker ISM during the LIA brought drought conditions to the core ISM area but triggered more monsoon \xe2\x80\x98breaks\xe2\x80\x99 that brought higher precipitation to the Himalayas. At the same time, the weaker ISM may also have pushed more depressions along the path of the southern winter jet which brought more winter precipitation to the Himalayas and therefore a LIA wetter in our study area.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Birds were surveyed inside protected reserves, in buffer zones, and in agriculture.\xe2\x80\xa2The overall diversity and abundance of birds did not differ between habitats.\xe2\x80\xa2However, forest interior species were found significantly more inside reserves.\xe2\x80\xa2Mixed-species flocks were rare in agriculture, but quite dense in buffers.\xe2\x80\xa2Flocks tended to have more forest interior species than the overall community.AbstractWhile there is no substitute for undisturbed forest, secondary forests and agroforests are increasingly common in tropical areas and may be critical to conservation plans. We compared the diversity and abundance of birds and the characteristics of mixed-species bird flocks in forests inside protected reserves to \xe2\x80\x9cbuffer\xe2\x80\x9d areas, consisting of degraded forests and non-native timber plantations at reserve boundaries, and to agricultural areas. We monitored a network of 57 transects placed over an altitudinal gradient (90\xe2\x80\x932180\xc2\xa0masl) in Sri Lanka and southern India, collecting 398 complete flock observations and 35,686 observations of birds inside and outside of flocks over two\xc2\xa0years. Flocks were rarely found in agricultural areas. However, the density of flocks in buffer areas was similar to that in forests, although buffer flocks were smaller in average flock size and differed significantly in composition, as measured by the proportion of species that were classified, from the literature, as forest interior or open-landscape species. While flock composition was distinct between agricultural, buffer and forest areas, the differences in the composition of flocks was not as great as the differences between the overall communities in these different habitats. Considering buffer transects alone, pine plantations retained fewer forest interior species in flocks than did forests, and small areas of agriculture and abandoned agriculture attracted open-landscape species. Though clearly not equivalent to protected forests, degraded forests and agroforests in buffer areas still hold some conservation value, with forest species found particularly in mixed-species flocks in these human-modified habitats.'

Abstract: 'AbstractGeospatial presentation of habitat status has become a key issue for planning conservation. Biodiversity characters of the habitat provide the basis of prioritizing the sites in conservation effort. Since India is identified as one of the 12-mega biodiversity countries in the world, this task is of great significance. In India, biogeographers have long since recognized North-East India as one of the most diverse regions with respect to flora and fauna. Since historic times, human interventions had started influencing the landuse and landcover of this region. Deforestation is mainly attributed to shifting cultivation and commercial logging of timber. This has resulted in fragmentation of the landscape. Landscape fragmentation and degradation have been identified as fundamental reasons for biodiversity loss. The paper uses landscape ecological principles for biodiversity characterization. Satellite remote sensing data have been used for characterization of the landscape and stratification for ground inventory. A geographic information system has been used to spatially model the disturbance regimes and to integrate the ground based nonspatial data with the spatial characters of the landscape. The vegetation types and landuse of Meghalaya have been mapped using Indian remote sensing (IRS) time series data. The various parameters (viz. patch shape, patch size, number of patches, porosity, fragmentation and juxtaposition) have been analyzed on the most recent landcover map to spatially present the disturbance regimes. A spatial model incorporating ground based biodiversity attributes of the landscape elements, landuse change patterns, disturbance regimes of the landscape and terrain complexity have been used to delineate the spatial pattern of biological richness. This has been achieved using the landscape analysis package (LAP) developed at the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing. Habitat evaluation using ground based data and their spatial organization have been found to provide reliable information on the biodiversity distribution pattern. The present approach for prioritizing the biodiversity rich sites have the advantage of integrating spatial, non-spatial information and horizontal relationships. The information is finally presented in space and time. This approach will facilitate conservation prioritization, systematic inventory and continuous monitoring.'

Title: 'Tibet, the Himalaya, Asian monsoons and biodiversity \xe2\x80\x93 In what ways are they related?'

Abstract: "AbstractPrevailing dogma asserts that the uplift of Tibet, the onset of the Asian monsoon system and high biodiversity in southern Asia are linked, and that all occurred after 23 million years ago in the Neogene. Here, spanning the last 60 million years of Earth history, the geological, climatological and palaeontological evidence for this linkage is reviewed. The principal conclusions are that: 1) A proto-Tibetan highland existed well before the Neogene and that an Andean type topography with surface elevations of at least 4.5\xc2\xa0km existed at the start of the Eocene, before final closure of the Tethys Ocean that separated India from Eurasia. 2) The Himalaya were formed not at the start of the India\xe2\x80\x93Eurasia collision, but after much of Tibet had achieved its present elevation. The Himalaya built against a pre-existing proto-Tibetan highland and only projected above the average height of the plateau after approximately 15\xc2\xa0Ma. 3) Monsoon climates have existed across southern Asia for the whole of the Cenozoic, and probably for a lot longer, but that they were of the kind generated by seasonal migrations of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone. 4) The projection of the High Himalaya above the Tibetan Plateau at about 15\xc2\xa0Ma coincides with the development of the modern South Asia Monsoon. 5) The East Asia monsoon became established in its present form about the same time as a consequence of topographic changes in northern Tibet and elsewhere in Asia, the loss of moisture sources in the Asian interior and the development of a strong winter Siberian high as global temperatures declined. 6) New radiometric dates of palaeontological finds point to southern Asia's high biodiversity originating in the Paleogene, not the Neogene."

Title: 'Geographic variation of floral scent in a highly specialized pollination mutualism'

Abstract: 'AbstractFloral scents are important signals for communication between plants and pollinators. Several studies have focused on interspecific variation of these signals, but little is known about intraspecific variation in flower scent, particularly for species with wide geographic distributions. In the highly specific mutualism between Ficus species and their pollinating wasps, chemical mediation is crucial for partner encounter. Several studies show that scents, i.e. blends of volatiles, are species-specific, but no studies address interpopulation variation of scents in fig pollination mutualisms, which often have broad geographic distributions. In this study, using absorption/desorption headspace techniques, we analyzed variation in floral scent composition among three populations of each of two widely distributed Asian Ficus species. We identified more than 100 different volatile organic compounds, predominantly terpenes. In both species, significant differences were found between scent bouquets of East Asian and Indian populations. These differences are discussed in relation to geographical barriers that could disrupt gene exchange between these two areas, thereby isolating Indian populations from those of Eastern Asia.Graphical abstractReceptive figs of Ficus hispida.

Title: 'What controls local-scale aboveground biomass variation in central Africa? Testing structural, composition and architectural attributes'
Author: 'Grace Jopaul'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2New plots in Celtis and Manilkara forests reveals responsive tree allometry.\xe2\x80\xa2Basal area explains the between- and within-AGB variation.\xe2\x80\xa2Wood density is an important AGB determinant integrating between-site variation.\xe2\x80\xa2The relationships between architectural attributes and AGB are site-specific.\xe2\x80\xa2Compensation exists among structural, composition and architectural attributes.AbstractTropical forests play a key role in regulating the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate change by storing a large amount of carbon. Yet, there is considerable uncertainty about the amount and spatial variation of aboveground biomass (AGB), especially in the relatively less studied African tropical forests. In this study, we explore the local-scale variation and determinants of plot-level AGB, between and within two types of forests, the Celtis and Manilkara forests, growing under the same climate but on different geological substrates in the northern Republic of Congo. In each forest site, all trees \xe2\x89\xa510\xe2\x80\xafcm diameter were censured in 36\xe2\x80\xaf\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\xaf1-ha plots and we measured tree height and crown size using a subsample of 18\xe2\x80\xaf\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\xaf1-ha of these plots. We developed height-diameter and crown-diameter allometric relationships and tested whether they differed between the two sites. For each 1-ha plot, we further estimated the AGB and calculated structural attributes (stem density and basal area), composition attributes (wood density) and architectural attributes (tree height and crown size), the latter being derived from site-specific allometric relationships. We found strong between-site differences in height-diameter and crown-diameter allometries. For a given diameter, trees were taller in the Celtis forest while they had larger crown in the Manilkara forest. Similar trends were found for the sixteen species present in both forest sites, suggesting an environmental control of tree allometry. Although there were some between-site differences in forest structure, composition and architecture, we did not detect any significant difference in mean AGB between the Celtis and the Manilkara forests. The AGB variation was related to the heterogeneous distribution of large trees, and influenced by basal area, height and crown dimensions, and to a lesser extent wood density. These forest attributes have strong practical implications on emerging remote-sensing technologies for carbon monitoring in tropical forests.'

Title: 'Frugivory and seed dispersal by vertebrates in tropical and subtropical Asia: An update'
Author: 'Richard T.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989417300860
Abstract: 'AbstractSeed dispersal is a key process in plant communities and frugivory is very important in vertebrate communities. This paper updates a review of frugivory and seed dispersal by vertebrates in the Oriental Region (tropical and subtropical Asia) published in 1998. The major conclusions remain the same. Small fruits are consumed by a wide range of potential seed dispersal agents, including species that thrive in small forest fragments and degraded landscapes. Larger and larger-seeded fruits are consumed by progressively fewer dispersers, and the largest depend on a few species of mammals and birds which are highly vulnerable to hunting, fragmentation, and habitat loss. Controlling hunting in both forest areas and the agricultural matrix must be a top priority for conservation. A lot more natural history information has been added to the literature since 1998. This reinforces previous evidence for the importance of hornbills, bulbuls, elephants, gibbons, civets, and fruit bats in seed dispersal, and suggests that the roles of green pigeons, macaques, rodents, bears, and deer were previously underestimated. The taxa for which additional natural history observations would be most valuable include fish, pheasants, pigeons, babblers, rodents, and even-toed ungulates. For other animal taxa, future frugivory and seed dispersal studies need to focus more on the fitness consequences for both the plants and the animals.'

Abstract: 'Conservation conflicts represent complex multilayered problems that are challenging to study. We explore the utility of theoretical, experimental, and constructivist approaches to games to help to understand and manage these challenges. We show how these approaches can help to develop theory, understand patterns in conflict, and highlight potentially effective management solutions. The choice of approach should be guided by the research question and by whether the focus is on testing hypotheses, predicting behaviour, or engaging stakeholders. Games provide an exciting opportunity to help to unravel the complexity in conflicts, while researchers need an awareness of the limitations and ethical constraints involved. Given the opportunities, this field will benefit from greater investment and development.'

Title: 'Research papersA tropical forest of the middle Miocene of Fujian (SE China) reveals Sino-Indian biogeographic affinities'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Six new species from a middle Miocene flora of South-East China are described.\xe2\x80\xa2The newly recognize genera mostly represent tropical elements.\xe2\x80\xa2The Fotan palaeoflora has biogeographic affinities with Miocene Indian floras.\xe2\x80\xa2The mid-Miocene climatic optimum favoured a northward movement of tropical forests.AbstractThe middle Miocene Fotan flora of Zhangpu County, South Fujian, China has been considered to represent tropical rainforest based on the occurrence of distinctive winged fruit fossils of the Dipterocarpaceae. However, this paleoclimatic interpretation has been challenged. In this study, we describe new tropical and subtropical elements of this flora that co-occurred with Dipterocarpaceae based on newly collected fossil leaves from the Fotan flora. The fossils were identified through detailed comparison with leaves of living plants. Six new species belonging to six different families are described: Artocarpus basirotundatus sp. nov. (Moraceae), Bauhinia fotana sp. nov. (Leguminosae), Boehmeria fujianensis sp. nov. (Urticaceae), Calophyllum striatum sp. nov. (Calophyllaceae), Flacourtia serrulata sp. nov. (Salicaceae), and Macaranga stellata sp. nov. (Euphorbiaceae). They represent the first fossil records of these genera in China, with the exception of Bauhinia. These elements provide further evidence for the recognition of tropical forest in South Fujian during the middle Miocene. They show more affinities with Indian Neogene floras than with other Chinese palaeofloras. It suggests that, during the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum, the border between the tropical and subtropical vegetation moved north to South Fujian. The Fotan palaeoflora is the first record of Miocene floristic affinities between Indian and South Chinese floras. In contrast, the southwestern Chinese Miocene palaeofloras have a different floristic composition without clear Indian affinities. We propose that the route of exchange between the Indian and South Chinese Miocene floras passed through South-East Asia.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Groundwater is increasingly relied on in arid and semi-arid regions.\xe2\x80\xa2Unsustainable groundwater use contributes to ecological and socio-economic decline.\xe2\x80\xa2Community-based groundwater recharge in semi-arid Rajasthan reversed this cycle.\xe2\x80\xa2Success was achieved through traditional governance and water harvesting structures.\xe2\x80\xa2Transferrable lessons arise from structured analysis of linked success factors.AbstractGroundwater is a vital resource in arid and semi-arid regions, increasingly relied upon for year-round access, though lack of both study and regulation contribute to unsustainable pressures potentially contributing to a negative spiral of ecological, social and economic decline. Using field visits, interviews with locals and experts, and literature reviews, we explored a successful programme of community-based groundwater recharge in three adjacent catchments (the Arvari, Sarsa and Baghani) in semi-arid north Rajasthan, India, led by the NGO Tarun Bharat Sangh (TBS) in order to determine how successes were achieved and could be replicated. TBS-led initiatives rebuilt traditional village governance structures and participation in community-designed and maintained water harvesting structures (WHSs), which were efficient both economically and in technical design using indigenous knowledge. Enhanced seasonal groundwater recharge enabled by WHSs regenerated aquatic, farmed and natural ecosystems, underpinning a positive cycle of interdependent social and economic regeneration. Locally appropriate, integrated social and technical solutions maintaining this positive cycle have increased the quality of ecosystems and the wellbeing of local people. We used the STEEP (Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political) framework to stratify outcomes, exploring principles underpinning successful local and catchment-scale regeneration and drawing out lessons transferrable to similarly water-stressed regions.'

Title: 'Interactions between protected areas and their surroundings in human-dominated tropical landscapes'
Author: 'Ruth'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320710000492
Abstract: 'AbstractProtected areas (PAs) often depend on landscapes surrounding them to maintain flows of organisms, water, nutrients, and energy. Park managers have little authority over the surrounding landscape although land use change and infrastructure development can have major impacts on the integrity of a PA. The need for scientifically-based regional-scale land use planning around protected areas is acute in human-dominated landscapes to balance conservation goals with livelihood needs for fuelwood, fodder, and other ecosystem services. As a first step, we propose the designation of a \xe2\x80\x9czone of interaction\xe2\x80\x9d (ZOI) around PAs that encompasses hydrologic, ecological, and socioeconomic interactions between a PA and the surrounding landscape. We illustrate the concept by delineating the ZOI in three Indian PAs \xe2\x80\x93 Kanha, Ranthambore, and Nagarahole \xe2\x80\x93 using remote sensing, population census, and field data. The ZOI in Ranthambore is three times the size of the park and is largely defined by the socioeconomic interactions with surrounding villages. Ranthambore is located in headwaters and wildlife corridors are largely severed. In Nagarahole, the ZOI is more than seven times larger than the park and includes upstream watershed and elephant corridors. Kanha\xe2\x80\x99s ZOI is approximately four times larger than the park and is mostly defined by contiguous surrounding forest. The three examples highlight the differing extents of ZOIs when applying equivalent criteria, even though all are located in densely-populated landscapes. Quantitative understanding of which activities (e.g. collection of forest products, grazing, road construction, tourism development) and which locations within the ZOI are most crucial to conservation goals will enable improved land use planning around PAs in human-dominated landscapes.'

Title: 'Low flow and high flow responses to converting natural grassland into bluegum (Eucalyptus globulus) in Nilgiris watersheds of South India'
Author: 'A.K'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169402001725
Abstract: 'AbstractA concern has been raised in many parts of the world over the effect of large scale planting of Eucalyptus on hydrological behaviour of small watersheds. Hydrological response of watersheds due to conversion of natural grasslands into bluegum (Eucalyptus globulus) plantations on low flows and high flows has been presented in this paper. The concept of using low flow index (LFI) as a tool to study and quantify the effects of bluegum plantation on low flow regime has been demonstrated. Conversion of natural grasslands into bluegum plantations has resulted in decreased low flow volume as well as peak flow, which in turn increased the soil moisture losses. These effects were more pronounced during the second rotation (i.e. first coppiced growth) as compared to the first rotation. Significant reduction in low flow as a result of decline in base flow could be predicted with LFI decreasing by 2.0 and 3.75 times, in the first and second rotation, respectively. Moderation in peak discharge rates was also observed as a result of bluegum plantation. Probability plots of peak discharge tend to suggest that the effect of bluegum plantation on peak flows become insignificant for the floods with higher return periods. These results clearly suggest that caution need to be exercised while planning large scale conversion of natural grasslands into bluegum plantations in the catchments of hydro-electric reservoirs in the Nilgiris which adversely affects water availability especially during lean flow period.'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Macrofauna varies with organic matter quality and soil depth in mountain agroecosystems.\xe2\x80\xa2Macrofauna contributes to higher decomposition of leaf litter than defaunated control plots.\xe2\x80\xa2Macrofauna excluded soil has low available nutrients than defaunated control plots.AbstractIn agroecosystems, rich soil biodiversity performs a variety of ecological services and contributes to sustainability of agriculture. In spite of the vast knowledge on this subject globally, the Himalayan mountain agroecosystems remain almost unexplored, and the agriculture is practiced on a subsistence level in the desire of suitable soil fertility management practices. This study was conducted on the soil macrofauna community and its influence on litter decomposition, nutrient release and soil quality in rainfed wheat-paddy cropping systems in two major agroecosystems in the central Himalayan mountains. Following local farmers' practice, Oak leaf litter (agroecosystem-I) and Pine forests leaf litter (agroecosystem-II) were used for farm yard manure (FYM) preparation for soil fertility restoration. Control (traditional cropfields) and treatment (macrofauna excluded plots) were maintained in this study. In both the agroecosystems, 11 soil macrofauna groups were recorded across 0\xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xa0cm soil depths over an annual crop cycle. Total macrofauna density in the rhizosphere zone of agroecosystem-I was significantly greater (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01) than in agroecosystem-II (2477 vs. 2241\xc2\xa0ind\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922), and it was particularly significantly greater (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01) in the top soil (0\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0cm depth) of agroecosystem-I (2321 vs. 1877\xc2\xa0ind\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922). With regards to macrofauna taxonomic groups and population density our study area falls in the middle range reported for the world (taxonomic groups\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa011-22; population density\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01637\xe2\x80\x939500\xc2\xa0ind\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922). Decomposition of the Oak and Pine leaf litter was significantly lower (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01) in macrofauna-excluded litter bags in agroecosystem-I (63.4 vs. 49.4%) than in agroecosystem-II (44.4 vs. 29.2%). Levels of available nutrients (NO3-N,NH4-N, PO4-P and available K) were significantly higher in the soil of control plots than in treatment plots. This study concludes that soil macrofauna plays an important role in litter decomposition and soil quality maintenance, and recommends that nutrient rich Oak leaf litter should be preferred over Pine leaf litter to promote macrofauna diversity and abundance and soil quality enhancement in the rainfed farming of Central Himalaya."

Title: 'Large mammal fossil occurrences and associated archaeological evidence in Pleistocene contexts of peninsular India and Sri Lanka'
Author: 'Parth R.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe Indian subcontinent represents a rich source of diverse paleoanthropological data in the form of pollen assemblages, various isotopic records, vertebrate and invertebrate fossil assemblages, and prehistoric stone tools in a range of palaeoecological contexts. Most of the Quaternary fossil evidence, including hominin specimens, comes from the fluvial sediments of the Narmada and other similar rivers. Although abundant and well-preserved vertebrate fossil assemblages are known from the Siwalik Hills and Karewa deposits in the north, similar evidence is less well-known from peninsular India and Sri Lanka to the south. With the exception of two occurrences in Gujarat and Bihar, there is an almost complete absence of Neogene fossil evidence older than the Middle Pleistocene in peninsular India and late Middle Pleistocene in Sri Lanka. The richest non-fluvial sources of vertebrate fossils are represented by the Kurnool cave-complex in southern India and numerous cave and open-air deposits in Sri Lanka, the majority of which are Upper Pleistocene age. This unique faunal record of peninsular India and Sri Lanka probably played a critical role in influencing the dispersal, settlement, and subsistence behaviors of Pleistocene hominins. This paper summarizes the known Pleistocene megafauna fossil occurrences from peninsular India and Sri Lanka and includes key lithic associations with these assemblages.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIn this study an analysis was made on spatial variation of climatic water balance, (water surplus, actual evapotranspiration), probabilistic monthly monsoon rainfall and mapping of cold periods in agro-ecological region (AER) 12.0 of India using GIS and models. Since, rice is the dominant crop of the region, crop water requirements of rice was also spatially analyzed in different agro-ecological subregions (AESRs) of the AER 12.0 using CROPWAT 4.0 model and GIS. Study found that as per climatic water balance, large to moderate water surplus (520\xe2\x80\x9370\xc2\xa0mm) was available in AESR 12.1. The rainfall surplus of 220\xe2\x80\x93370\xc2\xa0mm was computed in AESR 12.2 and 370\xe2\x80\x93520\xc2\xa0mm in AESR 12.3\xc2\xa0mm.

Title: 'Human impact on low-land Vellayani Lake, south India: A record since 3000\xc2\xa0yrs BP'

Abstract: 'AbstractHumans have continuously changed the landscape and vegetation cover of the earth, including deserts and lake margins. Vellayani Lake, Kerala, is being severely affected by human activity in the catchment basin. Population increase, leading to increased demand for agricultural land and water, is driving a positive feedback loop resulting in the accelerating siltation of the lake and lowering of water levels. A 145\xc2\xa0cm sediment core represents deposition since 3000\xc2\xa0yrs BP, but at least half of the sediment has been deposited since 1650 AD, possibly since 1950 AD. The sediment stratigraphy is disturbed, most likely by slumping since 1970, of an unstable sediment accumulation near the lake margin. The disturbance precludes detailed interpretation of paleoenvironmental proxies, textural variation, chemical weathering index, pollen and phytolith assemblages. The proxies provide evidence of drier climate up to 3000\xc2\xa0yrs BP, and wetter conditions at about 1210\xc2\xa0yrs BP. Low frequency of phytoliths morph types indicates reduction in vegetation cover and a significant increase in grassland since 2300\xc2\xa0yrs BP due to climate warming, weakened southwest monsoon, deforestation reclamation of the lake margins for intensive agricultural practices. Occurrence of diatoms and sponge spicules indicate shallowing of the lake from 2300\xc2\xa0yrs BP onwards. Occurrence of charcoal pieces post 3000\xc2\xa0yrs BP represents human impact. Integration of all the results show that the Vellayani Lake has contracted because of a weakened Indian southwest monsoon since 3000\xc2\xa0yrs BP, intense human impact in the form of deforestation, irrigation and agricultural practices.'

Abstract: 'AbstractCoastal and estuarine waters are highly productive and dynamic ecosystems. The complex carbohydrate composition of the ecosystem would lead to colonisation of microbial communities with abilities to produce an array of complex carbohydrate degrading enzymes. We have examined the abundance and phylogenetic diversity of culturable bacteria with abilities to produce complex carbohydrate degrading enzymes in the Mondovi and Zuari eustauri. It was interesting to note that 65% of isolated bacteria could produce complex carbohydrate degrading enzymes. A majority of these bacteria belonged to Bacillus genera followed by Vibrio, Marinobacter, Exiquinobacterium, Alteromonas, Enterobacter and Aeromonas. Most abundant bacterial genus to degrade hemicellulose and cellulose were Bacillus and Vibrio respectively. Most abundant bacterial genus to degrade hemicellulose and cellulose were Bacillus and Vibrio respectively.

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Land use change is the most visible and complex form of change triggered by several determinants.\xe2\x80\xa2As multiple drivers shape land use change, transdisciplinary research is requisite for management.\xe2\x80\xa2Geospatial data, tools and techniques offers potential to connect disciplinary knowledge.\xe2\x80\xa2Role of effective \xe2\x80\x98entry points\xe2\x80\x99 is key to develop and scale transdisciplinary understanding.\xe2\x80\xa2LCLUC is explained as a good entry point.AbstractThis article highlights applied understanding of classifying earth imaging data for land cover land use change (LCLUC) information. Compared to the many previous studies of LCLUC, the present study is innovative in that it applied geospatial data, tools and techniques for transdisciplinary research. It contributes to a wider discourse on practical decision making for multi-level governance. Undertaken as part of the BioDIVA project, the research adopted a multi-tiered methodical approach across three key dimensions: socioecology as the sphere of interest, a transdisciplinary approach as the disciplinary framework, and geospatial analysis as the applied methodology. The area of interest was the agroecosystem of Wayanad district in Kerala, India (South Asia). The methodology was structured to enable analysis of multi-scalar and multi-temporal data, using Wayanad as a case study. Three levels of analysis included: District (Landsat TM-30m), Taluk or sub-district (ASTER-15m) and Village or Gram Panchayat (GeoEye-0.5m). Our hypothesis, that analyzing patterns of land use change is pertinent for up-to-date assessment of agroecosystem resources and their wise management is supported by the outcome of the multi-tiered geospatial analysis. In addition, two examples from the project that highlight the adoption of LCLUC by different disciplinary experts are presented. A sociologist assessed the land ownership boundary for a selected tribal community. A faunal ecologist used it to assess the effect of landscape structure on arthropods and plant groups in rice fields. Furthermore, the Google Earth interface was used to support the overall validation process. Our key conclusion was that a multi-level understanding of the causes, effects, processes and mechanisms that govern agroecosystem transformation requires close attention to spatial, temporal and seasonal dynamics, for which the incorporation of local knowledge and participation of local communities is crucial.'

Abstract: 'AbstractScholars and advocates increasingly favor rights-based approaches over traditional exclusionary policies in conservation. Yet, national and international conservation policies and programs have often led to the exclusion of forest-dependent peoples. This article proposes and tests the hypothesis that the failures of rights-based approaches in conservation can be attributed in significant measure to the political economic interest of the state in the tropics. To this end, the article presents findings from the empirical analysis of the Forest Rights Act of 2006 in India. Two key recommendations emerge from this analysis. One, the proposals for operationalizing rights-based approaches will likely be far more effective if they protect the inalienability of a minimal set of rights critical to the subsistence and well-being of forest people, as opposed to promising the protection of an expansive set of rights subject to the instrumentality of conservation. Two, the proponents of rights-based approaches in conservation need to guard against their actions reinforcing the institutional status quo of the state control of forests. This, in turn, requires international conservation groups to join hands with national forest rights movements.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Political economic analysis of the proposals for rights-based approaches in conservation. \xe2\x96\xba Identifies state control of natural resources as the key barrier. \xe2\x96\xba Recommends an emphasis on a minimal set of inalienable forest rights. \xe2\x96\xba Recommends conservation groups to join hands with forest rights movements to demand state accountability.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe role of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) fungi symbiosis with bamboo seedling was investigated. VAM species Glomus aggregatum, G. fasciculatum and G. mosseae were inoculated individually and in combinations with the bamboo seedlings. The percentage of infection and various growth parameters such as the number of shoots, number of rhizome, internodal distance, leaf length and breadth and total biomass production were studied in myocorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal infected plants. The above findings indicated a significant increase in the growth rate and biomass productivity.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe cultivation of cash crops in the understorey of tropical forests is an ancient practice, but the effects of cultivation on forest ecosystem processes are poorly understood. We assessed the effects of planting the high-value spice crop cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum) on forest structure, tree species composition, and soil properties in the montane forests of the Knuckles Forest Reserve in central Sri Lanka, where cardamom cultivation has been banned since 1985 because of the high conservation value of this site. Vegetation and soil were sampled in forest under-planted with cardamom and adjacent natural forests without planted cardamom. The densities of woody plants (\xe2\xa9\xbe5\xc2\xa0cm\xc2\xa0dbh), saplings (<5\xc2\xa0cm\xc2\xa0dbh and \xe2\xa9\xbe1.5\xc2\xa0m tall), and seedlings (<1.5\xc2\xa0m tall) were lower in cardamom plantations than natural forests, while stand basal area was marginally higher in cardamom plantations. Canopy openness at 1.3\xc2\xa0m height was higher in the cardamom plantations (mean\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa0SEM: 35\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa08%) than in the natural forests (19\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa03%). Pioneer tree species such as Macaranga sp. increased in abundance in cardamom plantations, and this contributed to the emergence of a difference in species composition between cardamom plantations and adjacent natural forests. Species richness of trees \xe2\xa9\xbe5\xc2\xa0cm\xc2\xa0dbh per plot was higher in natural forests than cardamom plantations, while species diversity was higher in cardamom plantations. The concentration of total N in top-soil was higher in natural forests, while concentrations of total P and exchangeable K were higher in the cardamom plantations. We conclude that cardamom cultivation results in a net loss of tree stems through weeding and opening of the canopy to promote cardamom production. The higher concentrations of total P and exchangeable K in the soil of cardamom plantations may be associated with the application of fertilizer, while total N concentration may have been higher in the natural forests because residual uncultivated forest occurs at a slightly higher elevation than the majority of cardamom plantations and/or because of elevated denitrification rates in the cardamom plantation. Since cardamom cultivation has affected forest structure and soil properties, management interventions may be required to mitigate these effects in high conservation value forests where cardamom cultivation has been banned.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba We investigated the effects of cardamom cultivation on high conservation value montane rain forests in central Sri Lanka. \xe2\x96\xba The density of trees, saplings and seedlings were lower in abandoned cardamom plantations than adjacent natural forests. \xe2\x96\xba Cardamom cultivation resulted in a shift in tree species composition with the addition of pioneer species. \xe2\x96\xba Cultivation increased concentrations of total P and exchangeable K in soil, but lowered total N. \xe2\x96\xba Cardamom cultivation has persistent impacts on forest that need to be mitigated.'

The results also showed that production of the major DTXs A, B, C, and E have to be determined in Czapek Dextrose (CD) liquid culture filtrate from 9 to 12 days post-inoculation. Purified DTX were further tested in bioassays to assess their effects of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The four major purified DTX compounds were found to cause a toxic effect on the larval developmental stages of mosquitoes with high mortality rates. However, DTX E outperformed the other three DTXs by causing the highest mortality three days after inoculation. This result gives an alternative approach of using DTXs in mosquitoes control and used as a new method for other pest management.'

Title: 'Environmental isotopes to test hypotheses for fluid mud (mud bank) generation mechanisms along the southwest coast of India'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Hypotheses on the occurrence and sustenance of fluid mud have been evaluated.\xe2\x80\xa2Subsurface flows & riverine processes are not responsible for fluid mud formation.\xe2\x80\xa2Environmental isotope, hydrogeology and field survey techniques have been used.\xe2\x80\xa2Isotope data was successfully used for hypothesis testing.AbstractOccurrence of fluid mud (mud banks) in the southwest coast of India is an enigma for the scientific community. Over the years, several multi-disciplinary studies were conducted and various hypotheses were postulated on the occurrence and sustenance of fluid mud. Nevertheless, none of them could be proved or disproved with field data. In the present study, an attempt was made to assess the validity of some of the prevailing hypothesis on its occurrence such as subterranean conduit flow of mud/water from a coastal lagoon, submarine groundwater discharge, river flows etc. by integrating field surveys, refining the hydrogeological understanding of the area and application of environmental isotopes (222Rn, \xce\xb418O, \xce\xb42H and 3H) in the \xe2\x80\x98Alappuzha mud bank\xe2\x80\x99 region, Kerala, during its formation in the southwest monsoon period. In-situ 222Rn monitoring survey in the coastal waters of Pallana showed that 222Rn activities in the fluid mud region were negligible compared to the suspected continental end members such as Pamba River, Vembanad Lagoon, shallow and deep groundwater indicating that there was no freshwater inputs from these sources. Comparison of the characteristic stable isotopic signatures of \xce\xb418O and \xce\xb42H in the samples from the fluid mud region and the suspected continental end members implied that there was no mixing of these water sources with the seawater. 3H results indicated that the shallow groundwater is modern and recharged annually from precipitation while deep groundwater in the Warkali aquifer within the study area is old (>50 years). It also indicated that there is no vertical interconnection between the Vembanad Lagoon and the deep Warkali aquifers. Hence, from the study, it appears that river flows, submarine groundwater discharge or subterranean (conduit flow) flow from the Vembanad Lagoon may not be responsible for the occurrence and sustenance of fluid mud in Pallana coast, Alappuzha.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2To conserve the tiger it is critical to enable the persistence of the species across larger landscapes.\xe2\x80\xa2Establishing protected areas for tiger recovery remains one of the means of landscape approach.\xe2\x80\xa2While the gazetting of protected areas is necessary to enable this, it is not sufficient.\xe2\x80\xa2It is essential to benchmark and monitor the process that enable the recovery of tigers.AbstractTo conserve a large, wide-ranging carnivore like the tiger, it is critical not only to maintain populations at key habitat sites, but also to enable the persistence of the species across much larger landscapes. To do this, it is important to establish well-linked habitat networks where sites for survival and reproduction of tigers are complemented by opportunities for dispersal and colonization. On the ground, expanding protection to areas with a potential for tiger recovery still remains the means of operationalizing the landscape approach. Yet, while the gazetting of protected areas is necessary to enable this, it is not sufficient. It is essential to benchmark and monitor the process by which establishment of protected areas must necessarily be followed by management changes that enable a recovery of tigers, their prey and their habitats. In this paper, we report a case study from the Cauvery and Malai Mahadeshwara Hills Wildlife Sanctuaries of southern India, where we document the infrastructural and institutional changes that ensued after an unprecedented expansion of protected areas in this landscape. Further, we establish ecological benchmarks of the abundance and distribution of tigers, the relative abundance of their prey, and the status of their habitats, against which the recovery of tigers in this area of vast conservation potential may be assessed over time.'

Abstract: 'AbstractEnvironmental disasters and socio-ecological vulnerability associated with human capacity in any disaster affected region of the world is considered as a key factor in understanding the occurrence of environmental disasters, and consequently, in developing and applying adequate strategies for prevention. The identification of risks and the factors responsible for vulnerability are crucial in analysis and framing strategies for coping and adaptation to the situation. The present paper focuses on identification of potential indicators for disaster risk assessment, socio-economic and cultural vulnerability of local people while striving to cope with shocks of disaster and adaptation and coping strategies of people to mitigate the impact of disaster in Kedarnath valley of Uttarakhand. Based on the long term research and assessment of potential cost-effective bio-resources available locally, this article recommends some of the priority interventions and technology packages for the immediate implementation as well as capacity building of the community to make them economically sustainable and future-ready to respond swiftly towards such catastrophe with less negative impact.

Abstract: 'AbstractThe use of molecular techniques is rapidly growing as the tools have become more diverse and powerful, more widely available, and easier to implement. Molecular analyses are able to elucidate information about target weeds that is critical to improving control success, such as taxonomic clarification, evidence of hybridization and cryptic species, better development of test plant lists, population structure and origin of invasions. Similarly, molecular approaches can improve our knowledge of biological control agents, providing taxonomic clarity, identification of immature arthropods and fungal pathogens, and description of genetic variability in agents. Molecular tools also allow easier identification of host associations and provide a tool for post-release evaluation and tracking of agents. This review provides an overview of how to use molecular approaches in biological control of weeds, with the aim of assisting the adoption and facilitating fruitful collaboration between scientists studying the biology and ecology of agents and their targets and those with skills using molecular approaches. We describe the current molecular techniques relevant to classical biological control of weeds, instruct how to collect field materials for molecular analyses, and give recent examples of the use of molecular methods in biological control of weeds, with comments on the most appropriate methods for analysis of molecular data.Graphical abstractThe typical project stages of biological control of weeds programs, their key needs, and how molecular techniques may be applied to address those needs.Download full-size imageHighlights\xe2\x96\xba The current toolbox of molecular techniques. \xe2\x96\xba How to properly collect field materials for molecular analyses. \xe2\x96\xba Examples of use of molecular-based approaches in biological control of weeds. \xe2\x96\xba Future trends.'

Abstract: 'AbstractGap formation and closure represent important disturbance events in forests, but the processes involved are still poorly understood. We use models, which we and others previously developed, to make long-term predictions of tropical forest gap dynamics based on Barro Colorado Island data. We first fit the models to the data by comparing their discrete Fourier transforms, and we propose a definition for the lifetime of a gap and predict a large-gap lifetime typically to be less than 50 years. We find that the gap lifetime diverges logarithmically for large-gap sizes. We examine the \xe2\x80\x98memory\xe2\x80\x99 of spatial gap patterns via spatiotemporal correlations and find a correlation time of about 160 years, suggesting that present gap patterns could have long-lasting effects on forest spatial patterns.'

Title: 'Revisiting the earthquake sources in the Himalaya: Perspectives on past seismicity'
Author: 'Kusala'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040195111000837
Abstract: 'AbstractThe ~\xc2\xa02500\xc2\xa0km-long Himalaya plate boundary experienced three great earthquakes during the past century, but none of them generated any surface rupture. The segments between the 1905\xe2\x80\x931934 and the 1897\xe2\x80\x931950 sources, known as the central and Assam seismic gaps respectively, have long been considered holding potential for future great earthquakes. This paper addresses two issues concerning earthquakes along the Himalaya plate boundary. One, the absence of surface rupture associated with the great earthquakes, vis-\xc3\xa0-vis the purported large slip observed from paleoseismological investigations and two, the current understanding of the status of the seismic gaps in the Central Himalaya and Assam, in view of the paleoseismological and historical data being gathered. We suggest that the ruptures of earthquakes nucleating on the basal detachment are likely to be restricted by the crustal ramps and thus generate no surface ruptures, whereas those originating on the faults within the wedges promote upward propagation of rupture and displacement, as observed during the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, that showed a peak offset of 7\xc2\xa0m. The occasional reactivation of these thrust systems within the duplex zone may also be responsible for the observed temporal and spatial clustering of earthquakes in the Himalaya. Observations presented in this paper suggest that the last major earthquake in the Central Himalaya occurred during AD 1119\xe2\x80\x931292, rather than in 1505, as suggested in some previous studies and thus the gap in the plate boundary events is real. As for the Northwestern Himalaya, seismically generated sedimentary features identified in the 1950 source region are generally younger than AD 1400 and evidence for older events is sketchy. The 1897 Shillong earthquake is not a d\xc3\xa9collement event and its predecessor is probably ~\xc2\xa01000\xc2\xa0years old. Compared to the Central Himalaya, the Assam Gap is a corridor of low seismicity between two tectonically independent seismogenic source zones that cannot be considered as a seismic gap in the conventional sense.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We present a new methodology for identifying ancient rice arable systems.\xe2\x80\xa2We create modern analogues of phytolith assemblages of rice weeds from modern fields.\xe2\x80\xa2These analogues are used as models to understand archaeobotanical samples.\xe2\x80\xa2We present an analysis of different systems from Neolithic India and China.AbstractRice can be cultivated in a range of arable systems, including upland rainfed, lowland rainfed or irrigated, flooded or d\xc3\xa9crue, and deep water cultivation. These agricultural regimes represent ecosystems controlled to large degree by agricultural practices, and can be shown to produce different weed flora assemblages. In order to reconstruct early rice cultivation systems it is necessary to better establish how ancient rice farming practices may be seen using archaeobotanical data. This paper focuses on using modern analogue phytolith assemblages of associated crop weeds found within cultivation regimes, as well as in wild rice stands (unplanted stands of Oryza nivara or Oryza rufipogon), as a means of interpreting archaeobotanical assemblages. Rice weeds and sediment samples have been recorded and collected from a range of arable systems and wild stands in India. The husks, leaves and culms of associated weeds were processed for phytolith reference samples, and sediment samples were processed for phytoliths in order to establish patterns identifiable to specific systems. The preliminary results of the phytolith analysis of samples from these modern fields demonstrate that phytolith assemblage statistics show correlation with variation in rice cultivation systems on the basis of differences in environmental conditions and regimes, with wetness being one major factor. Analysis of phytoliths from archaeological samples from contrasting systems in Neolithic China and India demonstrate how this method can be applied to separate archaeological regions and periods based on inferred differences in past agricultural practices, identifying wet cultivation systems in China, dry millet-dominated agriculture of north China and rainfed/dry rice in Neolithic India.'

It has been reported from four species, belonging to the families, Meliaceae and Rubiaceae. Stem bark of Dysoxylum binectariferum (Meliaceae) accumulates the highest amount of rohitukine (3\xe2\x80\x937% by dry weight). In this study, we examine the spatial and temporal distribution of rohitukine and related compounds during various stages of seed development in D. binectariferum using desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI MSI). Rohitukine (m/z 306.2) accumulation increased from early seed development to seed maturity stage. The spatial distribution of rohitukine was largely restricted to the cotyledonary tissue followed by the embryo and least in the seed coat. Besides rohitukine, rohitukine acetate (m/z 348.2) and glycosylated rohitukine (m/z 468.2) were also detected, both through mass fragmentation and exact mass analysis through Orbitrap mass spectrometry. These results indicate a dynamic pattern of chromane alkaloid accumulation through seed development in D. binectariferum.Graphical abstractThe present study reports the spatial and temporal distribution of chromone alkaloid, rohitukine and its related compounds during various stages of seed development in Dysoxylum binectariferum (Meliaceae) using desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI MSI).Download high-res image (211KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Comparisons of litterfall, litter decomposition and nutrient return in a monoculture Cunninghamia lanceolata and a mixed stand in southern China'

Abstract: 'AbstractLitter production, leaf litter decomposition and nutrient return were compared in a monoculture Cunninghamia lanceolata and a mixed stand in southern China. The mean annual litter production was significantly higher 24% in the mixed stand than the monoculture C. lanceolata stand. Within the mixed stand, about 38% of the total litterfall was from broadleaved tree Michelia macclurei. The litterfall was concentrated during the cool and dry period (November\xe2\x80\x93March) and about 65% of total litterfall occurred during this period. The mass loss of leaf litter was positively correlated with N and P content and negatively correlated with C/N ratio. The decomposition rate of leaf litter in the pure stand was increased in the order: C. lanceolata\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa0mixture of C. lanceolata and M. macclurei\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa0M. macclurei. Soil conditions also affected litter decomposition. The decomposition rate of mixed litter was slightly, but not significantly, faster in the mixed stand than the pure stand. N concentration in all leaf litters increased over time during decomposition, whereas the remaining amount of N decreased. The returns of N, P and K via leaf litter were significantly higher in mixed stand than pure stand, but the returns of C, Ca and Mg between both stands did not differ significantly. The percent contribution of M. macclurei leaf litter to total nutrient return varied from 23% to 79% in the mixed stand. Our results indicated that introduction of broadleaved tree into monoculture coniferous stand could increase litter production, nutrient return and thus it had advantages in degraded soil restoration and sustainable land management.'

Title: 'An ecophysiological evaluation of the suitability of Eucalyptus grandis for planting in the tropics'
Author: 'J.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112797000042
Abstract: 'AbstractWater use by eucalypts has received a lot of attention in tropical countries during the past decade because of the large-scale introduction of these trees for afforestation. Eucalyptus grandis, widely used as a plantation item in tropical southern India, is the subject of a detailed ecophysiological study in this paper. A 4-year-old coppiced plantation was used for measurements. Microclimate data collected above the canopy were used along with stomatal conductance measurements to estimate the transpirational water loss by the Penman-Monteith equation assuming a two-layer canopy model. Leaf photosynthesis was measured diurnally and seasonally to understand the limitations in photosynthesis in the field. Results show that the water loss from the plantation ranges between 2.5 and 6.5 mm day\xe2\x88\x921 depending on the season. When suitably extrapolated, this amounts to 1181 mm annually in the study location, where annual rainfall averages 1302 mm. The stomatal conductance measurements showed that the increase in atmospheric vapour pressure deficit induced stomatal closure. This was probably regulated by the leaf water potentials also. Based on the above results it is concluded that E. grandis need not be a high water consumer because of its good stomatal control of transpirational water loss, especially during the dry season when the atmospheric vapour pressure deficit is high. The photosynthesis measurements led to a conclusion that the dry period experienced in the study location does not seriously affect the photosynthetic rate of the trees on a leaf unit area basis.'

Title: 'Overcoming the Linnean shortfall: Data deficiency and biological survey priorities'
Author: 'Daniel'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179110001246
Abstract: "AbstractKnowledge of biodiversity is woefully inadequate. Only a fraction of the planet's species has been described by science (the \xe2\x80\x9cLinnean shortfall\xe2\x80\x9d). Even for described species, scientists often have only fragmentary information about their distributions (the \xe2\x80\x9cWallacean\xe2\x80\x9d shortfall). These shortfalls in biodiversity knowledge place serious limitations on the ability to conserve biodiversity in the face of the ongoing extinction crisis. Here, I test the hypothesis that data deficiency may be used to guide surveys and inventories to regions that would increase the probability of discovering new species. I compiled global distribution maps for all Data Deficient amphibian species (species described up to 2004) and constructed a Data Deficiency (DD) surface (the DD surface was based on distribution information obtained from the IUCN Red List). Then, I compared the type-locality sites of new amphibian species descriptions (species described between 2005 and 2009) with the DD surface in order to check if new species discoveries were significantly more abundant within the DD surface or not. Even though the amphibian DD species surface covers only 8% of Earth's land area, 79% of the amphibian species discovered between 2005 and 2009 were within the DD surface. The results suggest that directing surveys towards areas of known data deficiency will likely result in the discovery of species new to science, helping to address the Linnean shortfall. Incorporating DD information from the IUCN Red List may provide an efficient methodology for strategically targeting surveys and inventories, maximizing the chances of obtaining high conservation benefits from them, and helping minimize the costs associated with such endeavours.ZusammenfassungDie Kenntnis der Biodiversit\xc3\xa4t ist von trauriger Unzul\xc3\xa4nglichkeit.

Title: 'Tropical forest recovery: legacies of human impact and natural disturbances'
Author: 'Robin L.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1433831904700670
Abstract: "AbstractLand-use history interacts with natural forces to influence the severity of disturbance events and the rate and nature of recovery processes in tropical forests. Although we are far from an integrated view of forest recovery processes, some generalizations can be made. Recovery of forest structure and composition is relatively rapid following disturbances that primarily impact forest canopies, such as hurricanes. Recovery is considerably slower following disturbances that heavily impact soils as well as aboveground vegetation, such as bulldozing, heavy or long-term grazing, and severe fires, often with long-lasting effects on species composition. The landscape matrix plays a critical role in local recovery processes. Proximity of disturbed areas to remnant forest patches promotes more rapid recovery, which depends heavily on seed dispersal. Recovery of aboveground biomass is constrained by soil fertility and texture across regions as well as across soil types within a region. Restoration of soil fertility may be a prerequisite for forest recovery on sites with severely degraded soils. Despite evidence of rapid forest recovery following large-scale deforestation, many degraded areas of today's tropics will require human assistance to recover forest structure, species composition, and species interactions typical of mature tropical forests."

Title: 'Study of Land use/land Cover Dynamics through Classification Algorithms for Harangi Catchment Area, Karnataka State, INDIA\xe2\x98\x86'

Abstract: "AbstractIndustrialization and urbanization are mainly responsible for the conversion of significant amount of vegetation rich lands such as forests and wetlands into agricultural lands and human settlements. This land use and land cover change in turn has influence on various hydrological processes such as soil erosion rate, sediment deposition in rivers and dams and also stream flow pattern in a catchment. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of Land use and Land cover (LU/LC) changes is necessary to assess the impacts of change in the pattern of natural vegetation on the earth's environment. Satellite images can provide useful information regarding spatial and temporal variation of LU/LC in an area. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the dynamics of LU/LC changes using LISS-III data for the years 2007, 2010 and 2013 of Harangi catchment, Coorg District, Karnataka State, India. Also, study compares three classification techniques such as Parallelepiped Algorithm, Minimum Distance to Mean Algorithm and Maximum Likelihood Algorithm based on the value of overall accuracy and kappa coefficient to check the reliability of the methods in classifying images. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient obtained by using Parellelepiped, Minimum distance to mean and Maximum likelihood algorithm for the year 2013 are 81.47% & 0.71, 78.67 & 0.68 and 89.36% & 0.81 respectively. Based on these results, it can be concluded that, among all the three techniques, the Maximum Likelihood Algorithm gave higher accuracy with high kappa coefficient and Minimum Distance to Mean Algorithm gave lower accuracy. The LU/LC change detection results between years 2007 and 2013 indicated a drastic change in forest area, plantation and waste land among all other classes. The forest area decreased dramatically from 183.12 sq. km to 131.02 sq. km. Also, fallow land and water body are decreased from 68.89 sq. km to 42.63 sq. km and 6.71 sq. km to 3.82 sq. km respectively. In contrast, the plantation and waterlogged area are observed to have an increasing trend of about 56.07 sq. km to 146.55 sq. km and 17.99 sq. km to 23.81 sq. km. The urban area has been increased from 13.06 sq. km to 13.72 sq. km. The urbanization and agricultural activities are the major reasons for increase in plantation and urban area in an expense of decrease in forest area."

The examined sections showed the following common anatomical characteristics. The pseudobulbs had a uniseriate epidermis. The assimilatory cells were scattered in the form of mucilage/water storage cells in the ground tissue. The vascular bundles were collateral and embedded in the ground tissue. Raphides occurred as idioblasts. Rhizomes had an uniseriate epidermis, parenchymatous ground tissue differentiated into outer and inner zones with polygonal intercellular spaces. Vascular bundles scattered, collateral and discontinuous form in both the taxa. Aeration cells were present in roots and rhizomes of M. acuminata. The transverse section of E. epidendraea roots had multi-layered velamen with spiral thickening followed by uniseriate exodermis with passage cells that had webbed tilosomes. The parenchymatous cortex contained raphides and water storage cells. Vascular bundles were 11\xe2\x80\x9315 arched. Roots of M. acuminata had an uniseriate velamen, exodermis, parenchymatous cortex, endodermis and pericycle. The vascular bundles were radially arranged, and 11\xe2\x80\x9312 arched. The xylem and phloem were embedded in sclerenchymatous tissue. The entry of the mycorrhizal fungi was chiefly through root hairs in roots and epidermis in rhizomes of M. acuminata, and in E. epidendraea. Fungi formed pelotons in both the taxa and microsclerotia and monilioid cells in the root cortex of E. epidendraea. Additionally, Glomus- type vesicles were occasionally present in the roots of M. acuminata. Description of characteristics arising from this investigation may provide additional morphological and anatomical means of identification.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Wood anatomical time series of Chukrasia tabularis were developed.\xe2\x80\xa2Vessel features were strongly connected to local climate.\xe2\x80\xa2Chukrasia vessels can be used for paleoclimatic and ecophysiological studies in moist tropical forests.AbstractWood anatomical features such as vessels record paleo climatic and environmental signals through their physiological adjustment during the environmental stress condition. Using vessel features as environmental proxy is relatively new in tropical dendrochronology but very useful to study plant ecophysiological responses to changing environmental conditions. Here, we developed the first vessel chronologies of diffuse porous Chukrasia tabularis from a Bangladeshi moist tropical forest and assessed their suitability for Dendroclimatic and ecophysiological studies in moist tropical forests. Standard chronologies of ring-width (RW), vessel number (NV), mean vessel area (MVA), total vessel area (TVA), total vessel area % (TVAP), mean vessel tangential diameter (MVTD), mean vessel radial diameter (MVRD), and vessel density (VD) were developed which spanned the period 1925\xe2\x80\x932015. Principal component analysis revealed that all chronologies were related among each other, the first two principal axis explaining 80% of the common variance. Hence, all chronologies shared a common environmental signal, except TVAP and MVRD which were excluded from further dendroclimatic analysis. Bootstrap correlation function was used to test the relationship between the chronologies and climate variables over 1950\xe2\x80\x932015. All chronologies were significantly correlated with monthly, seasonal and annual climate variables but varied in their magnitude. Spring temperatures (March\xe2\x80\x93April) and late monsoon precipitation had the dominant influence on the vessel features and radial growth of Chukrasia tabularis. Decreased vessel area (Hydraulic efficiency) and increased vessel density (Hydraulic safety) were observed in response to stress environmental condition particularly in the spring (hot and dry) when evapotranspiration became higher and soil moisture deficit occurs due to high temperatures. Moving correlation functions revealed stable climate tree-ring variable relationships during March\xe2\x80\x93April and October with an increasing tendency of climate interaction in other months. Our study shows that vessel features in Chukrasia tabularis are highly sensitive to inter-annual climate variability and can be used for paleoclimatic and ecophysiological studies in moist tropical forests.'

Title: 'Modern macaque dietary heterogeneity assessed using stable isotope analysis of hair and bone'
Author: 'Hannah J.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248408000912
Abstract: 'AbstractDietary variability might have been a major factor in the dispersal and subsequent persistence of the genus Macaca in both tropical and temperate areas. Macaques are found from northern Africa to Japan, yet there have been few systematic attempts to compare diets between different modern populations. Here we have taken a direct approach and sampled museum-curated tissues (hair and bone) of Macaca mulatta (rhesus macaques) for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope dietary analyses. Samples from India, Vietnam, and Burma (Myanmar) were taken, representing both tropical and temperate populations. The \xce\xb413C values obtained from hair show that the temperate macaques, particularly those from Uttar Pradesh, have a \xce\xb413C signature that indicates at least some use of C4 resources, while the tropical individuals have a C3-based diet. However, \xce\xb413C values from bone bioapatite indicate a C3-based diet for all specimens and they do not show the C4 usage seen in the hair of some animals, possibly because bone represents a much longer turnover period than that of hair. The results of \xce\xb415N analyses grouped animals by geographic region of origin, which may be related to local soil nitrogen values. The greatest variation in \xce\xb415N values was seen in the specimens from Burma, which may be partly due to seasonality, as specimens were collected at different times of year. We also investigated the relationship between the hair, bone collagen, and bone bioapatite \xce\xb413C results, and found that they are highly correlated, and that one tissue can be used to extrapolate results for another. However, our results also suggest that hair may pick up discrete feeding traces (such as seasonal usage), which are lost when only bone collagen and bioapatite are examined. This has important implications for dietary reconstructions of archaeological and paleontological populations.'

Abstract: 'AbstractMikania micrantha is a dangerous exotic weed now found throughout Guangdong Province, China. Introduced by the Indonesian Oil Palm Institute, lepidopteran defoliator Actinote thalia pyrrha (Fabricius) is a potential biological control factor for M. micrantha. Changes in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), polyphenoldoxidase (PPO), the total phenolics content, and the capacity of scavenging 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydazyl (DPPH\xc2\xb7) free radicals in M. micrantha leaves were analyzed after infestation by A. thalia pyrrha larvae. The results showed that a slight change of all the indexes in the damaged leaves appeared within 3 h. After four days of infestation by A. thalia pyrrha, SOD and POD activities in the damaged leaves were higher than those of the control. But CAT activity was lower than that of the control, indicating that the SOD and POD functions were impeded more than those of CAT. The SOD and POD activities reached their highest values after 48 h of infestation by A. thalia pyrrha and then decreased, whereas the highest activity of CAT occurred after 24 h and then decreased. PPO activity fluctuated greatly with its three peak values being 1.83, 1.92, and 2.17 times that of the control. The total phenolics content increased initially and then decreased after 72 h of infestation by A. thalia pyrrha. The capacity of scavenging DPPH\xc2\xb7 was significantly lower than that of the control (p<0.05). SOD activity positively correlated with CAT and POD activities for both damaged and normal leaves. However, the value of the correlation coefficient in the damaged leaves was higher than that in the normal leaves. The total phenolics content also showed a weak positive correlation with PPO activity. It is suggested that the protective response of M. micrantha to infestation by A. thalia pyrrha was short and limited, but resulted in a reduced function of the leaves, disturbed the metabolism in the protective enzyme system, and decreased the antioxidative capacity. M. micrantha was unable to resist the feeding stress by altering the content of the total phenolics.'

Abstract: 'AbstractTo what extent can private-sector bioprospecting incentives be relied upon for the protection of biological diversity? The literature contains dramatically different estimates of these incentives, from trivial to quite large. We resolve this controversy by isolating the fundamental source of the discrepancy and then providing empirically defensible estimates based on that analysis. Results demonstrate that the bioprospecting incentive is unlikely to generate much private-sector conservation. Thus, other mechanisms are likely required to preserve the public good of biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'AbstractWe present the first species-level molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for the Asian trogons, using DNA sequences of multiple mitochondrial and nuclear loci, and Bayesian and maximum likelihood tree reconstruction methods. The two genera of Asian trogons, Harpactes and Apalharpactes, are distantly related to each other. Within the widespread Southeast Asian genus Harpactes, we recovered three species groups: (1) H. oreskios; (2) H. orrhophaeus and H. duvaucelii; and (3) a clade of the seven large-bodied species. Short internal branch lengths link species in the large-bodied group, suggesting rapid diversification. Apalharpactes, which is currently restricted to the montane forests of Sumatra and Java, appears to be a relictual lineage distantly related to all other trogons. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses indicate Apalharpactes is sister to the African genus Apaloderma, although this result was not strongly supported. Overall, the extant Asian trogon species appear to have diversified prior to the Pleistocene, based on large pair-wise mitochondrial divergences between taxa.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image.Research highlights\xe2\x96\xba Apalharpactes is a relictual lineage distantly related to all other trogons. \xe2\x96\xba Asian trogons are most likely not a monophyletic group. \xe2\x96\xba Asian trogon species appear to have diversified prior to the Pleistocene.'

Abstract: 'Soil communities can have profound effects on invasions of ecosystems by exotic plant species. We propose that there are three main pathways by which this can happen. First, plant\xe2\x80\x93soil feedback interactions in the invaded range are neutral to positive, whereas native plants predominantly suffer from negative soil feedback effects. Second, exotic plants can manipulate local soil biota by enhancing pathogen levels or disrupting communities of root symbionts, while suffering less from this than native plants. Third, exotic plants produce allelochemicals toxic to native plants that cannot be detoxified by local soil communities, or that become more toxic following microbial conversion. We discuss the need for integrating these three pathways in order to further understand how soil communities influence exotic plant invasions.'

Title: 'Coastal ecosystem responses to late stage Deccan Trap volcanism: the post K\xe2\x80\x93T boundary (Danian) palynofacies of Mumbai (Bombay), west India'
Author: 'J.A.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018204005620
Abstract: "AbstractThe Deccan Trap continental flood basalt eruptions of India occurred c. 67\xe2\x80\x9363 Ma, thus spanning the Cretaceous\xe2\x80\x93Tertiary boundary (65 Ma). Deccan eruptions were coeval with an interval of profound global environmental and climatic changes and widespread extinctions, and this timing has sparked controversy regarding the relative influence of Deccan volcanism upon end-Cretaceous catastrophic events. If Deccan Trap activity was capable of affecting global ecosystems, evidence should be present in proximal Indian sedimentary facies and their palaeontological contents. The impact of late stage Deccan volcanism upon biota inhabiting Mumbai (Bombay) Island's post K\xe2\x80\x93T boundary lagoonal systems is documented here. Sediments (or \xe2\x80\x9cintertrappeans\xe2\x80\x9d) which accumulated within these lagoons are preserved between Trap lavas that characterise the closing stages of this flood basalt episode.Mumbai Island Formation intertrappean faunal and floral communities are conspicuously distinct from those common to many pre K\xe2\x80\x93T boundary, late Maastrichtian intertrappeans across the Deccan province. The latter sedimentary intercalations mostly developed in cognate semiarid, palustrine ecosystems; by contrast, those around Mumbai evolved in sheltered, peripheral marine settings, within subsiding continental margin basins unique to this late Deccan stage, and under an increasingly humid Danian climate. Geochemical analyses reveal that Mumbai sedimentation and diagenesis were intimately related to local explosive volcanic and regional intrusive activity at c. 65\xe2\x80\x9363 Ma. Although tectonic and igneous events imprinted their signatures throughout these sedimentary formations, organisms usually sensitive to environmental perturbations, including frogs and turtles, thrived. Critically, palynofacies data demonstrate that, whilst plant material deposition was responsive to environmental shifts, there were no palpable declines in floral productivity following Mumbai pyroclastic discharges. Therefore, it is implausible that this late stage explosive volcanism influenced major ecosystem collapses globally."

A mosaic of divergent reciprocations in resource relations were noticed due to livelihood transitions in the rural areas where previous resource uses and relations had been primarily within agriculture. The reconstitution of rural spaces and the attendant changes in the resource equations are observed to be creating new sites of conformity, contestation and conflicts that often move beyond local spaces. This paper critically reviews studies across the Global South to explore the nature and extent of changes in resource relations and agricultural landscapes post livelihood diversification and the implication and challenges of these changes for natural resource governance. Though there is drastic reduction in agricultural livelihoods throughout the Global South, changes in agricultural area are found to be inconsistent and heterogeneous in the region. Agriculture continues in the countrysides but in widely differentiated capacities and redefined value systems. The transformed agrarian spaces are characterized by a mosaic of scenarios from persistence and sustainable subsistence to differentiation and exploitative commercial practices to abandonment and speculation. The reconfigured resource relations, emergent multiple and multi-scalar interest groups, institutional and policy changes and altered power differentials in these diversified landscapes are yet to be incorporated into natural resource governance frameworks such as IRBM.'

Title: 'Floristic zonation of tree communities on wet tropical mountains revisited'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe altitudes of the ecotones between the main vegetation-zones up mountains of the humid tropics are reviewed, with emphasis on floristics and those areas with which the author is personally familiar. A detailed comparison is made of the zonation on Mt Kinabalu (c. 6\xc2\xb0N) and the Himalaya of Bhutan (c. 27\xc2\xb0N), and is supported by information from other parts of SE Asia, and to a decreasing extent South America and Africa. The relationship between forest-types based on structure and physiognomy and forest-types based on floristics is complicated. In SE Asia lower montane forests may be dominated by dipterocarps or an \xe2\x80\x98oak-laurel\xe2\x80\x99 assemblage. The dominant leaf size in both is notophyll, but the oak-laurel assemblage shifts to the microphyll size-class in China where the transition from tropical lower montane to warm temperate lowland forest begins. The opposite trend is seen where the lower montane flora of Papua New Guinea corresponds to the lowland flora in NE Australia. There are only modest changes between the Equator and the Tropic in the altitudes at which major transitions occur. It is concluded that soil changes, mediated only in part by temperature and associated climatic factors, may play a more direct and diverse role than has previously been indicated. The soil factors emphasized are the increase in organic matter content in lower montane soils as opposed to lowland, accompanied by a change from termite-dominance to earthworm-dominance, and the frequent occurrence of a dense moss layer and mor humus in upper montane soils. The case is made particularly by reference to east Asian mountains, which have been the most studied.'

The present article provides the first overview of non-fuel mining conflicts in India. The analysis is based on 100 cases of conflicts that occurred between 1992 and 2014, which constitutes the most exhaustive database compiled to date. In each case, location, mineral extracted, actors involved, cited causes of protest, conflict duration and outcomes were recorded. We found that the commodity responsible for the most conflicts is sand, the extraction of which is widespread and often carried out illegally by small-scale actors near rivers. Resistance against metallic ore mining, in contrast, typically pits local populations against larger corporations. Most resistance movements are composed of subaltern rural and/or indigenous populations; very few national and international NGOs were found to be involved in local movements. The causes of such conflicts have largely been ecological and responsible for an undermining of local livelihoods. Mineral extraction is expected to increase in India over the next decade, and with it, the number of associated conflicts.'

Title: 'Soil respiration and microbial population in a tropical deciduous forest soil of Orissa, India'
Author: 'Raj Ballav'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0367253011001253
Abstract: 'AbstractAn investigation was carried out to estimate soil respiration rate and its relationship with microbial population in natural tropical forest soil, deforested soil and deforested-and-cultivated soil of Orissa, India. Soil respiration measurements and microbial isolation were performed following standard procedures. Monthly variation of soil respiration was observed to be governed by soil moisture. Considering respiration as a function of microbial population a regression analysis was made. The microfungal population showed positive relationship with the rate of soil respiration. The study revealed that conversion of natural forest led to a reduction of soil microbes and rate of soil respiration. Considering the importance of the microbial component in soil, we conclude that the conversion of natural forests to different land uses leads to the loss of biological stability of the soil.'

They store more than 80% of their produce in their households for consumption. The present study examines the grain storage practices followed by Soligas and the extent of losses incurred by them, in a traditional agricultural setup. In all, 13 different storage structures used by Soligas were recorded. These included both traditional and modern structures. Among these, plastic oven sac was being used most widely, while Thenemane used for storing maize cobs was the least used structure by the Soligas. An evaluation of these storage structures for safe storage of grains revealed that, none of the traditional storage structures were found to be suitable for grain storage, as they had one or the other disadvantages like, not being moisture or insect or rodent proof. However, the modern structures like, the plastic bins were moisture and rodent proof, but they failed to provide protection against insects. Soligas adopted 10 different grain protection methods for safe storage of grains. Despite their use, the presence of insect infestation ranged from 32.14 to 56.41%. Callosobruchus theobromae was the most common stored grain insect found infesting fieldbean (Dolichos bean) that was stored in most of the settlements, while Tribolium castaneum was the rarest, found infesting only split pigeon pea (Cajanus cajana). The extent of grain damage ranged from 10 to 100% in the samples collected.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (211KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Workers of the Indian jumping ant bite larvae to inhibit queen development.\xe2\x80\xa2Biting can be elicited by transferring queen cuticular compounds to worker larvae.\xe2\x80\xa2Queen larvae have a greater proportion of short-chained compounds on their cuticle.\xe2\x80\xa2These short-chained cuticular compounds may serve as a \xe2\x80\x98princess pheromone\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\xa2Princess pheromone production is linked to increased juvenile hormone (JH) levels.Numerous studies have identified cuticular compounds that distinguish adult queens from workers in social insect colonies, but how future queens are identified at the larval stage is poorly understood. Nevertheless, the ability of workers to discriminate queen and worker larvae is necessary for them to regulate caste determination and queen production. In the ant Harpegnathos saltator, workers bite larvae to inhibit queen development, and we used biting as an assay to test how workers identify queens at the larval stage. The transfer of cuticular compounds from queen to worker larvae through direct physical contact (rubbing) or using a hexane extract both elicited biting. Gas chromatography revealed significant differences in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of queen and worker larvae that could be induced by treatment with a juvenile hormone (JH) analogue. Finally, treatment of male larvae with a JH analogue also elicited worker biting, which suggests a direct connection between JH levels and the production of a larval queen signal. These results demonstrate that workers identify larval caste using a chemical signal present on the cuticle, a \xe2\x80\x98princess pheromone\xe2\x80\x99, that reflects endocrine changes associated with queen development. Based on the connection between JH levels and the production of a larval queen signal, we developed a model for caste determination in H.\xc2\xa0saltator that incorporates endocrine, pheromonal and behavioural control of caste development.'

Abstract: 'AbstractGas hydrate resource assessments that indicate enormous global volumes of gas present within hydrate accumulations have been one of the primary driving forces behind the growing interest in gas hydrates. Gas hydrate volumetric estimates in recent years have focused on documenting the geologic parameters in the \xe2\x80\x9cgas hydrate petroleum system\xe2\x80\x9d that control the occurrence of gas hydrates in nature. The primary goals of this report are to review our present understanding of the geologic controls on the occurrence of gas hydrate in the offshore of India and to document the application of the petroleum system approach to the study of gas hydrates.National Gas Hydrate Program of India executed the National Gas Hydrate Program Expedition 01 (NGHP-01) in 2006 in four areas located on the eastern and western margins of the Indian Peninsula and in the Andaman Sea. These areas have experienced very different tectonic and depositional histories. The peninsular margins are passive continental margins resulting from a series of rifting episodes during the breakup and dispersion of Gondwanaland to form the present Indian Ocean. The Andaman Sea is bounded on its western side by a convergent margin where the Indian plate lithosphere is being subducted beneath southeast Asia.NGHP-01 drilled, logged, and/or cored 15 sites (31 holes) in the Krishna\xe2\x80\x93Godavari Basin, 4 sites (5 holes) in the Mahanadi Basin, 1 site (2 holes) in the Andaman Sea, and 1 site (1 hole) in the Kerala\xe2\x80\x93Konkan Basin. Holes were drilled using standard drilling methods for the purpose of logging-while-drilling and dedicated wireline logging; as well as through the use of a variety of standard coring systems and specialized pressure coring systems.NGHP-01 yielded evidence of gas hydrate from downhole log and core data obtained from all the sites in the Krishna\xe2\x80\x93Godavari Basin, the Mahanadi Basin, and in the Andaman Sea. The site drilled in the Kerala\xe2\x80\x93Konkan Basin during NGHP-01 did not yield any evidence of gas hydrate. Most of the downhole log-inferred gas hydrate and core-recovered gas hydrate were characterized as either fracture-filling in clay-dominated sediments or as pore-filling or grain-displacement particles disseminated in both fine- and coarse-grained sediments. Geochemical analyses of gases obtained from sediment cores recovered during NGHP-01 indicated that the gas in most all of the hydrates in the offshore of India is derived from microbial sources; only one site in the Andaman Sea exhibited limited evidence of a thermogenic gas source. The gas hydrate petroleum system concept has been used to effectively characterize the geologic controls on the occurrence of gas hydrates in the offshore of India.'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Indian tropical deciduous forest due to higher species richness, microclimate offers dynamism in spatial patterns of aboveground biomass (AGB).\xe2\x80\xa2Strong positive correlation was observed between litter fall and AGB in three plant functional types (dry mixed, sal mixed and teak plantation).\xe2\x80\xa2Humidity and air temperature were the major microclimatic variables supporting higher AGB as observed in principal component analysis.AbstractIndian tropical deciduous forest due to higher species richness, irregular stem densities and stem cover, multistoried canopy and microclimate, offers dynamism to the understanding of the spatial patters in aboveground biomass (AGB) and carbon (AGBC) within different plant functional types (PFTs). Field-based AGB and AGBC estimates are vital for carbon cycle study and provide inputs for data-deficit regional and global carbon and climate models.In this paper we generated the primary baseline data on tree composition, species richness (SR), AGB and AGBC gathered from nine 10,000\xc2\xa0m2 long-term ecological research (LTER) plots in three distinct PFTs {dry mixed (DM), sal mixed (SM) and teak plantation (TP)} within an Indian tropical deciduous forest along Himalayan foothills during 2009\xe2\x80\x932012. The functional relationship of PFT structural attributes i.e. SR, density, basal cover, leaf area index and litter fall on AGB was investigated. PCA was applied to study the relationship between PFT microclimate, structural attributes and diversity vs. AGB.A total of 22, 22 and 6 tree species were found in DM, SM and TP PFT, respectively. Shannon's diversity index was highest (2.46) in DM, whereas Simpson's dominance index was maximum (0.85) in TP. AGB (Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) ranged from 290.82\xe2\x80\x93455.99 among all PFTs.

AGB observed strong positive correlation with tree density and cover. PCA revealed humidity and air temperature as the major microclimatic variables, leading to higher AGB."

The size of 99% of forest fires was less than 100\xc2\xa0ha, and the average annual burned area was 124,192\xc2\xa0ha. Most of the forest fires occurred in the spring (accounting for 83%), with March having the highest rate (60.0%). Forest fires were mainly distributed in the south and southwest regions of China. In total, 72.2% of the forest fires occurred in humid region of the medium temperate zone, and 54% occurred in regions with altitudes lower than 500\xc2\xa0m.

Title: 'Joint forest management in India: Experiences of two decades'
Author: 'Prodyut'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344909002274
Abstract: "AbstractJoint Forest Management (JFM), embracing the philosophy of forest conservation and livelihood improvement through cooperation between state and civil society, has emerged over the past decades both as a specific paradigm of forest governance in India and as India's largest community forestry program. The JFM program, evolved during early 1970s covering a few forest villages as a model for reversing the trend of degraded forest ecosystem through the active protection by local villagers. The JFM program is implemented currently by 106,482 Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMC) and it covers 22 million ha of forests spread across 28 constituent states of India and union territories.JFM emerged against a backdrop of two centuries of centralised bureaucratic control over forest management in India. Centralized control during the 19th and 20th centuries failed either to conserve resources or to contribute substantially to the well-being of local populations. However, inconsistent persuasions from decentralization policies in India under present forest policy (1988) have prompted people to analyse the theoretical basis for accepting that decentralization would bring improvements in forest ecosystem management. Still others have contested the de facto rationale for decentralization (i.e., improved forest management) and have suggested that decentralization may be a manipulation by elites to serve their own interests or to shift power, for example from national to international agencies that have funded decentralization. Thirty years from its inception, there are now concerns for the recent effectiveness of JFM (over the past 20 years) because it is a group action that is getting old and is perhaps losing some of its pioneering drive and innovativeness.Although JFM has been administered nationally, decisions on implementation detail have been left to the individual states, resulting in different strategies. The long history of JFM has also provided scope for experiences with it to change over time as well as between places.Given the range of experiences with and perceptions of JFM, as well as the importance of the objectives JFM ostensibly serves, the time is ripe therefore for a retrospective evaluation to take stock of its actual achievements, its status and ways forward. The current paper seeks to provide such a review and analysis.The paper highlights design and implementation issues related to government resolutions, benefits-sharing and forest offences. It also assesses the critical design factors and key drivers responsible for institutional reforms. The paper evaluates impacts of protection on forest productivity and on the livelihoods of local communities. It highlights that the JFM program, by virtue of the diversity of its implementation, provides an ideal laboratory for exploring why similar reforms can lead to different outcomes. The paper argued that though there are supporting government policy and guideline and massive fund support, why there has been a low down of enthusiasm for JFM in the last two decades. From experiences, it suggests strategies for its revival and JFM can further contribute effective toward forest conservation and enhanced livelihood opportunities in the future."

Decision-making documents in the Supreme Court and in one specific case of a bauxite mining conflict involving Vedanta in the Niyamgiri hills are studied to come to conclusions about how economic valuation of forests has moved through the political process. We argue that establishing NPV for forests is neither conducive to conservation nor to environmental justice for the following three reasons. The technical and political process of setting prices deepens and reproduces structural inequalities with negative distributive effects. NPV encourages economistic decision-making procedures that exclude participation. Finally NPV does not recognize or take into account cultural difference or plural values. We thus conclude that economic valuation of forest products and services has not managed to \xe2\x80\x9csave\xe2\x80\x9d forests in India and is not an effective or viable strategy for expressing the value of forests or for environmental conservation and environmental justice activism.'

Title: 'Can local use assist in controlling invasive alien species in tropical forests? The case of Lantana camara in southern India'
Author: 'Ramesh'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112716303139
Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We considered the use of the invasive Lantana camara as an opportunity for control.\xe2\x80\xa2Forest inventory showed reduced density of Lantana plants in harvested sites.\xe2\x80\xa2Season of cutting and stem cut influenced the extent of regrowth and mortality.\xe2\x80\xa2Harvesting may check Lantana at the local scale, but not at a landscape scale.AbstractMany invasive alien species (IAS) are used by local communities for a variety of subsistence and income generating purposes. This frequently poses a conflict of interest for their removal due to forest conservation and biodiversity concerns. However, if local use can simultaneously check or control specific IAS, the conflict can be avoided and both development and forest conservation perspectives accommodated in the short to medium term. We examine this for Lantana camara invasion in southern India through assessment of the demand for and impacts of harvesting on this globally problematic IAS. We interviewed local artisans regarding their knowledge and quantities of Lantana used, along with forest surveys to estimate Lantana densities and size classes in harvested and unharvested sites, and lastly we undertook controlled cutting in moist and dry deciduous forests in both the wet and dry seasons to examine rate of regrowth and mortality. Over the entire study area the abundance of Lantana far outweighed local demand, but at small scales around villages, density and size classes were significantly reduced through harvesting. The controlled cutting experiment showed marked seasonal differences, with the most severe cutting intensity resulting in significant mortality when Lantana plants were cut in the wet season, but with limited effect when cut in the dry season. We conclude that promoting local use of IAS may be a feasible approach in controlling them and thereby limiting their impacts in forests.'

Title: 'Die Schildbl\xc3\xa4ttrigkeit krautiger Angiospermen-Sippen in ihrer Beziehung zu Standort und Verbreitung1)The leaf peltation in the herbaceous taxa of Angiosperms in its relation to natural habitat and distribution'
Author: 'Friedrich'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0367253017308411
Abstract: 'SummaryThis study is an attempt to analyse the leaf peltation principally amongst herbaceous plants in its relation to natural habitat anddistribution, and concurrently to investigate their connection with certain growth forms and family groupings.The results confirm that in herbaceous plants peltation occurs predominantly amongst perennials with adventitious roots, that is to say amongst growth forms possessing rhizomes, creeping shoots, bulbs, tubers and stolons with stem tubers. Peltation was only marginally established amongst the phylogenetically young annuals which prefer dry growing conditions.Oceanity has a clear influence upon the distribution of peltate taxa. The majority of peltate perennials are associated with the OZ1\xe2\x80\x933 degrees of oceanity. In subtropical, meridional and temperate steppes, deserts, and semi-deserts, peltation declines dramatically. The influence of zonality upon the distribution of peltate taxa is limited. In subtropical, meridional and temperate areas of N. America (including Central America) and East Asia, the proportion of peltate genera within the total genera stock of one region is relatively constant. This proportion declines in the boreal zone and peltate taxa are absent in the arctic zone.Almost all peltate perennials colonise wet, damp or humid locations, or sites with variable wetness and humidity. They favour lakes, ponds, swamps, moors, meadows, damp sand, stream and riverbanks, woods and damp shaded or half-shaded rocks. The ascidiate groups of plants resemble peltate species in their preference for wet, damp and humid habitats. Their leaf type is also related to the peltate one.The more or less frequent appearence of peltate taxa within the taxonomic sphere of the ascidiate families (Nepenthaceae, Sarraceniaceae) and genera (Utricularia, Genlisea) may indicate familial relationships. This should be borne in mind in phylogenetic studies of carnivors. Questions relating to the evolution of some succulent peltate plant groups are also discussed.'

Abstract: 'AbstractGrewia tiliaefolia is widely used in traditional Indian medicines to cure jaundice, biliousness, dysentery and the diseases of blood. Bioassay-guided fractionation of methanolic extract of the G. tiliaefolia bark has resulted in the isolation of D-erythro-2-hexenoic acid \xce\xb3-lactone (EHGL) and gulonic acid \xce\xb3-lactone (GAGL). Hepatoprotective activity of the methanolic extract and the isolated constituents were evaluated against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. The treatment with methanolic extract, EHGL and GAGL at oral doses of 100, 150 and 60\xc2\xa0mg/kg respectively with concomitant CCl4 intraperitoneal injection (1\xc2\xa0ml/kg) significantly reduced the elevated plasma levels of aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase and the incidence of liver necrosis compared with the CCl4-injected group without affecting the concentrations of serum bilirubin and hepatic markers. EHGL and GAGL significantly inhibited the elevated levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and glutathione in liver homogenates. Histology of the liver tissues of the extract and isolated constituents treated groups showed the presence of normal hepatic cords, absence of necrosis and fatty infiltration as similar to the normal control. The results revealed that the hepatoprotective activity of EHGL is significant as similar to the standard drug silymarin. To clarify the influence of the extract and isolated constituents on the protection of oxidative-hepatic damage, we examined in vitro antioxidant properties of the test compounds. The extract and the constituents showed significant free radical scavenging activity. These results suggest that the extract as well as the constituents could protect the hepatocytes from CCl4-induced liver damage perhaps, by their anti-oxidative effect on hepatocytes, hence eliminating the deleterious effects of toxic metabolites from CCl4.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Agricultural zoning can mitigate the impacts of biofuels crops expansion.\xe2\x80\xa2Wildlife-friendly techniques can improve biodiversity in biofuels crops dominated landscapes.\xe2\x80\xa2Long-term biodiversity monitoring programs should include agricultural landscapes.AbstractThe use of biofuels can result on a decrease of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when compared to fossil fuels. However, the expansion of biofuels crops has been either based on direct or indirect displacement of natural ecosystems or on the use of degraded or marginal lands. The former results in direct habitat loss, whereas the later results in usual agricultural impacts (e.g., soil and biotic contamination and water eutrophication). However, in some circumstances biofuels crops can result on an increase in biodiversity compared to other agricultural crops. Agricultural zoning can mitigate the impacts of land use change (LUC), either direct (dLUC) or indirect (iLUC), whereas the use of wildlife-friendly techniques can mitigate the impacts of agriculture intensification. However, in both cases long-term biodiversity monitoring programs should be established in order to help the decision making process concerning the conflict between the expansion of biofuels crops and the conservation of biodiversity.'

Title: "RESEARCH PAPERTime budget of daily activity of Francois' langur (Trachypithecus francoisi francoisi) in disturbance habitat"
Author: 'Luo'

Abstract: "AbstractThe daily activity pattern of wild Francois' langurs (Trachypithecus francoisi francisi) was observed in disturbed habitat at Mayanghe National Nature Reserve of Guizhou Province, China, between 1999 and 2000. The behaviors of wild adult Francois' langurs were recorded at a 5-min interval using an instantaneous sampling method. The results indicate that resting, foraging, traveling, huddling, playing and grooming activities account for 35.41%, 31.67%, 14.44%, 9.61%, 8.54% and 0.33%, respectively, in the daily time budget of these adult Francois' langurs during the study period. In comparison with the results in undisturbed habitat, the decreased food availability in disturbed habitat changes the foraging behavior of langurs, and also changes time budgets of other behaviors, such as the increase of the proportion of traveling and the decrease of the proportion of resting. At the same time, the higher frequency of human activity in the disturbed habitat influences the time budget of daily social behavior of the langurs including playing, huddling and grooming. The patterns of activity rhythms of wild adult Francois' langurs in the disturbed habitat show some seasonal differences which are also discussed."

Title: 'Beyond the water column: aquatic hyphomycetes outside their preferred habitat'
Author: 'Eric'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1754504815000689
Abstract: 'AbstractAquatic hyphomycetes have adapted to running waters by their uncommon conidial shape, which facilitates dispersal as well as adherence to plant substrata. However, they have been early and regularly reported to occur in a variety of environments other than their preferred habitat (e.g., in lentic freshwaters, brackish and marine environments, in terrestrial niches such as stream banks, dew, canopy waters and tree holes). In addition, several aquatic hyphomycetes have adapted to a mutualistic lifestyle which may involve plant defence, as endophytes in leaves, gymnosperm needles, orchids and terrestrial roots. There are several lines of evidence suggesting that aquatic hyphomycetes survive under terrestrial conditions due to their sexual states. Although exhibiting higher diversity in pristine streams, aquatic hyphomycetes can survive environmental stress, e.g., pollution or river intermittency. They also inhabit ground and hyporheic waters, where they appear to be subjected to both physical and physiological selection. Appropriate methods including molecular ones should provide a more comprehensive view of the occurrence and ecological roles of aquatic hyphomycetes outside their preferred habitat.'

Title: 'Molecular phylogeny of the cyprinid tribe Labeonini (Teleostei: Cypriniformes)'
Author: 'Lei'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790312002217
Abstract: 'AbstractThe cyprinid tribe Labeonini (sensuRainboth, 1991) is a large group of freshwater fishes containing around 40 genera and 400 species. They are characterized by an amazing diversity of modifications to their lips and associated structures. In this study, a total of 34 genera and 142 species of putative members of this tribe, which represent most of the generic diversity and more than one third of the species diversity of the group, were sampled and sequenced for four nuclear genes and five mitochondrial genes (totaling 9465\xc2\xa0bp). Phylogenetic relationships and subdivision of this tribe were investigated and the placement and status of most genera are discussed. Partitioned maximum likelihood analyses were performed based on the nuclear dataset, mitochondrial dataset, combined dataset, and the dataset for each nuclear gene. Inclusion of the genera Paracrossochilus, Barbichthys, Thynnichthys, and Linichthys in the Labeonini was either confirmed or proposed for the first time. None of the genera Labeo, Garra, Bangana, Cirrhinus, and Crossocheilus are monophyletic. Taxonomic revisions of some genera were made: the generic names Gymnostomus Heckel, 1843, Ageneiogarra Garman, 1912 and Gonorhynchus McClelland, 1839 were revalidated; Akrokolioplax Zhang and Kottelat, 2006 becomes a junior synonym of Gonorhynchus; the species Osteochilus nashii was found to be a member of the barbin genus Osteochilichthys. Five historical hypotheses on the classification of the Labeonini were tested and rejected. We proposed to subdivide the tribe, which is strongly supported as monophyletic, into four subtribes: Labeoina, Garraina, Osteochilina, and Semilabeoina. The taxa included in each subtribe were listed and those taxa that need taxonomic revision were discussed.Graphical abstractDownload full-size imageHighlights\xe2\x96\xba Most genera and more than 1/3 of species of the tribe Labeonini were sampled. \xe2\x96\xba Five mitochondrial and four nuclear genes were sequenced. \xe2\x96\xba With type species of Garra, Labeo, etc., an extensive taxonomic revision was made. \xe2\x96\xba Labeonini was subdivided into: Labeoina, Garraina, Osteochilina, Semilabeoina. \xe2\x96\xba Lips and associated structures should only be used for alpha taxonomy.'

Title: 'Hydroelectric resource assessment in Uttara Kannada District, Karnataka State, India'
Author: 'T.V.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652698000766
Abstract: "AbstractThe amount of power available at a given site is decided by the volumetric flow of water and the hydraulic head or water pressure. In hydro schemes, the turbines that drive the electricity generators are directly powered either from a reservoir or the `run of the river'. The large schemes may include a water storage reservoir providing daily or seasonal storage to match the production with demand for electricity. These schemes have been producing power in Karnataka for many years, with the first hydroelectric station built in 1942. The majority of them are in Uttara Kannada district. Due to environmental constraints, further construction of storage reservoirs is limited and attention has been focussed towards developing environmental friendly small-scale hydro schemes to cater for the needs of the region. In this paper, the assessment of potential carried out in the streams of Bedthi and Aghnashini river basins in Uttara Kannada district of Western Ghats is discussed. Potentials at five feasible sites are assessed based on stream gauging carried out for a period of 18 months. Computations of discharge on empirical/rational method based on 90 years of precipitation data and the subsequent power and energy values computed are in conformity with the power calculations based on stream gauging. It is estimated that, if all streams are harnessed for energy, electricity generated would be in the order of 720 and 510 million units in Bedthi and Aghnashini basins, respectively. This exercise provides insight to meeting the regional energy requirement through integrated approaches, like harnessing hydro power in a decentralized way during the monsoon season, and meeting lean season requirements through small storage, solar or other thermal options. Net energy analyses incorporating biomass energy lost in submergence show that maximization in net energy at a site is possible, if the hydroelectric generation capacity is adjusted according to the seasonal variations in the river's water discharge."

Title: 'Characterization and crop production efficiency of diazotrophic isolates from the rhizosphere of semi-arid tropical grasses of India'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We isolated the plant growth promoting of diazotrophs from rhizosphere of semi-arid tropical grasses.\xe2\x80\xa2Isolates belong to be members of alpha Proteobacteria and Firmicutes.\xe2\x80\xa2The isolates were found to produce phytohormone, siderophores, HCN, solubilize minerals such as P, K, Zn and synthesize enzymes such as ACC deaminase that can modulate plant growth and development.\xe2\x80\xa2Microbial inoculants prepared by out of these diazotrophic isolates increased grain and straw yields of rice.AbstractThe search for diverse plant growth-promoting diazotrophic bacteria is gaining momentum as efforts are made to exploit them as bioinoculants for various crops. In particular, the use of strains with multiple plant growth promoting properties would help to increase crop productivity on a sustainable basis. This study investigated the effects of plant growth promoting potential of diazotrophs isolated from rhizosphere of semi-arid tropical grasses and evaluated their inoculation effects on the growth of rice plants under in vitro and in vivo conditions. The diazotrophic isolates from grass species were characterized for nitrogenase activity by acetylene reduction assay (ARA) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The ARA activity of the isolates ranged from 50.83 to 172.25\xc2\xa0nmol\xc2\xa0ethylene/mg\xc2\xa0protein/h and the putative diazotrophs from rhizosphere of grass species were identified by nifH gene amplification. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis identified the isolates as belonging to class of alpha Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Plant growth promoting traits of all the selected diazotrophic isolates were analysed and results revealed that the diazotrophs were found to produce phytohormone, siderophores, HCN, solubilized minerals such as P, K and Zn. Diazotrophs also produced enzyme such as ACC deaminase that can modulate plant growth and development. Based on the presence of multiple plant growth promoting traits, the isolates were selected for inoculation studies. In gnotobiotic experiment, inoculation of diazotrophic isolates significantly improves the growth of rice. In the field experiment, Serratia sp. (CB2) and K. pneumoniae (CR3) treated plots, grain yields were recorded more by 31 and 28%, respectively, over yield obtained using full doses of fertilizers. This trait of improving growth parameters and yield of rice indicates that the diazotrophs isolated from grass species can be utilized as bioinoculant for rice.'

Title: 'Diffuse agricultural water pollution in India'
Author: 'G.D.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027312239900030X
Abstract: 'AbstractConcern over agricultural diffuse pollution sources in integrated water quality management has been growing recently. Such sources are likely to be even more critical in developing countries, including India, where agriculture and rural habitats are still dominant, unlike the G7 or other affluent industrialised nations. A number of special features of the Indian scene need to be considered. These include: (i) extremely varying rainfall and stream-flow patterns; (ii) still largely traditional agricultural practices with average application of fertilizers and pesticides and significant areas under dry farming or only marginal irrigation; (iii) a very large cattle population, with agriculture almost always linked with animal husbandry; (iv) a culture of living close to the river (if not in the river) with dominating instream uses of bathing, washing, cattle wading, waste disposal, etc. and large-scale floodplain farming; and (v) scant respect for rules, regulations and laws alongside an extremely weak law-enforcement machinery.The paper shows that in the non-monsoon (non-flood) periods, which may account for all but 2 months of a year, agricultural diffuse pollution sources seem to have no impact on stream water quality. During these periods flows are low to minimal and pollution is dominated by the in-stream uses, sullage waters of rural communities and point discharges from urban/industrial sources, if any. Pollution due to agricultural return waters, either as wash-off or as seepage, appears to be rare during the 8\xe2\x80\x9310 fair weather months. However, surface wash-off of pollutants from agricultural sources becomes the dominant factor during flood flows, and seepage/drainage from agricultural fields/soils continues to pollute streams for a month or two after the monsoons are over.Application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides (or any other agricultural chemicals) in India is still low compared to developed countries, and while eutrophication due to high levels of washed-off nutrients is observed in rural ponds and other stagnant bodies of water receiving agricultural drainage, and excessive pesticide residuals are often reported for vegetables, fodder, milk, etc., monitoring of streams and rivers does not show any significant pollution due to nutrients or pesticides from agricultural diffuse pollution during fair weather months. High nitrate concentrations have been reported in groundwater and in many areas, such as Punjab and Haryana, these can often be linked directly to diffuse agricultural sources. The major problem of agricultural diffuse pollution appears to be the heavy silt loads, along with large quantities of dissolved salts, nutrients, organics and even heavy metals and bacterial contaminants washed off during floods. The silt tends to clog up the flow channel to further encourage seasonal floodplain agriculture. This results in a vicious circle, which degrades the channel, increases flood-damage and is undesirable from ecological and sustainability points of view. High concentrations of salts and nutrients encourage growth of weeds and macrophytes after the floods have passed. The presence of organics, heavy metals and bacterial contamination renders the streamwater unfit for in-stream use or abstraction.With the introduction of intensive agriculture and adoption of modern farming techniques involving the application of much irrigation water and agricultural chemicals, the problems caused by diffuse agricultural pollution are bound to grow. Routine pollution control methods of discharge permits (or consent letters), EIAs or environmental audits, and normal enforcement measures by regulatory agencies are not likely to work for control of such pollution. Using the example of a small river in central India, Paisuni (Mandakini), the paper brings out the nature of the problems, and suggests a possible management approach.'

Title: 'Forum communicationConsequences of sea level and climate changes on the morphodynamics of a tropical coastal lagoon during Holocene: An evolutionary model'
Author: 'D.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618213009440
Abstract: 'AbstractVembanad Lagoon is the largest backwater system in the southwestern coast of India, and it is one of the wetlands of international importance, as defined by the Ramsar Convention. The coastal area encompassing the Vembanad Lagoon comprises a spectrum of barrier islands, ridges and swales, lagoons, and flood plains. The lagoon and its adjoining coastal lands are known for economically viable deposits of ilmenite rich beach placers, lime shells, and high purity silica sands. The sedimentological, palynological, and geochronological studies reveal that the sea level and climate changes have brought significant modifications in the geomorphic settings of the system. The depositional regimes and the evolutionary phases showed marked differences in the northern and southern reaches of the Lagoon. The geomorphological settings, occurrence of a suite of major heavy minerals (sillimanite\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0opaque) and predominance of marine elements in the palynological assemblage in the southern reach of the lagoon are indicative of barrier spit development, which is further influenced by reworked Neogene sediments with characteristic sillimanite\xe2\x80\x93opaque heavy mineral suite of khondalitic affinity. The northern half evolved during the transgressive\xe2\x80\x93regressive events of Early\xe2\x80\x93Middle Holocene from a sheltered coastal water body surrounded by thick coastal vegetation. The opaque\xe2\x80\x93inosilicate dominant heavy mineral suite in the northern sector indicates contribution of sediments from charnokitic source rocks in the area north of the Achankovil Shear Zone. The proposed four stage evolutionary model of the Vembanad Lagoon indicates that it evolved from an embayment of the Arabian Sea by the progradation and development of a barrier spit during transgressive\xe2\x80\x93regressive cycles under heavy rainfall events of the Holocene.'

Title: 'PEDOSPHERELeaf and Ecosystem Gas Exchange Responses of Buffel Grass-Dominated Grassland to Summer Precipitation'
Author: 'Mir Zaman'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1002016014600813
Abstract: 'ABSTRACTSporadic rain events that occur during summer play an important role in the initiation of biological activity of semi-arid grasslands. To understand how ecosystem processes of a buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.)-dominated grassland respond to summer rain events, an LI 6 400 gas exchange system was used to measure the leaf gas exchange and plant canopy chambers were used to measure net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and ecosystem respiration (Reco), which were made sequentially during periods before rain (dry) and after rain (wet). Gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) was estimated from NEE and Reco fluxes, and light use efficiency parameters were estimated using a rectangular hyperbola model. Prior to the monsoon rain, grassland biomass was non-green and dry exhibiting positive NEE (carbon source) and low GEP values during which the soil water became increasingly scarce. An initial rain pulse (60 mm) increased the NEE from pre-monsoon levels to negative NEE (carbon gain) with markedly higher GEP and increased green biomass. The leaf photosynthesis and leaf stomatal conductance were also improved substantially. The maximum net CO2 uptake (i.e., negative NEE) was sustained in the subsequent period due to multiple rain events. As a result, the grassland acted as a net carbon sink for 20 d after first rain. With cessation of rain (drying cycle), net CO2 uptake was reduced to lower values. High sensitivity of this grassland to rain suggests that any decrease in precipitation in summer may likely affect the carbon sequestration of the semiarid ecosystem.'

This review provides a comprehensive summary of issues surrounding Indus dolphin conservation, and includes a description of their distribution, the threats they face and a discussion of conservation and research activities, options and priorities. Information was gathered from published current and historical literature, newspaper articles, and unpublished reports. Prior to construction of the Indus Irrigation system dolphins occurred in 3500\xc2\xa0km of the Indus River system. Their range has now declined by 80% due to fragmentation of river habitat by barrages and large-scale diversion of water for irrigated agriculture. The subspecies was estimated to number approximately 1450 individuals in 2011, and occurs in 6 subpopulations, three of which are probably too small to persist. There is an urgent need to evaluate whether dolphins move through barrages, as this has the potential to extirpate upstream subpopulations. Pre-requisites for dolphin translocations to combat this problem are outlined. Mortality in fishing gear and high levels of chemical pollution in water courses are both increasing threats exacerbated by depleted flows. Research and conservation priorities include maintenance of river flows, mortality monitoring, canal rescues and community-based conservation. Conservation and research action is urgently needed to prevent the Indus dolphin from succumbing to the same fate as the baiji.'

Abstract: 'AbstractGlobal and regional species conservation efforts are hindered by poor distribution data and range maps. Many Indian primates face extinction, but assessments of population status are hindered by lack of reliable distribution data. We estimated the current occurrence and distribution of 15 Indian primates by applying occupancy models to field data from a country-wide survey of local experts. We modeled species occurrence in relation to ecological and social covariates (protected areas, landscape characteristics, and human influences), which we believe are critical to determining species occurrence in India. We found evidence that protected areas positively influence occurrence of seven species and for some species are their only refuge. We found evergreen forests to be more critical for some primates along with temperate and deciduous forests. Elevation negatively influenced occurrence of three species. Lower human population density was positively associated with occurrence of five species, and higher cultural tolerance was positively associated with occurrence of three species. We find that 11 primates occupy less than 15% of the total land area of India. Vulnerable primates with restricted ranges are Golden langur, Arunachal macaque, Pig-tailed macaque, stump-tailed macaque, Phayre\xe2\x80\x99s leaf monkey, Nilgiri langur and Lion-tailed macaque. Only Hanuman langur and rhesus macaque are widely distributed. We find occupancy modeling to be useful in determining species ranges, and in agreement with current species ranking and IUCN status. In landscapes where monitoring efforts require optimizing cost, effort and time, we used ecological and social covariates to reliably estimate species occurrence and focus species conservation efforts.'

Abstract: 'AbstractMitochondrial DNA sequences were used to investigate phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships among Australian freshwater shrimp from the genus Caridina H. Milne Edwards, 1837 (Atyidae) and congeners from potential source populations throughout the Indo-West Pacific region. Numerous Australian taxa have close evolutionary relationships with non-Australian taxa from locations throughout the region, indicating a diverse origin of the Australian freshwater fauna. This implies many colonisations to or from Australia over a long period, and thus highlights the surprising adeptness of freshwater shrimp in dispersal across ocean barriers and the unity of much of the region\xe2\x80\x99s freshwater biota. Interestingly, a study on Australia\xe2\x80\x99s other main genus of atyid shrimp, Paratya Miers, 1882, inferred only a single colonisation. A number of potential species radiations within Australia were also identified. This agrees with patterns detected for a large number of Australian freshwater taxa, and so implies a vicariant explanation due to the development of colder, dryer climates during the late Miocene/early Pliocene.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Termite mound soils have lower C but similar clay contents compared to surrounding control soils.\xe2\x80\xa2Soil macro-aggregates >250\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm from termite mounds are less stable than control soil aggregates.\xe2\x80\xa2Stability of termite mound soil micro-aggregates <250\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm is reduced in Ferralsol but not in Vertisol.AbstractTermites are considered soil engineers due to their effects on soil properties in tropical ecosystems, which include the production of biogenic aggregates with different physical and chemical properties to the surrounding environment. How termites influence the dynamics of aggregates on the soil surface is still poorly understood. In this study, we sampled 50\xe2\x80\x93250, 250\xe2\x80\x932000 and >2000\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm soil aggregates from the wall of termite mound nests produced by Odontotermes obesus (Blattoidea, Macrotermitinae subfamily) in a Ferralsol and in a Vertisol in Southern India and analyzed their stability in water and to ultrasonic agitation. Our study shows that the influence of termites on the stability of soil aggregates varies depending on the properties of soil. The concentrations in C and N were lower in termite mound soils compared to the control soil aggregates in the Ferralsol for all the soil aggregate size fractions whereas in the Vertisol, the C and N contents were only lower in soil aggregates >2000\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm (i.e., no significant difference for aggregates <2000\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm). No difference in clay, silt or sand content was measured between the termite mound wall and the control soil. Soil aggregate stability was reduced for all size categories of aggregate in the Ferralsol but it was only reduced for soil macro-aggregates >250\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm in the Vertisol. Since micro-aggregates <250\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm are considered to predominantly protect soil organic matter in the long term pools, the impact of termites on C protection and nutrient cycling may be higher in Ferralsols than in Vertisols.'

Title: 'Molecular phylogenetics and biogeography of the Neocellia Series of Anopheles mosquitoes in the Oriental Region'
Author: 'Katy'

Abstract: 'AbstractMolecular studies of population divergence and speciation across the Oriental Region are sparse, despite the region\xe2\x80\x99s high biodiversity and extensive Pliocene and Pleistocene environmental change. A molecular phylogenetic study of the Neocellia Series of Anopheles mosquitoes was undertaken to identify patterns of diversification across the Oriental Region and to infer the role of Pleistocene and Pliocene climatic change. A robust phylogeny was constructed using CO2 and ND5 mitochondrial genes and ITS2 and D3 nuclear ribosomal markers. Bayesian analysis of mitochondrial genes was used to date divergence events. The repeated contraction and expansion of forest habitat resulting from Pleistocene climatic fluctuations appears to have had a substantial impact on intraspecific diversification, but has not driven speciation within this group. Primarily early to mid Pliocene speciation was detected within the Annularis Group, whereas speciation within the Maculatus and Jamesii Groups occurred during the mid and late Pliocene. Both allopatric divergence driven by late Pliocene environmental changes and ecological adaptation, involving altitudinal replacement and seasonality, are likely to have influenced speciation in the Maculatus Group.'

Abstract: 'AbstractLymphatic filariasis is caused by three closely related nematode parasites: Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi and Brugia timori. These species have many ecological variants that differ in several aspects of their biology such as mosquito vector species, host range, periodicity, and morphology. Although the genome of B. malayi (the first genome sequenced from a parasitic nematode) has been available for more than five years, very little is known about genetic variability among the lymphatic dwelling filariae. The genetic diversity among these worms is not only interesting from a biological perspective, but it may have important practical implications for the Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis, as the parasites may respond differently to diagnostic tests and/or medical interventions. Therefore, better information on their genetic variability is urgently needed.

Abstract: 'SummaryThis study in the Hariyali sacred landscape (Garhwal Himalaya, India) was undertaken to evaluate the impact of ecosystem type, quality of organic inputs and water management on diversity and abundance of earthworms. A total of seven species viz., moniligastrid Drawida nepalensis (Michaelsen), lumbricid Allolobophora parva (Eisen), megascolecid Eutyphoeus sp. (near Eutyphoeus pharpingianus), octochaetid Octochaetona beatrix (Beddard), megascolecid Periyonx sp., octochaetid Lennogaster pusillus (Stephenson) and megascolecid Amynthas corticis (Baird), belonging to four families were found in the landscape. D. nepalensis had the widest distribution. Eutyphoeus sp., A. parva and Periyonx sp. were found only in forest ecosystems and L. pusillus and A. corticis only in agroecosystems. Total density of earthworms was highest under pine forest and species richness was greatest under the broad-leaved forest. Density and biomass of D. nepalensis and L. pusillus varied significantly between different years of cropping under rainfed agriculture receiving oak based or pine based organic inputs. Forest ecosystems had a mixed population of endemic and exotic species, whereas in agroecosystems endemics dominated. Epigeic species were the dominant functional group under broad-leaved forest and pine \xe2\x80\x93 broad-leaved mixed forests, whilst endogeic species were dominant under the pine forest. Irrigated agroecosystems receiving oak-based as well as pine-based organic inputs supported only endogeics, whereas both endogeic and epi-anecic species were observed in rainfed agroecosystems. This suggests that distribution of functional groups is determined by land use practices. Eutyphoeus sp. was the only species that showed a significant positive correlation with moisture and a negative correlation with pH and organic carbon. D. nepalensis and A. parva occurred under forest ecosystems and showed a significant positive correlation with lignin and C/N ratio, and a negative correlation with litter polyphenol concentration. Soil parameters and FYM-characteristics did not show any significant correlation with species occurring under agroecosystems. D. nepalensis, which is an endogeic but with a wide ecological amplitude, and the epigeic A. parva, present in large numbers in pine forest, are the two species which could be promoted for inoculation into litter-FYM based organic residue management pits.'

Title: 'Role of rainstorm intensity underestimated by data-derived flood models: Emerging global evidence from subsurface-dominated watersheds'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Hyetograph change gives nonlinear flood responses without overland flow activation.\xe2\x80\xa2New storm intensity - hydrograph relationship apparent from diverse synoptic regimes.\xe2\x80\xa2Implications for improved flood simulation under time-varying rainfall intensity regimes.AbstractIntense rainstorms are a prevalent feature of current weather. Evidence is presented showing that simulation of flood hydrographs shown to be dominated by subsurface flow requires watershed model parameterisation to vary between periods of different rainstorm intensity, in addition to varying with antecedent basin storage. The data show an emerging global relation between flood response and the intensity of rainstorms. Flood responses are quantified as watershed residence times (strictly time constants of nonlinear transfer-function models) identified directly from information contained within 15-min rainfall and streamflow observations. The emerging monotonic, curvilinear relation indicates that (subsurface) watershed residence time decreases as mean intensity rises, and is seen over a wide range of synoptic conditions from temperate and tropical climates. Projected increases in rainstorm intensity would then result in a greater likelihood of river floods in subsurface-dominated watersheds than is currently simulated by systems models omitting this additional nonlinearity.'

Abstract: 'AbstractStable isotope, elemental geochemistry and pollen analysis of a sediment profile from Sanai lake, Central Ganga Plain, were used to document climatic oscillations during the last \xe2\x88\xbc15,000\xc2\xa0yr in Indian subcontinent. Micaceous sandy sediments at the base of the profile indicate an active channel and humid conditions before \xe2\x88\xbc15,000 14C\xc2\xa0yr BP. The channel was abandoned during comparatively arid conditions (15,000\xe2\x80\x9313,000 14C\xc2\xa0yr BP) and converted into a swamp. Enhanced humidity around 13,000 14C\xc2\xa0yr BP led to submergence of marshes and establishment of a large lake. A dry phase is also identified around an estimated age of 11,500\xe2\x80\x9310,500 14C\xc2\xa0yr BP which might correspond to the Younger Dryas event witnessed globally. The Early to Mid-Holocene climatic optimum (\xe2\x88\xbc10,000\xe2\x80\x935800 14C\xc2\xa0yr BP) is characterised by a lake environment. Occurence of warmth loving aquatic plants, lower \xce\xb418O values of gastropod aragonite, heavier \xce\xb413Corg values indicate a sensitive response of the lake ecology to the climatic warming and increased rainfall. This is followed by an arid event during 5000\xe2\x80\x932000 14C\xc2\xa0yr BP and from \xe2\x88\xbc1700 14C\xc2\xa0yr BP there is evidence of climatic amelioration. The sequence and magnitude of the millenium-scale climatic oscillations documented along the lake profile correlate well with records from other parts of the Indian subcontinent indicating that the recorded changes are an expression of broad scale, probably global and climatic change.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The utility of phytoliths for investigating the origins of agriculture is reviewed by experts around the world.\xe2\x80\xa2Numerous morphological and size criteria differentiate crop plants and inform diverse questions on prehistoric agriculture.\xe2\x80\xa2Phytoliths have and will continue to be of significant, often unique, importance for this fundamental topic.AbstractAgricultural origins and dispersals are subjects of fundamental importance to archaeology as well as many other scholarly disciplines. These investigations are world-wide in scope and require significant amounts of paleobotanical data attesting to the exploitation of wild progenitors of crop plants and subsequent domestication and spread. Accordingly, for the past few decades the development of methods for identifying the remains of wild and domesticated plant species has been a focus of paleo-ethnobotany. Phytolith analysis has increasingly taken its place as an important independent contributor of data in all areas of the globe, and the volume of literature on the subject is now both very substantial and disseminated in a range of international journals. In this paper, experts who have carried out the hands-on work review the utility and importance of phytolith analysis in documenting the domestication and dispersals of crop plants around the world. It will serve as an important resource both to paleo-ethnobotanists and other scholars interested in the development and spread of agriculture.'

Title: 'ReviewA review on Anopheles culicifacies: From bionomics to control with special reference to Indian subcontinent'
Author: 'T.K.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001706X08002635
Abstract: 'AbstractAnopheles culicifacies, is a complex of five isomorphic sibling species A, B, C, D and E and is considered to be the major malaria vector in the Indian subcontinent. Despite numerous studies, it is difficult to have a global view of the ecological and bionomical characteristics of the individual sibling species, as different identification methods have been used. Major biological and ecological trends such as the high plasticity of behaviour and the sympatry of species are addressed. In spite of the availability of rapid molecular identification tools, we still lack important information concerning the biological characteristics of each sibling species. Resistance to insecticide is alarming as it has developed quadruple resistance in two states of India. An intensified and appropriate intervention measure to interrupt transmission is the call of the day. The authors focus on (1) reviewing the vectorial aspects of An. culicifacies (2) discussing recently published data on bionomics of each sibling species, (3) identifying lacunae in the understanding of the Culicifacies complex, and (4) exploring the possibility of proper control measures. Our understanding of the bionomics of all the five sibling species would certainly help, keeping in mind the climatic changes we are to face in the next few years.'

In a case study, the biofilms developed along a salinity gradient from marine to freshwater in a tropical monsoon influenced estuary (Zuari, west coast of India) were evaluated through in situ observations, and effect of translocation through microcosm experiments. The bacterial abundance was tide driven and high at the mouth of the estuary, whereas periphyton biomass, in terms of chlorophyll a was higher in the freshwater to brackish zone. These results point out decoupling of bacteria and phototrophic organisms in estuarine early stage biofilms. Vibrio spp. and faecal indicator bacteria were abundant in marine and brackish biofilms. The translocation experiments revealed that at times when marine biofilms with high total bacterial abundance were transferred to either brackish or freshwater, the abundance decreased. However, a significant increase in the bacterial abundance was observed when freshwater biofilms were transferred to either brackish or marine conditions. The microcosm experiments revealed that the influence of grazers differed with the type of biofilm and played an important role in modulating the composition of biofilms. The diagnostic pigments provided considerable insights into spatial and seasonal dynamics of periphyton groups in different biofilms and were determined by the surrounding water column communities and the availability of nutrients. Decay of freshwater periphyton in biofilms when translocated to marine and brackish conditions lead to remineralisation and higher bacterial population.'

Abstract: "AbstractEquality between economic progress and environmental sustainability is essential for a developing country like India. In the present time, the economy of India is growing rapidly in a vibrant mode and an efficient way, which in turn demands huge uninterrupted energy supplies. The country's energy needs are met mostly by the usage of fossil fuels and nearly 70% of electricity is generated from coal based power plants. In India, nearly 840 million people depend on traditional biomass to satisfy their energy necessities. Approximately 74 million rural people do not have access to modern lighting systems and around 81 million households do not have access to electricity, which is a major challenge to India's energy security. In order to achieve stable sustainable energy in the long-run, significant progress in renewable energy sectors is needed. Favorably, due to India's geographic location, the country is blessed with abundant renewable energy resources, which has not yet been exploited completely. So the central and state governments of the country have framed various policies and are providing subsidies to encourage the utilization of solar photovoltaic systems. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the potential, current developmental status and prospects of solar energy of India is briefed. The various applications of solar energy such as water heaters, desalination units, pasteurizers, food drying units, water purifier, space heating systems, air-conditioning units, cookers, water pumps, aerators, solar-wind hybrid systems and grid connected photovoltaic systems are explained. The study also mentions the current renewable energy policies, the barriers blocking the progress of the solar manufacturing units and some possible future recommendations that might speed up renewable energy developments in India."

Abstract: 'AbstractThe short-nosed fruit bat Cynopterus sphinx is known to exhibit resource defence polygyny as its primary mating strategy. Tent construction by harem males to recruit females represents a heavy investment of time and effort, which is not done by nonharem males. The previously unobserved mode of harem formation by the solitary males was studied using mark-recapture and radio-telemetry. In our observation, the solitary males roosting near to harems started recruiting females by occupying the tent abandoned by the harems. This result suggests that the transition of nonharem male to harem male status possibly by a previously unobserved mode and the female recruitment is associated with resource (roost). It implies that the solitary males are actively involving in female recruitment and also presumably mating.Zusammenfassung\xc3\x9cbergang von Nichtharem- zu Haremm\xc3\xa4nnchen beim Kurznasenflughund Cynopterus sphinx\xe2\x80\x9cDer Flughund Cynopterus sphinx nutzt Ressourcen-Verteidigungs-Polygynie als prim\xc3\xa4re Paarungsstrategie.

Title: 'A semi-distributed simulation model for natural pipeflow'
Author: 'J.A.A.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169402000185
Abstract: 'AbstractField monitoring of natural pipeflow over the last two decades has demonstrated its potential importance both as a hillslope drainage process and as a source of streamflow, yet very few attempts have been made to model the process. The main model designed to simulate pipeflow to date is shown to be unrepresentative of the natural field situation. This paper describes a semi-distributed simulation model with physically based parameters that has been designed around the field situation, as monitored in the longest run field experiment on pipeflow. The results are encouraging, despite the fact that data on a number of relevant parameters can be difficult to obtain at less intensely studied field sites.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2A new indirect method for LAI estimation in tropical deciduous forest was established.\xe2\x80\xa2We measured the LAI with LAI-2000 PCA in two seasons in three plant functional types (PFTs) (dry miscellaneous, sal mixed and teak plantations) in India.\xe2\x80\xa2Strong positive correlation between LAI with community structural variables (species richness, basal cover, stem density) and functional variables (litter fall and aboveground biomass, AGB) was observed.\xe2\x80\xa2Liner regression equations for predicting AGB (Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) from ground LAI were developed for all PFTs.AbstractRapid, reliable and meaningful estimates of leaf area index (LAI) are essential to functional characterization of forest ecosystems including biomass and primary productivity studies. Accurate LAI estimates of tropical deciduous forest are required in studies of regional and global change modeling. Tropical deciduous forest due to higher species richness, multiple species association, varied phenophases, irregular stem densities and basal cover, multistoried canopy architecture and different micro-climatic conditions offers dynamism to the understanding of the LAI dynamics of different PFTs in an ecosystem. This investigation reports a new indirect method for measurement of leaf area index (LAI) in a topical moist deciduous forest in Himalayan foothills using LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer. We measured the LAI in two seasons (summer; leaf senescence stage and post-monsoon; full green stage) in three (dry miscellaneous, sal mixed and teak plantations) plant functional types (PFT) in Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, India. Ground LAI values ranged between 2.41 and 6.89, 1.17 and 7.71, and 1.92 and 5.19 during post-monsoon season and 1.36\xe2\x80\x934.49, 0.67\xe2\x80\x933.1 and 0.37\xe2\x80\x931.83 during summer season in dry miscellaneous, sal mixed and teak plantation, respectively. We observed strong correlation between LAI and community structural parameters (tree density, basal cover and species richness), with maximum with annual litter fall (R2\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.8) and aboveground biomass (AGB) (R2\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.75). We provided equations relating LAI with AGB, which can be utilized in future studies for this region and can be reasonably extrapolated to other regions with suitable statistical extrapolations. However, the relations between LAI and other parameters can be further improved with incorporation of data from optimized and seasonal sampling. Our indirect method of LAI estimation using litter fall as a proxy, offers repetitive potential for LAI estimate in other PFTs with relatively time and cost-effective way, thereby generating quicker and reliable data for model run for regional and global change studies.'

Abstract: 'AbstractSheath blight of rice (Oryza sativa L.) caused by Rhizoctonia solani is a major disease and attempts are being made to develop microbe based technologies for biocontrol of this pathogen. However, the mechanisms of biocontrol are not fully understood and still require indepth study in the backdrop of emerging concepts in biological systems. The present investigation was aimed at deciphering the mechanisms of biocontrol of sheath blight of rice employing Pseudomonas fluorescens and Trichoderma harzianum as model agents for biocontrol. Initially 25, 5 and 5 strains of P. fluorescens, T. viride and T. harzianum, respectively, were screened for their biocontrol potential. Out of which, six strains with higher value of percent inhibition of fungal mycelium in dual plate assay were selected. The role of P. fluorescens, T. viride and T. harzianum were investigated in induction and bioaccumulation of natural antioxidants, defence-related biomolecules and other changes in plant which lead not only to growth promotion but also protection from pathogenic stress conditions in rice. The two most promising strains, P. fluorescens PF-08 and T. harzianum UBSTH-501 selected on the basis of in planta evaluation, when applied individually or in combination, significantly enhanced the accumulation of defence-related biomolecules, enzymes and exhibited biocontrol potential against R. solani. A modified/newly developed delivery system was applied for the first time in the experiments involving inoculation of plants with both bioagents, viz. P. fluorescens PF-08 and T. harzianum UBSTH-501. Results suggested that application of P. fluorescens PF-08 and T. harzianum UBSTH-501 alone or in combination, not only helps in control of the disease but also increases plant growth along with reduction in application of toxic chemical pesticides.'

We provide an understanding of the role of place in the experience of religious place attachment, describing in detail place, design, aesthetics, and special characteristics that facilitate devotion. Next, we describe how attachment to place is learned through the process of socialization involving rituals, use of artifacts, story telling, and place visits. We argue that there is an active socializing component to religious place attachment in addition to the experiential one. We conclude with a brief discussion integrating the complex issues of religion, place, identity, and attachment.'

Abstract: 'AbstractSatellite L-band synthetic aperture radar backscatter data from 1996 and 2007 (from JERS-1 and ALOS PALSAR respectively), were used with field data collected in 2007 and a back-calibration method to produce biomass maps of a 15\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0km2 forest\xe2\x80\x93savanna ecotone region of central Cameroon. The relationship between the radar backscatter and aboveground biomass (AGB) was strong (r2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.86 for ALOS HV to biomass plots, r2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.95 relating ALOS-derived biomass for 40 suspected unchanged regions to JERS-1 HH).

Abstract: 'AbstractIn natural ecosystems, termites are typical ecosystem engineers and, in semi-arid ecosystems, often keystone species. It is thus likely that termites play a major beneficial role through promotion of essential ecological processes in agroecosystems in conflict with their well-established role as pests. This paper reviews the impacts of land clearing and preparation, cropping systems and management practices on termite diversity and activity. Current knowledge of the role of termites in agroecosystem function is discussed with reference to soil processes, vegetation cover, atmospheric gas exchanges and agricultural intensification. Methods for assessing termite diversity and function are outlined and priority research areas are suggested.'

We hypothesized that post-abandonment species richness would have increased, and the structure of contemporary forest would be heterogeneous. Vegetation structure, composition, and diversity were recorded, in forty 0.1\xc2\xa0ha plots selected randomly in four forest ranges. Three soil samples per 0.1\xc2\xa0ha were assessed for physicochemistry, fine sand, and clay mineralogy. Contemporary forest had less species richness than pre-abandonment reference period. Fourteen species were recorded as either seedling or sapling, suggesting reappearance or immigration. For most species, regeneration was either absent or impaired. Ordination and multiple regression results showed that exchangeable base cations and phosphorous affected maximum tree diversity and structure variables. Significant correlations between soil moisture and temperature, and shrub layer was observed, besides tree layer correspondence with shrub richness, suggesting that dense overstory resulting from abandonment through its effect on soil conditions, is responsible for dense shrub layer. Herb layer diversity was negatively associated with tree layer and shrub overgrowth (i.e. Mallotus spp.). Protracted abandonment may not reinforce species richness and heterogeneity; perhaps result in high tree and shrub density in moist deciduous forests, which can impede immigrating or reappearing plant species establishment. This can be overcome by density/basal area reduction strategies, albeit for both tree and shrub layer.'

Title: 'Remotely sensed spectral heterogeneity as a proxy of species diversity: Recent advances and open challenges'
Author: 'Duccio'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954110000646
Abstract: 'AbstractEnvironmental heterogeneity is considered to be one of the main factors associated with biodiversity given that areas with highly heterogeneous environments can host more species due to their higher number of available niches. In this view, spatial variability extracted from remotely sensed images has been used as a proxy of species diversity, as these data provide an inexpensive means of deriving environmental information for large areas in a consistent and regular manner. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the state of the art in the use of spectral heterogeneity for estimating species diversity. We will examine a number of issues related to this theme, dealing with: i) the main sensors used for biodiversity monitoring, ii) scale matching problems between remotely sensed and field diversity data, iii) spectral heterogeneity measurement techniques, iv) types of species taxonomic diversity measures and how they influence the relationship between spectral and species diversity, v) spectral versus genetic diversity, and vi) modeling procedures for relating spectral and species diversity. Our review suggests that remotely sensed spectral heterogeneity information provides a crucial baseline for rapid estimation or prediction of biodiversity attributes and hotspots in space and time.'

Abstract: 'TrendsConservation requires methods to identify species and to identify, locate, and track individual plants and animals. These methods have become better, faster, less intrusive, and cheaper. So, too, has remote sensing that now allows detailed and frequent assessments of species\xe2\x80\x99 habitats and how human actions are changing them.Even the best technologies to mark individuals may pose unacceptable hazards for endangered species. Creative approaches find new, non-invasive alternatives.Crowdsourced data are becoming the dominant source of information on species\xe2\x80\x99 distributions and new approaches are solving the problems of reliability.The most important trends are progress in technologies that are appropriate to the often remote and low-technology environments in which frontline conservation actions unfold and the inclusion of previously unused communities who might contribute essential data.Technologies to identify individual animals, follow their movements, identify and locate animal and plant species, and assess the status of their habitats remotely have become better, faster, and cheaper as threats to the survival of species are increasing. New technologies alone do not save species, and new data create new problems. For example, improving technologies alone cannot prevent poaching: solutions require providing appropriate tools to the right people. Habitat loss is another driver: the challenge here is to connect existing sophisticated remote sensing with species occurrence data to predict where species remain. Other challenges include assembling a wider public to crowdsource data, managing the massive quantities of data generated, and developing solutions to rapidly emerging threats.'

Abstract: 'AbstractDetrital dynamics and microbial nutrient flux due to disturbances such as treefall and tree cutting were studied in a subtropical Pinus kesiya Royle Ex. Gordon forest in north-east India. Disturbance has substantially altered community structure, and therefore soil nutrient status. Natural gap formation has not resulted in significant changes in dry matter, C and N accumulation in litter and fine roots, or in microbial nutrient concentrations. However, there was a significant reduction in all functional parameters in the selectively logged site and soil heap. Soil microbial C, N and P were maximum in the understorey and minimun in the heap. Fine roots and microbial biomass contributed more to nutrient recycling in the ecosystem. N-mineralization was generally higher in the disturbed sites.'

Title: 'Agency within a socially regulated labour market: A study of \xe2\x80\x98unorganised\xe2\x80\x99 agricultural labour in Kerala'
Author: 'Terah'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718513000420
Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper combines insights from the social structures of accumulation framework, and a carefully delineated understanding of agency, to provide a conceptual and empirical contribution to the field of labour geography. This framework allows for a nuanced understanding of the complexity of the labour process as evinced by in-depth research conducted on the coconut industry in Kerala, India. The Kerala coconut industry has experienced various market changes post-agricultural liberalisation in the mid-1990s. The Government of Kerala has indicated these changes, including increasing imports of palm oil and new trade agreements, have led to a crisis; an issue of considerable importance to the state economy and farmers\xe2\x80\x99 livelihoods. More recent government explanations for the crisis include a labour shortage; particularly an inadequate supply of coconut harvesters. This simplistic explanation (based on neoclassical economic models) masks the complexity of locally constituted labour dynamics in an \xe2\x80\x98unorganised\xe2\x80\x99 labour market. A more nuanced understanding reveals that labour market organisation varies by place and difficulties are more adequately explained through changing agrarian relations and the inability to sufficiently control labour. These findings lead to three primary arguments: (1) labour markets are socially and spatially structured and their regulation varies with geographical, historical and political\xe2\x80\x93economic processes in particular places; (2) unorganised labour is able to regulate itself socially and informally, albeit in small ways; and (3) a structural approach is valuable to understand labour agency and the ways informal, unorganised labour is regulated.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Labour markets are socially and spatially structured. \xe2\x96\xba Unorganised labour regulates itself socially and informally. \xe2\x96\xba A combined structure\xe2\x80\x93agency approach is valuable to understand labour dynamics. \xe2\x96\xba Neoclassical economic understanding of labour market change is inadequate for policy. \xe2\x96\xba Coconut crisis in Kerala is linked to changing structures of labour control.'

Title: 'A multi-locus plastid phylogenetic analysis of the pantropical genus Diospyros (Ebenaceae), with an emphasis on the radiation and biogeographic origins of the New Caledonian endemic species'
Author: 'Sutee'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790309001377
Abstract: 'AbstractWe aimed to clarify phylogenetic relationships within the pantropical genus Diospyros (Ebenaceae sensulato), and ascertain biogeographical patterns in the New Caledonian endemic species. We used DNA sequences from eight plastid regions (rbcL, atpB, matK, ndhF, trnK intron, trnL intron, trnL-trnF spacer, and trnS-trnG spacer) and included 149 accessions representing 119 Diospyros species in our analysis. Results from this study confirmed the monophyly of Diospyros with good support and provided a clearer picture of the relationships within the genus than in previous studies. Evidence from phylogenetic analyses suggests that Diospyros colonized New Caledonia multiple times. The four lineages of Diospyros in New Caledonia also differ in their degree of diversification. The molecular data indicate that one lineage is paleoendemic and derived from an ancient Australian species. The other three lineages are more closely related to several Southeast Asian species; two of them are neoendemics, and one has radiated rapidly and recently.'

Abstract: "AbstractMurraya koenigii (L.) Spreng., commonly known as curry leaf plant, is found in the different hilly regions of India. In the present study, fifty-nine accessions representing eight wild populations of M. koenigii were analyzed using thirteen ISSR primers. A total of 152 bands were amplified, out of which, 136 were polymorphic corresponding to 89.47% polymorphism across the accessions. The pairwise population genetic distances were calculated for all the populations that varied from 0.05 to 0.13 between the populations of M. koenigii. AMOVA and Nei\xe2\x80\x99s genetic diversity analysis revealed higher genetic variations within populations than among the populations. The clustering of populations in the dendrogram was not in congruence with geographical affiliations.

Title: 'How far did India drift during the Late Cretaceous?\xe2\x80\x94Placenticeras kaffrarium Etheridge, 1904 (Ammonoidea) used as a measuring tape'
Author: 'Subhendu'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003707380100197X
Abstract: "AbstractIndia, once a member of the lost supercontinent Gondwana, broke away from it and made a solitary northward excursion and finally collided with Asia. During its long voyage, India remained isolated for 100 Ma and is expected to be characterized by stunning endemic biodiversity. But this is not recognized by the terrestrial faunal and floral content, and their distribution patterns paint no simple scenario. For example, the Inter-trappean vertebrate faunas of India, which lived during \xe2\x80\x9cIndia-in-exile\xe2\x80\x9d, do not show any made-in-India assemblages, but rather betray a mixed biota having both Gondwanan and Laurasian affinities. These differential distribution patterns of fauna and flora, and their affinities with those of other areas, prompted many workers to envisage an array of suggestions regarding the time of India's final separation from Gondwana, the time of northward drifting and different palaeopositions during its long journey. But closer examination of the nature of the vertebrate fossil records reveals that the so-called elusive endemicity of Indian fauna during its sojourn is in fact a product of taxonomic artefact. The majority of the faunas have been described on the basis of poor fossil data, and comparisons for biogeographic correlations are made at higher taxonomic levels, which perhaps masked India's faunal distinctiveness. Yet, the biological processes that constrain biogeographical distribution operate at the species level. In this paper, we present our own data to reconstruct the palaeoposition of India in the Late Cretaceous, and to estimate the time of its northward migration. The present study is based on a newly recorded ammonite species, Placenticeras kaffrarium Etheridge from the Coniacian horizons in Bagh, central India. The species abounds in Bagh and represents a complete population structure. It resembles significantly the populations described from the coeval horizons of Madagascar and Zululand, South Africa. P. kaffrarium has a stunning display of intraspecific variability represented by at least seven distinct morphotypes reported from Zululand and Madagascar. The Indian population, significantly matches the latter two populations, variant by variant and remarkably, also for the sexual dimorphs within each variant. Geographic range is a biological property of a species and ammonite species have differential distribution patterns depending on the length of larval longevity, oceanic circulation patterns and favourable environments. Placenticeras was a nektobenthic genus living in the shallowest depths of epicontinental seas, and could not cross a narrow strait wider than a few hundred kilometers. Palaeogeographic distribution patterns of all placenticeratid species during the Late Cretaceous support this view and show the wandering nature of the genus over time. However, they always exhibit a latitudinally limited distribution and are restricted mainly to the subtropics north and south of the equator. Thus, it appears that the P. kaffrarium population of Zululand, Madagascar and Bagh constitute a homogenous, single breeding population, implying geographical proximity of these areas, connected by exclusively shallow seas till the Coniacian. Other fossil records of ammonites and geophysical data also support this view. Shortly after this, India started its northward drift. By the Late Maastrichtian, India was completely isolated by a wide oceanic gap from the rest of the Gondwana fragments and the northern part of India crossed the equator. This is evident from strong endemicity of ammonite species assemblages of the northwest and southern Indian subcontinent, which constitute the most diverse communities known."

Title: 'Takarkori rock shelter (SW Libya): an archive of Holocene climate and environmental changes in the central Sahara'
Author: 'Mauro'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We study the formation of the stratigraphy at the Takarkori rock shelter in the Sahara.\xe2\x80\xa2We coupled the geoarchaeological/micromorphological and palynological approaches.\xe2\x80\xa2Results illustrate a natural and human contribution to sedimentation in a rock shelter.\xe2\x80\xa2Different parts of the sequence suffered distinct post-depositional processes.\xe2\x80\xa2Local environment and habitats greatly changed in the Holocene due to modification of rainfalls.AbstractRock shelters in the central Saharan massifs preserve anthropogenic stratigraphic sequences that represent both a precious archive for the prehistory of the region and a powerful proxy data for Holocene palaeoenvironments. The geoarchaeological (micromorphology) and archaeobotanical (pollen analysis) approaches were integrated to investigate the anthropogenic sedimentary sequence preserved within the Takarkori rock shelter, a Holocene archaeological site located in the Libyan central Sahara (southern Tadrart Acacus massif). The site was occupied throughout the Early and Middle Holocene (African Humid Period) by groups of hunter\xe2\x80\x93gatherers before and by pastoral communities later. The investigation on the inner part of the sequence allows to recognize the anthropogenic contribution to sedimentation process, and to reconstruct the major changes in the Holocene climate. At the bottom of the stratigraphic sequence, evidence for the earliest frequentation of the site by hunters and gatherers has been recognized; it is dated to c. 10,170\xc2\xa0cal\xc2\xa0yr\xc2\xa0BP and is characterized by high availability of water, freshwater habitats and sparsely wooded savannah vegetation. A second Early Holocene occupation ended at c. 8180\xc2\xa0cal\xc2\xa0yr\xc2\xa0BP; this phase is marked by increased aridity: sediments progressively richer in organics, testifying to a more intense occupation of the site, and pollen spectra indicating a decrease of grassland and the spreading of cattails, which followed a general lowering of lake level or widening of shallow-water marginal habitats near the site. After this period, a new occupational phase is dated between c. 8180 and 5610\xc2\xa0cal\xc2\xa0yr\xc2\xa0BP; this period saw the beginning of the frequentation of pastoral groups and is marked by an important change in the forming processes of the sequence. Sediments and pollen spectra confirm a new increase in water availability, which led to a change in the landscape surrounding the Takarkori rock shelter with the spreading of water bodies. The upper part of the sequence, dating between c. 5700 and 4650\xc2\xa0cal\xc2\xa0yr\xc2\xa0BP records a significant environmental instability towards dryer climatic conditions, consistent with the end of the African Humid Period. Though some freshwater habitats were still present, increasing aridity pushed the expansion of the dry savannah. The final transition to arid conditions is indicated by the preservation of ovicaprines dung layers at the top of the sequence together with sandstone blocks collapsed from the shelter's vault. On the contrary, the outer part of the sequence preserves a significantly different palaeoenvironmental signal; in fact, the surface was exposed to rainfall and a complex pedogenetic evolution of the sequence occurred, encompassing the formation of an argillic laminar horizon at the topsoil, the evolution of a desert pavement, and the deposition of Mn-rich rock varnish on stones. These processes are an effect of the general environmental instability that occurred in the central Sahara since the Middle Holocene transition. Finally, the local palaeoclimatic significance of the sequence fits well with Holocene regional and continental environmental changes recorded by many palaeohydrological records from North Africa. This highlights the potential of geoarchaeological and archaeobotanical investigations in interpreting the palaeoenvironmental significance of anthropogenic cave sediments in arid lands.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image"

Abstract: 'AbstractVesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) colonization and spore numbers in the rhizosphere of Cyperus iria L. and C.\xc2\xa0rotundus L., growing in a semi-arid tropical grassland, was studied during the 1993 and 1994 monsoons. In addition, climatic and chemical properties of the soils were determined in order to investigate their influence on mycorrhizal variables. VAM fungal association in the sedges was confirmed by plant- and root-trap culture techniques. The soil nutrients exhibited seasonal variations, but were highly variable between years. Intercellular hyphae and vesicles with occasional intraradical spores characterized mycorrhizal association in sedges. Dark septate fungi also colonized roots of sedges. Temporal variations in mycorrhizal colonization and spore numbers occurred, indicating seasonality. However, the patterns of mycorrhizal colonization and spore numbers were different during both the years. The VAM fungal structures observed were intercellular hyphae and vesicles. Changes in the proportion of root length with VAM structures, total colonization levels and spore numbers were related to climatic and edaphic factors. However, the intensity of influence of climatic and soil factors on VAM tended to vary with sedge species.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe generic allocation of Indian and Sri Lankan Philautus needs further examination. In this study, a comprehensive understanding of the phylogeny of Indian and Sri Lankan Philautus is obtained based on 12S and 16S rRNA genes. All phylogenetic analyses indicate that Indian-Sri Lankan Philautus, Philautus menglaensis, Philautus longchuanensis, and Philautus gryllus form a well supported clade, separate from Philautus of Sunda Islands that form another well supported clade representing true Philautus. This result supports the designation of the genus Pseudophilautus to accommodate the Indian and Sri Lankan species. Pseudophilautus consists of two major lineages, one comprises the majority of Indian species, Chinese species, and Southeast Asian species, and one comprises all Sri Lankan species and a few Indian species. Pseudophilautus may have originated in South Asia and dispersed into Southeast Asia and China. Based on the results, we further suggest that Philautus cf. gryllus (MNHN1997.5460) belongs to the genus Kurixalus.'

Title: 'Agricultural intensification, soil biodiversity and agroecosystem function in the tropics: the role of earthworms'
Author: 'C.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139396001540
Abstract: 'AbstractEarthworm biodiversity is modified when forests and natural savannas are replaced by agroecosystems; these changes can be studied from the taxonomic and functional point of view. In the first case the number and origin (native or exotic) of species is important, as well as the geographic scale of the study (local or regional). The functional approach considers the ecological groups (epigeic, endogeic, anecic), which have different effects on soil function. Studies in Mexico, Peru and India reveal that agroecosystem earthworm communities (as compared with those in the undisturbed ecosystem) have lower species richness, lower number of native species, lower number of ecological groups and a predominance of endogeics. Therefore the role of endogeic species in intensifying agroecosystems is likely to be more important for soil function, especially because they act as ecosystem engineers and through their mutualistic interactions with microflora, selective ingestion of soil particles, high rates of ingestion and production of casts, galleries, burrows and chambers can affect nutrient and organic matter dynamics and other pedological processes. Epigeic and anecic species do not appear to be as widespread in agricultural systems and their dependence on a litter layer for survival implies that litter management practices must be implemented for their role in soil function to be of importance.The role of earthworms in enhancing primary production depends on the synlocalization (in the same place) and the synchronization (at the same time) of their activities with the period and the sphere of active root growth and nutrient demands. Several field studies have found significant yield increases with earthworm inoculation, though more research is needed. Incorporation of information on earthworm life histories, field population variations, ecological strategies and short and long term effects on soil properties, in addition to plant and environmental factors (climate, soil, cropping period and management of the agroecosystem), are essential to properly assess the potential role of a particular earthworm species on plant production.Future research must focus on describing the role of native species and their interaction with or replacement by exotic species (belonging to the same or to a different ecological group) in soil function and agroecosystem productivity.'

Title: 'And yet it shrinks: A novel method for correcting bias in forest tree growth estimates caused by water-induced fluctuations'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Reversible stem shrinkage was estimated using tape and tree-ring measured growth.\xe2\x80\xa2This \xe2\x80\x98water growth\xe2\x80\x99 explained the variations in tape measured growth in a few trees.\xe2\x80\xa2It was effective as a proxy to estimate census-wise bias at the community level.\xe2\x80\xa2Proxy effectivity was sensitive to tree size and census timing, but not species.\xe2\x80\xa2This approach has potential for reinterpretation of temporal trends in tree growth.AbstractAccuracy in tree woody growth estimates is important to global carbon budget estimation and climate-change science. Tree growth in permanent sampling plots (PSPs) is commonly estimated by measuring stem diameter changes, but this method is susceptible to bias resulting from water-induced reversible stem shrinkage. In the absence of bias correction, temporal variability in growth is likely to be overestimated and incorrectly attributed to fluctuations in resource availability, especially in forests with high seasonal and inter-annual variability in water. We propose and test a novel approach for estimating and correcting this bias at the community level.In a 50-ha PSP from a seasonally dry tropical forest in southern India, where tape measurements have been taken every four years from 1988 to 2012, for nine trees we estimated bias due to reversible stem shrinkage as the difference between woody growth measured using tree rings and that estimated from tape. We tested if the bias estimated from these trees could be used as a proxy to correct bias in tape-based growth estimates at the PSP scale.We observed significant shrinkage-related bias in the growth estimates of the nine trees in some censuses. This bias was strongly linearly related to tape-based growth estimates at the level of the PSP, and could be used as a proxy. After bias was corrected, the temporal variance in growth rates of the PSP decreased, while the effect of exceptionally dry or wet periods was retained, indicating that at least a part of the temporal variability arose from reversible shrinkage-related bias. We also suggest that the efficacy of the bias correction could be improved by measuring the proxy on trees that belong to different size classes and census timing, but not necessarily to different species.Our approach allows for reanalysis \xe2\x80\x93 and possible reinterpretation \xe2\x80\x93 of temporal trends in tree growth, above ground biomass change, or carbon fluxes in forests, and their relationships with resource availability in the context of climate change.'

Abstract: 'AbstractTropical Asian Galliformes are secretive and difficult to survey. Many of these species are considered \xe2\x80\x9cat risk\xe2\x80\x9d due to habitat degradation although reliable density estimates are lacking. Using camera trapping and distance sampling data collected on the Siamese Fireback (Lophura diardi) in northeastern Thailand, we compared density estimates for pristine and degraded lowland forest. Density was poorly estimated using distance sampling, likely due to small sample size arising from poor visibility in dense vegetation and bird\xe2\x80\x99s sensitivity to observers. We analysed camera trap data using both count-based and presence/absence-based methods. Those density estimates had narrower confidence intervals than those obtained using distance sampling. Estimated density was higher in dry evergreen forest (5.6\xc2\xa0birds\xc2\xa0km\xe2\x88\x922), than in old forest plantations (0.2\xc2\xa0birds\xc2\xa0km\xe2\x88\x922), perhaps because dense forest habitats provide Firebacks with more resources and refuge from predation. Our results suggest that camera trap data can be used for estimating density of cryptic terrestrial bird species inhabiting tropical forest that lack unique identification markings. However, this technique requires that the effective sampling area is known and thus requires knowledge of the animal home range size.'

Title: 'Research paperIndividual-based simulation models for forest succession and management'
Author: 'Jianguo'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037811279403490N
Abstract: 'AbstractIndividual-based forest models simulate forest dynamics on the basis of establishment, growth and death of individual trees. This paper attempts to review and compare two major types of individual-based forest models: growth-yield and gap models. Although the two types of models share some similar features, they differ in model structure and data requirements and play several complementary roles. Growth-yield models are used by foresters to assist timber production and evaluate growth and yield of one to several commercial timber species in managed forests, while gap models are generally developed by ecologists to explore ecological mechanisms and patterns of structure and functional dynamics in natural forest ecosystems. Site-specific environmental and species information is necessary for constructing growth-yield models while gap models require species-specific biological information of individual trees and site-specific environmental data. The growth-yield models are more diverse in terms of model structure. In contrast, gap models belong to the same genealogy and later gap models are ultimately derived from the earliest one although they may vary in detail. In the future, we expect to see more individual-based hybrid models which integrate gap models with growth-yield models and ecophysiological models. As computer technology advances explosively, individual-based models could be much more efficient and user-friendly. There have existed disproportionately few individual-based models for biodiverse forests such as evergreen tropical rain forests. Development of individual-based models for tropical rain forests is more challenging and is being stimulated by new international conservation efforts.'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The first ever global trait-based analysis of climate change vulnerability in reptiles\xe2\x80\xa2Data were collected for a random sample of 1498 reptiles.\xe2\x80\xa280.5% of species were highly sensitive to climate change.\xe2\x80\xa2Overall, 22% of species were found to be highly vulnerable to climate change.\xe2\x80\xa2Climate change vulnerable species do not spatially overlap species listed as threatened on the IUCN Red List.AbstractOne-fifth of the world's reptiles are currently estimated as threatened with extinction, primarily due to the immediate threats of habitat loss and overexploitation. Climate change presents an emerging slow-acting threat. However, few IUCN Red List assessments for reptiles explicitly consider the potential role of climate change as a threat. Thus, climate change vulnerability assessments can complement existing Red List assessments and highlight further, emerging priorities for conservation action.Here we present the first trait-based global climate change vulnerability assessment for reptiles to estimate the climate change vulnerability of a random representative sample of 1498 species of reptiles. We collected species-specific traits relating to three dimensions of climate change, sensitivity, low adaptability, and exposure, which we combined to assess overall vulnerability.We found 80.5% of species highly sensitive to climate change, primarily due to habitat specialisation, while 48% had low adaptability and 58% had high exposure. Overall, 22% of species assessed were highly vulnerable to climate change. Hotspots of climate change vulnerability did not always overlap with hotspots of threatened species richness, with most of the vulnerable species found in northwestern South America, southwestern USA, Sri Lanka, the Himalayan Arc, Central Asia and southern India. Most families were found to be significantly more vulnerable to climate change than expected by chance.Our findings build on previous work on reptile extinction risk to provide an overview of the risk posed to reptiles by climate change. Despite significant data gaps for a number of traits, we recommend that these findings are integrated into reassessments of species' extinction risk, to monitor both immediate and slow-acting threats to reptiles."

Title: 'Odonata enter the biodiversity crisis debate: The first global assessment of an insect group'
Author: 'Viola'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320709001621
Abstract: 'AbstractThe status and trends of global biodiversity are often measured with a bias towards datasets limited to terrestrial vertebrates. The first global assessment of an insect order (Odonata) provides new context to the ongoing discussion of current biodiversity loss. A randomly selected sample of 1500 (26.4%) of the 5680 described dragonflies and damselflies was assessed using IUCN\xe2\x80\x99s Red List criteria. Distribution maps for each species were created and species were assigned to habitat types. These data were analysed in respect to threat level for regions and habitat types. We have found that one in 10 species of dragonflies and damselflies is threatened with extinction. This threat level is among the lowest of groups that have been assessed to date, suggesting that previous estimates of extinction risk for insects might be misleading. However, Odonata only comprise a small invertebrate order, with above-average dispersal ability and relatively wide distribution ranges. For conservation science and policy to be truly representative of global biodiversity a representative cross-section of invertebrates needs to be included.'

Title: 'Liana loads and post-logging liana densities after liana cutting in a lowland forest in Bolivia'

Abstract: 'AbstractLiana infestations can be a problem in forests managed for timber because lianas decrease rates of tree growth, damage tree boles, and inhibit tree regeneration. To determine the area from which lianas colonize tree crowns in a liana-rich moist lowland forest in a timber concession in the Department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, we described \xe2\x80\x9cliana sheds\xe2\x80\x9d of individual canopy trees (the area under the crown and beyond its margins from which lianas colonize trees). In the same area we tested the hypothesis that pre-logging cutting of lianas in a harvested tree\xe2\x80\x99s liana shed reduces post-logging liana infestations. Prior to logging, 73% of 570 trees >10\xc2\xa0cm in DBH representing 12 commercial species, carried at least one liana >2\xc2\xa0cm DBH. Liana-infested trees hosted an average of 9.3 lianas (\xc2\xb10.45 S.E., range: 1\xe2\x80\x9368). The mean area of the crown covered by lianas was 35% (\xc2\xb129.7 S.E.) but some trees (10%) were completely covered by lianas. \xe2\x80\x9cLiana shed areas\xe2\x80\x9d were a function of crown area and varied among tree species. Most lianas on trees were rooted below the crown of their host (90%); the number of lianas decreased with increasing distance from the crown edge, but lianas colonized trees from as far as 8\xc2\xa0m beyond the crown. Overall, there was a significant reduction in the number of lianas in 22 felling gaps 8 months after logging where lianas were cut before logging compared with 22 control gaps. In control gaps, the majority of climbing lianas sprouted from the prostrate stems of fallen canopy lianas (81%), including 3.1\xc2\xa0km/ha of stems that were rooted along the ground before logging. Liana regeneration in gaps after pre-logging liana cutting occurred mainly by stump sprouting (41%) and sprouting from prostrate stems (48%). Pre-felling liana cutting reduced liana cover in felling gaps by 9% only but reduced liana basal area by 69%. The results of this study suggest that tree crown area, shape, and height are among the most important factors determining the likelihood of liana colonization of canopy trees and that pre-logging liana cutting reduces post-logging liana proliferation in logging gaps.'

Abstract: 'SummaryUnderstanding of the role and potential of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) for livelihood improvement and conservation has been hindered by a lack of a clear theoretical framework and a functional typology of cases. To help fill this gap, we did a comparative analysis of 61 cases of commercial NTFP production in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Cases were documented using a standardized set of descriptors organized into categories describing various aspects of the production-to-consumption system. Exploratory analysis yielded useful case groupings by (a) household economic strategy and (b) NTFP production strategy. These groups and their key characteristics are used as a basis for discussing the development and conservation implications of NTFPs.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe role of irrigation in India in expanding crop production, reducing output instability and providing protection against periodic drought has been a major factor in the substantial achievement of Indian agriculture over the past four decades. Irrigated crop yields are, however, only half those obtained elsewhere in Asia and if growth rates are to be maintained in the face of increasing technical, environmental and social limits being placed on the availability of water, the need to increase productivity per unit of water is a key issue. India is now faced with a number of critical choices in irrigation management. The choice lies between a continuation of the present, possibly diminishing, agricultural growth rate, or a widespread reform and renewal of irrigation management practices. Food production in India will become increasingly dependent upon irrigation. Over 55% of agricultural output is from irrigated lands and production from rainfed areas is faced with lack of land for expansion and the prevailing risk of drought. The pricing environment, rural infrastructure and services are also fundamental to agricultural growth, but the resolution of water constraints enabled by irrigation is the key for productive capability.'

Title: 'Evaluation of geochemical behavior and heavy metal distribution of sediments: The case study of the Tirumalairajan river estuary, southeast coast of India'
Author: 'Senapathi'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001627915600038
Abstract: "AbstractThe purpose of this study was to assess the chemical partitioning of selected heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, Co and Ni) in 10 surface sediments at Tirumalairajan River Estuary in the southeastern coast of India. A five-step sequential extraction technique was used to assess the environmental status of heavy metals. Most of metals were considered to be immobile due to the high availability in the residual fraction of heavy metals. The sediments of Tirumalairajan River estuary had not been polluted by heavy metals, and they didn't pose any high ecological risk. The seasonal variations of heavy metals were slightly higher in summer than in monsoon season. Factor analysis was also carried out to understand the associations of metals in different fractions with sand, silt, clay, organic matter, pH, salinity and other metals. The relationship between the Q-mode and R-mode cluster analyses was useful for identifying the pollution levels in both seasons. It was proved that the enrichment of heavy metals was related with geogenic and anthropogenic sources. The information on total metal concentrations in sediments was not sufficient for assessing the metal behavior in the environment, but the sequential extraction technique was more effective in estimating the environmental impact of contaminated sediments."

Title: 'Effects on soil chemistry of tropical deforestation for agriculture and subsequent reforestation with special reference to changes in carbon and nitrogen'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Baseline soil properties of rainforest, tea-land, fern-land, and pine.\xe2\x80\xa2Legacy effects of land conversion to agriculture from fertilization and fire.\xe2\x80\xa2Both \xce\xb413C and \xce\xb415N increased with depth under pine and fern-lands.\xe2\x80\xa2Natural regeneration beneath pine facilitates faster decomposition.AbstractWhile soils can act either as a source or as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide and nitrogen, depending on land cover change and management, there is a great need to improve our understanding of the dynamics of soil structure and chemistry following land conversion in tropical regions. In this study, we investigated various soil structural and chemical variables (bulk density, pH, cation exchange capacity, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium), soil carbon (C), soil nitrogen (N), \xce\xb413C, and \xce\xb415N in relation to conversion of rain forest to tea cultivation and subsequent changes due to agricultural abandonment and reforestation with Caribbean pine. Although Caribbean pine has shown potential for reforestation throughout Asia and Latin America, effects on soil properties in comparison with other land uses have not been quantified. Our study compared: (1) the original mixed-dipterocarp rain forest, (2) tea plantations, (3) Kekilla fernlands and (4) Caribbean pine plantations. Tea plantations show higher bulk density (BD) as an evidence of compaction. Although soil C concentration in tea plantations were lower than other land uses at 0\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0cm, when bulk density was used with C as a composite measure, tea plantation showed the highest value for both soil C and N stocks. Disregarding tea plantations, Caribbean pine plantations had the highest C but showed the lowest N stocks at both soil depths. Soil \xce\xb413C and \xce\xb415N values of all land uses increase with increasing soil depth; but Caribbean pine plantations showed the greatest increase in \xce\xb413C at both soil depths (e.g. \xe2\x88\x9227.82\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.38\xe2\x80\xb0 at 0\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0cm to \xe2\x88\x9226.50\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.37\xe2\x80\xb0 at 10\xe2\x80\x9320\xc2\xa0cm). For both Kekilla fernlands and Caribbean pine plantations the relationship between \xce\xb413C and \xce\xb415N was strongly linear. By comparing the physical and chemical soil properties of these land uses with undisturbed rain forest, we established baseline data to determine influence of land conversion on soil properties. Based on soil pH, CEC and other major nutrients (P, K, Mg), there are strong legacy effects of land use potentially from both fertilization and fire. Our results also showed strong evidence that \xce\xb413C and \xce\xb415N was both increased with depth under pine reforestation and fernlands, suggesting soils can recuperate with a consistent input of litter and slower decomposition processes. There is some evidence that recruitment of natural regeneration beneath pine can help facilitate faster litter decomposition that can revert soil structure and fertility to a status similar to that of the original forest.'

We investigated the processes underlying the fungal endophyte assemblages of phylogenetically related Myrtae host tree species at different spatial scales: regional, 101\xe2\x80\x935\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0km; local, 0\xe2\x80\x93100\xc2\xa0km; and microscale, 0\xe2\x80\x931\xc2\xa0km. A total of 939 isolates was obtained and assigned to 51 distinct MOTUs based on the sequencing of the nrITS region. At regional scales, geographic distance was responsible for explaining the fungal community similarity, while, at a local scale, it was the environmental distance. Moreover, fungal endophytes exhibit preference in the colonization of Luma apiculata but not for Myrceugenia ovata var. nanophylla. Our results suggest that fungal endophytes are not randomly distributed and are influenced by both geographic and environment distances depending on the spatial scale analysed.'

Title: 'Systematics and character evolution in Durio s. lat. (Malvaceae/Helicteroideae/Durioneae or Bombacaceae-Durioneae)'
Author: 'Reto'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S143960920470015X
Abstract: 'AbstractA molecular phylogenetic study of Durio s.lat. was conducted based on sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA for 30 ingroup exemplars, representing 16 species, and two taxa of Cullenia as outgroups. The phylogeny suggests the existence of two well-circumscribed clades composed, respectively, of species with poricidal pollen locules (Boschia) and species with pollen locules that open with longitudinal slits (Durio s.str.). The latter clade is subdivided into two strongly supported clades: /Tubulidurio, with highly fused filaments and free calyx lobes, and /Palatadurio, with largely free filaments and connate calyx lobes. We provide phylogenetic definitions for the names of these well-supported clades. Reconstruction of floral evolution is consistent with the hypothesis that vertebrate pollination is ancestral for Durio s.lat. and Cullenia. However, there have been further shifts in pollination system within Durio s.lat., which may account for some of the current diversity of floral characters. The correlation of fruit and aril characteristics suggests that there are two major dispersal syndromes, involving either birds (fruits opening on trees; aril red/yellow and odorless) or terrestrial mammals (fruits opening only after falling to the ground; aril pale colored and pungent). The distribution of extant taxa implies a Malesian origin and radiation of the study group, with a single dispersal of Cullenia to India and Sri Lanka. However, the fossil pollen record raises the possibility that Durio and relatives may have migrated to Southeast Asia from the Indian subcontinent after it collided with Asia. A molecular clock analysis suggests that the earliest divergence within the study group occurred about 20 to 32 mya and, hence, does not favor either biogeographic scenario.'

Title: 'Tapping latex and alleles? The impacts of latex and bark harvesting on the genetic diversity of Himatanthus drasticus (Apocynaceae)'
Author: 'Cristina'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We studied the effects of harvesting on the genetic diversity of Himatanthus drasticus.\xe2\x80\xa2High levels of genetic diversity and inbreeding were observed in all populations.\xe2\x80\xa2A reduction of genetic diversity was detected in high-harvested populations.\xe2\x80\xa2Suggestions for conservation of the genetic diversity of H. drasticus were provided.AbstractThe importance of genetic variation for maintaining biological diversity and evolutionary processes is widely accepted; however, limited action has been taken to protect genetic diversity in natural populations. Until recently, it was assumed that the exploitation of non-timber forest products, such as fruits, barks and exudates, had low environmental impact, but recognition that the harvesting of these plants can affect several biological levels, including genetic diversity and structure, has been growing. Nevertheless, the effect of harvesting non-timber forest products on the genetic diversity of the harvested species is poorly understood. The objective of this work is to assess the impact of harvesting on the genetic diversity of Himatanthus drasticus (Apocynaceae), a tree of the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) that is highly exploited for its medicinal latex. We tested the hypothesis that harvesting can cause a trade-off between survival and reproduction in H. drasticus, reducing the effective population size as well as the genetic diversity in highly exploited populations. The study was conducted in the Araripe National Forest, a preserved Cerrado area in Cear\xc3\xa1 State, Brazil. We sampled six populations that included two different levels of harvesting (high-harvest and low-harvest) and characterized the genetic diversity and structure in two groups (adults and seedlings) using microsatellite markers. We verified high levels of polymorphism in H. drasticus; however, significant levels of inbreeding in all studied populations were also observed. We found a higher degree of genetic structure in the seedling group when compared with the adult group, a difference that was most likely due to seed rain deposited in nearby locations. No differences were detected in adult genetic diversity levels between populations under different harvesting intensities. However, seedling allelic richness was significantly lower in the high-harvested populations, indicating allelic losses that may be associated with the exploitation of bark and latex. Evidence of genetic loss due to overharvesting was supported by significant bottleneck signatures observed in the seedling group of two out of three high-harvest populations. The establishment of a conservation strategy is imperative to avoid future genetic losses and ensure the long-term viability of H. drasticus populations. The information obtained in this study has been integrated with ecological information about the effects of latex tapping on phenology, demography and biomass recovery of exploited populations, with the goal of proposing a sustainable management plan for the species.'

Abstract: 'AbstractFood preference behaviour of Funambulus pennanti Wroughton was studied offering four different types of cereals, viz. wheat, millet, maize and rice in three textural forms, viz. whole dry, cracked and whole moist in no-choice, bi-choice and multiple-choice to the experimental squirrels. The mean daily intake of F. pennanti in no-choice has been recorded to be 3.53 to 11.70 g, which, however, increased to 6.31 to 14.19 g and 20.12 to 33.98 g in bi-choice and multiple-choice experiments, respectively. The preference of squirrels in the no-choice feeding experiment was for cracked millet, whole moist wheat and whole dry wheat. In bi-choice feeding experiments, squirrels preferred cracked millet, whole moist millet and whole dry rice. In multiple-choice experiments, the squirrels showed a preference for cracked millet, whole moist and dry wheat and rice. On overall basis, cracked millet was highly preferred by the squirrels. In pen-feeding experiments where the squirrels were offered 12 different foods along with the different plant material including weeds, grasses, twigs of fruit trees, revealed the sustenance in preference of squirrels for cracked millet, whole moist millet, whole moist and dry wheat and whole dry rice in descending order. Squirrels neither formed any nest nor hoarded any food in the experimental pen. Squirrels did not reject any food during choice preference experiments and demonstrated optimal behaviour. Overall, squirrels exhibited a \xe2\x80\x98Generalist\xe2\x80\x99 feeding pattern. The present findings indicate that cracked millet should be used as a poison carrier for control of squirrels while other preferred cereals can also be used as a bait for mixing poison in the subsequent control operations.'

Abstract: 'SummaryBacterial antagonists of Phytophthora capsici were isolated from underground shoot portions of rooted cuttings of black pepper. Initially isolates were screened by dual culture on potato dextrose agar and carrot agar. Further, a screening was done on black pepper shoots for supression of lesion caused by the pathogen. Most of the antagonists showed varying levels of antagonism in the dual culture and the shoot assay. Isolate PN-026, showing the highest suppression of lesion development in the shoot assay was found to be the most efficient antagonist in reducing Phytophthora capsici induced nursery wilt of black pepper. This screening involving the host, pathogen, and the antagonist, performed on black pepper shoot (the planting material for this vegetatively propagated crop), could be used as a rapid and reliable method for the isolation of efficient bacterial antagonists of P. capsici.'

Abstract: 'ABSTRACTCytosine methylation is a fundamental epigenetic mechanism for gene-expression regulation and development in plants. Here, we report for the first time the identification of DNA methylation patterns and their putative relationship with abiotic stress in the tree crop Hevea brasiliensis (source of 99% of natural rubber in the world). Regulatory sequences of four major genes involved in the mevalonate pathway (rubber biosynthesis pathway) and one general defense-related gene of three high-yielding popular rubber clones grown at two different agroclimatic conditions were analyzed for the presence of methylation. We found several significant variations in the methylation pattern at core DNA binding motifs within all the five genes. Several consistent clone-specific and location-specific methylation patterns were identified. The differences in methylation pattern observed at certain pivotal cis-regulatory sites indicate the direct impact of stress on the genome and support the hypothesis of site-specific stress-induced DNA methylation. It is assumed that some of the methylation patterns observed may be involved in the stress-responsive mechanism in plants by which they adapt to extreme conditions. The study also provide clues towards the existence of highly divergent phenotypic characters among Hevea clones despite their very similar genetic make-up. Altogether, the observations from this study prove beyond doubt that there exist epigenetic variations in Hevea and environmental factors play a significant role in the induction of site-specific epigenetic mutations in its genome.'

Abstract: 'AbstractUnderstanding carbon stocks relative to tree species is important for managing tropical forests in a way that will result in the carbon emission reductions and biodiversity conservation required under the REDD+\xc2\xa0scheme. Here we analyse inventory data from 179 sample plots in semi-evergreen forests of three provinces in Cambodia. Across all study sites, 5,995 trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) \xe2\x89\xa510\xc2\xa0cm, comprising 79 species from 38 families, were analysed. Tree species of the Dipterocarpaceae were most common (10 species), followed by the species of Caesalpinaceae, Combretaceae and Ebenaceae. Analysis of relative carbon stocks (RCS) suggested that Lagerstroemia calyculata Kurz (RCS=14.3%), Syzygium sp. (6.8%), Shorea vulgaris (5.0%), Irvingia malayana (4.8%), Anisoptera costata Kort (4.6%), Vatica astrotricha (4.2%), and Dehaasia cuneata Blume (3.8%) together accounted for 43.6% of the total average carbon stocks of 99.8\xc2\xb14.8\xc2\xa0MgC\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. We found that carbon stock is highly correlated to basal area (R2=0.993) but not to stem density (R2=0.153). Using carbon stock values, we estimated the carbon emission due to deforestation of semi-evergreen forests to be 8.3\xc2\xa0TgCO2 \xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 in Cambodia between 2002 and 2010. These emissions and the loss of 79 tree species in our study sites could be avoided if financial incentives were available for protecting semi-evergreen forests in Cambodia.'

Abstract: "AbstractThe objective of the present study was to investigate arbuscular mycorrhizal status of five species of rhododendrons distributed in Kumaun region of the Indian Central Himalaya. Root and rhizosphere soil samples of all the five species of rhododendrons, namely, Rhododendron anthopogon, R. arboreum, R. campanulatum, R. barbatum and R. lepidotum were collected from temperate, sub-alpine to alpine location in altitudinal range from 1500 to 4500\xc2\xa0m amsl. The arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization in root samples ranged from 28 to 42%; and maximum and minimum colonization was observed in R. arboreum and R. lepidotum, respectively. The highest number of intraradical vesicles (12.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02.8\xc2\xa0cm\xe2\x88\x921 root segment) was recorded in R. arboreum and the lowest (7.0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.7\xc2\xa0cm\xe2\x88\x921 root segment) in R. barbatum; vesicles were not observed in R. lepidotum. Spores were extracted from the rhizosphere soil by wet sieving to perform microscopic identification of the species. The maximum and minimum populations of spores were detected in the rhizosphere soil samples of R. anthopogon (52.0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.5\xc2\xa0spores\xc2\xa025\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0soil) and R. lepidotum (32.0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02.5\xc2\xa0spore\xc2\xa025\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0soil), respectively. Spore populations were found to belong to five genera\xe2\x80\x94Acaulospora, Glomus, Gigaspora, Sclerocystis and Scutellispora; genus Glomus was found to be dominant in the rhizosphere soil samples of all the rhododendron species. The most frequent and abundant species was G. fasciculatum, however, this species was not isolated from the rhizosphere soil of R. barbatum. Finger millet (Eleucine coracana) was used to cultivate the trap culture of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to confirm the species identity. Spores of Glomus pustulatum, not detected in the rhizosphere soil, were recovered from the trap culture. Contrary to this, genus Gigaspora, which was present in the rhizosphere soil, did not sporulate in the trap culture. Shannon and Wiener index of diversity and Simpson's index of dominance indicated that the species richness, dominance and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi decrease with increasing altitude. In two species of rhododendrons, namely R. campanulatum and R. anthopogon, dark septate mycelium was also observed."

Abstract: 'AbstractThere are plans to double the area of strictly protected tropical forest. This article suggests that the siting and management of such reserves are based on models of conservation inappropriate to developing countries, and that an ignorance of past and present tropical land use will prevent reserves achieving their major objective of conserving useful biodiversity. Strict preservation could also destroy the indigenous knowledge needed for ecosystem management. Multipurpose management and continued human use of tropical forests is a more effective and sustainable conservation policy for tropical developing countries. Rural communities should be actively and physically involved in the future productive management of tropical forests, rather than being induced or pressured into abandoning their forest heritage.'

Title: 'Human impacts to mountain streams'
Author: 'Ellen'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X06002522
Abstract: 'AbstractMountain streams are here defined as channel networks within mountainous regions of the world. This definition encompasses tremendous diversity of physical and biological conditions, as well as history of land use. Human effects on mountain streams may result from activities undertaken within the stream channel that directly alter channel geometry, the dynamics of water and sediment movement, contaminants in the stream, or aquatic and riparian communities. Examples include channelization, construction of grade-control structures or check dams, removal of beavers, and placer mining. Human effects can also result from activities within the watershed that indirectly affect streams by altering the movement of water, sediment, and contaminants into the channel. Deforestation, cropping, grazing, land drainage, and urbanization are among the land uses that indirectly alter stream processes. An overview of the relative intensity of human impacts to mountain streams is provided by a table summarizing human effects on each of the major mountainous regions with respect to five categories: flow regulation, biotic integrity, water pollution, channel alteration, and land use. This table indicates that very few mountains have streams not at least moderately affected by land use. The least affected mountainous regions are those at very high or very low latitudes, although our scientific ignorance of conditions in low-latitude mountains in particular means that streams in these mountains might be more altered than is widely recognized. Four case studies from northern Sweden (arctic region), Colorado Front Range (semiarid temperate region), Swiss Alps (humid temperate region), and Papua New Guinea (humid tropics) are also used to explore in detail the history and effects on rivers of human activities in mountainous regions. The overview and case studies indicate that mountain streams must be managed with particular attention to upstream/downstream connections, hillslope/channel connections, process domains, physical and ecological roles of disturbance, and stream resilience.'

Title: 'GR Focus ReviewThe longest voyage: Tectonic, magmatic, and paleoclimatic evolution of the Indian plate during its northward flight from Gondwana to Asia'
Author: 'Sankar'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe tectonic evolution of the Indian plate, which started in Late Jurassic about 167\xc2\xa0million years ago (~\xc2\xa0167\xc2\xa0Ma) with the breakup of Gondwana, presents an exceptional and intricate case history against which a variety of plate tectonic events such as: continental breakup, sea-floor spreading, birth of new oceans, flood basalt volcanism, hotspot tracks, transform faults, subduction, obduction, continental collision, accretion, and mountain building can be investigated. Plate tectonic maps are presented here illustrating the repeated rifting of the Indian plate from surrounding Gondwana continents, its northward migration, and its collision first with the Kohistan\xe2\x80\x93Ladakh Arc at the Indus Suture Zone, and then with Tibet at the Shyok\xe2\x80\x93Tsangpo Suture. The associations between flood basalts and the recurrent separation of the Indian plate from Gondwana are assessed. The breakup of India from Gondwana and the opening of the Indian Ocean is thought to have been caused by plate tectonic forces (i.e., slab pull emanating from the subduction of the Tethyan ocean floor beneath Eurasia) which were localized along zones of weakness caused by mantle plumes (Bouvet, Marion, Kerguelen, and Reunion plumes). The sequential spreading of the Southwest Indian Ridge/Davie Ridge, Southeast Indian Ridge, Central Indian Ridge, Palitana Ridge, and Carlsberg Ridge in the Indian Ocean were responsible for the fragmentation of the Indian plate during the Late Jurassic and Cretaceous times. The R\xc3\xa9union and the Kerguelen plumes left two spectacular hotspot tracks on either side of the Indian plate. With the breakup of Gondwana, India remained isolated as an island continent, but reestablished its biotic links with Africa during the Late Cretaceous during its collision with the Kohistan\xe2\x80\x93Ladakh Arc (~\xc2\xa085\xc2\xa0Ma) along the Indus Suture. Soon after the Deccan eruption, India drifted northward as an island continent by rapid motion carrying Gondwana biota, about 20\xc2\xa0cm/year, between 67\xc2\xa0Ma to 50\xc2\xa0Ma; it slowed down dramatically to 5\xc2\xa0cm/year during its collision with Asia in Early Eocene (~\xc2\xa050\xc2\xa0Ma). A northern corridor was established between India and Asia soon after the collision allowing faunal interchange. This is reflected by mixed Gondwana and Eurasian elements in the fossil record preserved in several continental Eocene formations of India. A revised India\xe2\x80\x93Asia collision model suggests that the Indus Suture represents the obduction zone between India and the Kohistan\xe2\x80\x93Ladakh Arc, whereas the Shyok-Suture represents the collision between the Kohistan\xe2\x80\x93Ladakh arc and Tibet. Eventually, the Indus\xe2\x80\x93Tsangpo Zone became the locus of the final India\xe2\x80\x93Asia collision, which probably began in Early Eocene (~\xc2\xa050\xc2\xa0Ma) with the closure of Neotethys Ocean. The post-collisional tectonics for the last 50\xc2\xa0million years is best expressed in the evolution of the Himalaya\xe2\x80\x93Tibetan orogen. The great thickness of crust beneath Tibet and Himalaya and a series of north vergent thrust zones in the Himalaya and the south-vergent subduction zones in Tibetan Plateau suggest the progressive convergence between India and Asia of about 2500\xc2\xa0km since the time of collision. In the early Eohimalayan phase (~\xc2\xa050 to 25\xc2\xa0Ma) of Himalayan orogeny (Middle Eocene\xe2\x80\x93Late Oligocene), thick sediments on the leading edge of the Indian plate were squeezed, folded, and faulted to form the Tethyan Himalaya. With continuing convergence of India, the architecture of the Himalayan\xe2\x80\x93Tibetan orogen is dominated by deformational structures developed in the Neogene Period during the Neohimalayan phase (~\xc2\xa021\xc2\xa0Ma to present), creating a series of north-vergent thrust belt systems such as the Main Central Thrust, the Main Boundary Thrust, and the Main Frontal Thrust to accommodate crustal shortening. Neogene molassic sediment shed from the rise of the Himalaya was deposited in a nearly continuous foreland trough in the Siwalik Group containing rich vertebrate assemblages. Tomographic imaging of the India\xe2\x80\x93Asia orogen reveals that Indian lithospheric slab has been subducted subhorizontally beneath the entire Tibetan Plateau that has played a key role in the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. The low-viscosity channel flow in response to topographic loading of Tibet provides a mechanism to explain the Himalayan\xe2\x80\x93Tibetan orogen. From the start of its voyage in Southern Hemisphere, to its final impact with the Asia, the Indian plate has experienced changes in climatic conditions both short-term and long-term. We present a series of paleoclimatic maps illustrating the temperature and precipitation conditions based on estimates of Fast Ocean Atmospheric Model (FOAM), a coupled global climate model. The uplift of the Himalaya\xe2\x80\x93Tibetan Plateau above the snow line created two most important global climate phenomena\xe2\x80\x94the birth of the Asian monsoon and the onset of Pleistocene glaciation. As the mountains rose, and the monsoon rains intensified, increasing erosional sediments from the Himalaya were carried down by the Ganga River in the east and the Indus River in the west, and were deposited in two great deep-sea fans, the Bengal and the Indus. Vertebrate fossils provide additional resolution for the timing of three crucial tectonic events: India\xe2\x80\x93KL Arc collision during the Late Cretaceous, India\xe2\x80\x93Asia collision during the Early Eocene, and the rise of the Himalaya during the Early Miocene.Graphical abstractDownload full-size imageHighlights\xe2\x96\xba India made the longest voyage of all drifting continents, ~\xc2\xa09,000\xc2\xa0kilometers. \xe2\x96\xba India showed 7 episodes of continental flood volcanism and rifting from Gondwana. \xe2\x96\xba India collided with the Kohistan-Ladakh Arc in the Late Cretaceous. \xe2\x96\xba India collided with Asia in Early Eocene to create the Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau. \xe2\x96\xba Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau orogen is dominated by channel flow extrusion.'

Title: 'The taxonomic distribution of invasive angiosperm plants: Ecological insights and comparison to agricultural weeds'
Author: 'Curtis C.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320797000967
Abstract: "AbstractGlobal data sets of serious agricultural weeds (1348 species), widespread agricultural weeds (1041 species), and threatening natural area invaders (381 species) were assembled, and taxonomic patterns among these data sets were compared to gain insights into how these groups differ ecologically. Angiosperm taxonomic groups (families, orders and subclasses) were tested for over- and under-representation using resampling tests, and ecological characteristics of plant families were correlated with the prominence of each family in the data sets. As predicted by Baker's previously proposed attributes of \xe2\x80\x98ideal\xe2\x80\x99 weeds, many over-represented families among agricultural weeds contained primarily herbaceous, rapidly reproducing, abiotically dispersed species. The natural area invaders, in contrast, were represented by a more ecologically diverse range of families and were over-represented by more largely woody families. Families with at least some abiotically pollinated species averaged significantly higher proportions of natural area invaders (p = 0\xc2\xb7001) and agricultural weeds (p < 0\xc2\xb7001) than biotically pollinated families. Families containing climbing species were more highly represented among natural area invaders than families without climbers (p < 0\xc2\xb7009). While all non-native plants may carry some risk of becoming natural area invaders, this taxonomic analysis suggests that plants with amongst the highest risk of becoming natural area invaders worldwide include: species that are primarily aquatic or semi-aquatic, grasses, nitrogen-fixers, climbers, and clonal trees. Only 25% of natural area invaders were serious agricultural weeds, so quarantine legislation aimed at curbing the introduction of new agricultural weeds will be unlikely to prevent the introduction of most natural area invaders."

Title: 'Golden bowerbird (Prionodura newtonia) habitat in past, present and future climates: predicted extinction of a vertebrate in tropical highlands due to global warming'
Author: 'David W.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320703002301
Abstract: 'AbstractA generalised linear model was used to predict climatically suitable habitat for the golden bowerbird (Prionodura newtonia De Vis), an endemic species of the Wet Tropics of North Queensland. Mean temperature of the coldest quarter and mean precipitation of the wettest quarter were found to be the best habitat predictors. For independent validation data, accuracy was 67% (Kappa statistic, n=30). Past, and future habitats suitable to the golden bowerbird were mapped by altering the temperature and precipitation input to the model. In the current climate, total potential habitat is estimated to be 1564 km2, occurring as a number of separate patches with distinct bowerbird subpopulations. Past habitat was most limiting, 406 km2, during the Holocene climatic optimum (c. 5000\xe2\x80\x933600 YBP, +2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C and +50% rainfall relative to today). With future warming, assuming a 10% decrease in rainfall, potential habitat is reduced to 582 km2 (1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C warming), 163 km2 (2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C warming) and 37 km2 (3\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C warming). Thus, global warming in the coming decades is likely to be a significant threat to the survival of this and similar upland and highland species in the tropics.'

Title: 'OpinionAddressing the threat to biodiversity from botanic gardens'
Author: 'Philip E.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534711000206
Abstract: 'Increasing evidence highlights the role that botanic gardens might have in plant invasions across the globe. Botanic gardens, often in global biodiversity hotspots, have been implicated in the early cultivation and/or introduction of most environmental weeds listed by IUCN as among the worst invasive species worldwide. Furthermore, most of the popular ornamental species in living collections around the globe have records as alien weeds. Voluntary codes of conduct to prevent the dissemination of invasive plants from botanic gardens have had limited uptake, with few risk assessments undertaken of individual living collections. A stronger global networking of botanic gardens to tackle biological invasions involving public outreach, information sharing and capacity building is a priority to prevent the problems of the past occurring in the future.'

Title: 'Importance of non-timber forest products in the economic valuation of dry deciduous forests of India'
Author: 'Ajay Kumar'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389934104000231
Abstract: 'AbstractThe production and marketing of non-timber goods (NTFP) and services gained importance in forest management as demand for these increased considerably. However, due to lack of relevant information on the level of output of non-timber products, its economic significance was seldom accounted for in the valuation of forests. Dry deciduous forests in India is one such typical case where forest valuation is yet to integrate the NTFP stock, widely used for subsistence and cash income. A detailed accounting of commercially valuable forest products harvested from dry deciduous forests of Eastern India was made to highlight the economic worth of forests and contribution of NTFPs. The net present value of revenues from NTFP was estimated to be US$ 1016 ha\xe2\x88\x921 in the coastal area and US$ 1348/ha in the inland area, which proved to be significantly higher than the returns from alternative land uses. Dry deciduous forests were estimated to have more value than had been assumed previously and compared favourably against potential timber revenue (US$ 268 ha\xe2\x88\x921). The result indicates the necessity of developing a new valuation protocol for use by forest managers while deciding conversion of forest lands for non-forestry purposes.'

Abstract: 'AbstractCoastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification was issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forest of Government of India in February 1991 as a part of the Environmental Protection Act of 1986 to protect the coast from eroding and to preserve its natural resources. The initial notification did not distinguish the variability and diversity of various coastal states before enforcing it on the various states and Union Territories. Impact assessments were not carried out to assess its impact on socio-economic life of the coastal population. For the very same reason, it was unnoticed or rather ignored till 1994 when the Supreme Court of India made a land mark judgment on the fate of the coastal aquaculture which by then had established as an economically successful industry in many South Indian States. Coastal aquaculture in its modern form was a prohibited activity within CRZ. Lately, only various stakeholders of the coast realized the real impact of the CRZ rules on their property rights and business. To overcome the initial drawbacks several amendments were made in the regulation to suit regional needs.In 1995, another great transformation took place in the State of Kerala as a part of the re-organization of the local self government institutions into a decentralized three tier system called \xe2\x80\x9cPanchayathi Raj System\xe2\x80\x9d. In 1997, the state government also decided to transfer the power with the required budget outlay to the grass root level panchayats (villages) and municipalities to plan and implement the various projects in their localities with the full participation of the local people by constituting Grama Sabhas (Peoples\xe2\x80\x99 Forum). It is called the \xe2\x80\x9cPeoples\xe2\x80\x99 Planning Campaign\xe2\x80\x9d(Peoples\xe2\x80\x99 Participatory Programme\xe2\x80\x94PPP for Local Level Self-Governance). The management of all the resources including the local natural resources was largely decentralized to the level of local communities and villages. Integrated, sustainable coastal zone management has become the concern of the local population.The paper assesses the socio-economic impact of the centrally enforced CRZ and the state sponsored PPP on the coastal community in Kerala and suggests measures to improve the system and living standards of the coastal people within the framework of CRZ.'

Title: 'Rapid assessment of biological richness in a part of Eastern Himalaya: an integrated three-tier approach'
Author: 'M.D.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112704008187
Abstract: "AbstractBiodiversity conservation necessitates not only preservation of single or multiple species but also the habitat as a whole along with its environment. Biological richness (BR) is a cumulative property of an ecological habitat and its surrounding environment, which has emerging implications in terms of management and planning. Six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical and ecological) were linked together based on their relative importance to qualitatively stratify biological richness of forest vegetation in Subansiri district of Eastern Himalaya using customized software, Bio_CAP. Higher biological richness was assigned to the habitats with (i) high species diversity, (ii) high degree of ecosystem uniqueness (EU), (iii) high economical value, (iv) complex terrain and (v) low disturbance level. This simple idea of integrated \xe2\x80\x98three-tier modeling approach\xe2\x80\x99 of (i) utilization of geospatial tools, (ii) limited field survey and (iii) landscape analysis; formed the basis of rapid assessment of biological richness.Satellite image interpretation using hybrid classification approach provided spatial distribution of vegetation types (corresponding to ecological habitats), with 89% accuracy. Landscape analysis was done using various quantitative indices that measured the heterogeneity and evaluated the patch characteristics. A methodology was developed for deriving relative adjacency weights from field data for calculation of juxtaposition of vegetation types. Biotic disturbance buffers (i.e., proximity zones around roads and human settlements) along with landscape parameters were combined to calculate disturbance index (DI), which in turn became an intermediate surrogate for BR assessment. Species diversity patterns along fragmentation and biotic disturbance gradients were adjudged to derive relative weights for DI computation. Species diversity (Shannon's index), ecosystem uniqueness (endemism status) and biodiversity value (BV) (total importance value (TIV)) were enumerated quantitatively that provided relative weights for BR computation. Terrain complexity (TC) was generated by calculating variance of the elevation image. Fifty-nine of total 764 species were found endemic to Eastern Himalaya with over all species endemism of 13 per ha. Shannon's index increased with decrease in fragmentation levels and increase of distance from sources of disturbance. BR index of the district was presented in five qualitative levels. Subtropical forests claim highest degree of biological richness as well as high disturbance index. This methodology has implications for rapid biodiversity assessment. Forest managers can use the DI and BR maps for gap analysis and prioritization of conservation activities viz., introduction of locale-specific species, thus protecting the forest habitats in situ."

Title: 'ReviewChallenges in developing medicinal plant databases for sharing ethnopharmacological knowledge'
Author: 'Sanjoy Singh'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874112001389
Abstract: 'AbstractEthnopharmacological relevanceMajor research contributions in ethnopharmacology have generated vast amount of data associated with medicinal plants. Computerized databases facilitate data management and analysis making coherent information available to researchers, planners and other users. Web-based databases also facilitate knowledge transmission and feed the circle of information exchange between the ethnopharmacological studies and public audience. However, despite the development of many medicinal plant databases, a lack of uniformity is still discernible. Therefore, it calls for defining a common standard to achieve the common objectives of ethnopharmacology.Aim of the studyThe aim of the study is to review the diversity of approaches in storing ethnopharmacological information in databases and to provide some minimal standards for these databases.Materials and methodsSurvey for articles on medicinal plant databases was done on the Internet by using selective keywords. Grey literatures and printed materials were also searched for information. Listed resources were critically analyzed for their approaches in content type, focus area and software technology.ResultsNecessity for rapid incorporation of traditional knowledge by compiling primary data has been felt. While citation collection is common approach for information compilation, it could not fully assimilate local literatures which reflect traditional knowledge. Need for defining standards for systematic evaluation, checking quality and authenticity of the data is felt. Databases focussing on thematic areas, viz., traditional medicine system, regional aspect, disease and phytochemical information are analyzed. Issues pertaining to data standard, data linking and unique identification need to be addressed in addition to general issues like lack of update and sustainability. In the background of the present study, suggestions have been made on some minimum standards for development of medicinal plant database.ConclusionIn spite of variations in approaches, existence of many overlapping features indicates redundancy of resources and efforts. As the development of global data in a single database may not be possible in view of the culture-specific differences, efforts can be given to specific regional areas. Existing scenario calls for collaborative approach for defining a common standard in medicinal plant database for knowledge sharing and scientific advancement.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (133KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Managing mistletoes: The value of local practices for a non-timber forest resource'
Author: 'Lucy'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112707008973
Abstract: 'AbstractSustainable harvesting of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and associated livelihood security can be affected by forest disturbances additional to harvesting. Amla (Phyllanthus emblica and Phyllanthus indofischeri) is a locally and nationally significant NTFP in India, exploited for its fruit. We examined the infection of these two species by a hemiparasitic mistletoe and investigated two alternative management approaches.Forest surveys, mistletoe removal experiments and seed deposition surveys were employed to assess the prevalence of mistletoe infection, characteristics of infection in relation to resource value and the appropriateness of local versus institutional management approaches. The results suggest mistletoe infection is widespread in the study site, affecting over half of the Amla population, and in particular those reproductive trees important for population persistence. Infection characteristics and resource values differ between the two Phyllanthus species, having significant implications for Amla collectors. Institutional perspectives on the management of this species conflict with local practice. Cutting of branches by collectors has previously been considered destructive, but may in fact have management benefits in terms of increased productivity through re-sprouts and reduced risk of mistletoe infection. However, neither mistletoe removal by hand, nor branch cutting appear to offer a viable control strategy in isolation. A multifarious strategy including new approaches to management is needed to safeguard the role of this resource in local livelihoods.'

Title: 'A molecular phylogeny of the Littorininae (Gastropoda: Littorinidae): unequal evolutionary rates, morphological parallelism, and biogeography of the Southern Ocean'
Author: 'S.T.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790303000381
Abstract: 'AbstractA molecular phylogeny is presented for the subfamily Littorininae (including representatives of all subgeneric taxa and all members of a group of southern-temperate species formerly classified as \xe2\x80\x98Nodilittorina\xe2\x80\x99), based on sequence data from two nuclear (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA) and two mitochondrial (12S rRNA, CO1) genes. The phylogeny shows considerable disagreement with earlier hypotheses derived from morphological data. In particular, \xe2\x80\x98Nodilittorina\xe2\x80\x99 is polyphyletic and is here divided into four genera (Echinolittorina, Austrolittorina, Afrolittorina new genus, and the monotypic Nodilittorina s.s.). The phylogenetic relationships of \xe2\x80\x98Littorina\xe2\x80\x99 striata have been controversial and it is here transferred to the genus Tectarius, a surprising relationship for which there is little morphological support. The relationships of the enigmatic Mainwaringia remain poorly resolved, but it is not a basal member of the subfamily. The two living species of Mainwaringia are remarkable for a greatly elevated rate of evolution in all four genes examined; it is suggested that this may be connected with their protandrous hermaphroditism, which is unique in the family. The molecular phylogeny provides a new framework for the adaptive radiation of the Littorininae, showing more frequent shifts between habitats and climatic regimes than previously suspected, and striking parallelism of morphological characters. The fossil record of littorinids is poor, but ages of clades are estimated using a calibration based on a Lower Eocene age of the genus Littoraria. Using these estimates, the antitropical distribution of Littorina and Afrolittorina is an ancient pattern of possibly Cretaceous age. The five members of Austrolittorina show a Gondwanan distribution in Australia, New Zealand, and South America. Based on the morphological uniformity within this clade, relatively recent (Plio-Pleistocene) trans-Pacific dispersal events seemed a likely explanation, as proposed for numerous other congeneric marine taxa. However, molecular estimation of ages of divergence suggest an initial vicariance between Australian and South American lineages at 40\xe2\x80\x9373\xc2\xa0Ma, contemporary with the later stages of fragmentation of the Gondwanan supercontinent, followed by more recent (but still mid-Cenozoic) dispersal events across the Tasman Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Afrolittorina is another Cretaceous clade, now restricted to southern Africa and southern Australia, but divergence between these lineages (29\xe2\x80\x9355\xc2\xa0Ma) post-dates Gondwanan fragmentation. Within both Austrolittorina and Afrolittorina all sister-species divergences are estimated to fall in the range 10\xe2\x80\x9347\xc2\xa0Ma, so that there is no evidence for speciation events in the Plio-Pleistocene.'

Abstract: "AbstractSustainable agriculture is vital in today's world as it offers the potential to meet our agricultural needs, something that conventional agriculture fails to do. This type of agriculture uses a special farming technique wherein the environmental resources can be fully utilized and at the same time ensuring that no harm was done to it. Thus the technique is environment friendly and ensures safe and healthy agricultural products. Microbial populations are instrumental to fundamental processes that drive stability and productivity of agro-ecosystems. Several investigations addressed at improving understanding of the diversity, dynamics and importance of soil microbial communities and their beneficial and co-operative roles in agricultural productivity. However, in this review we describe only the contributions of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and cyanobacteria in safe and sustainable agriculture development.Research highlights\xe2\x96\xba An ideal agricultural system is sustainable, maintains and improves human health, benefits environment and produces enough food for increasing world population. \xe2\x96\xba The utilization of biofertlizers can decrease the use of urea-N, prevent the depletion of soil organic matter and reduce environmental pollution to a considerable extent. \xe2\x96\xba Cyanobacteria and PGPR are excellent model systems which can provide the biotechnologist with novel genetic constituents and bioactive compounds having diverse uses in agriculture and environmental sustainability.\xe2\x96\xba PGPR and cyanobacteria offer an environmentally sustainable approach to increase crop production and soil health."

Abstract: 'AbstractEthnopharmacological relevanceIt is becoming increasingly clear that ethnopharmacology cannot be disassociated from food production, human nutrition and the conservation of the biodiversity that constitutes its resource base.Aim of the studyThis paper aims to provide a perspective of ethnopharmacology that explicitly extends the range of disciplines it covers so as to embrace food and nutrition and the biodiversity basis, both wild and agricultural, and also places it in the context of the dramatic changes to our planet that we are experiencing during a period of rapid global change and the impacts that these changes are having on human health and nutrition and on its resource base.Materials and methodsA review is made of recent initiatives and developments that show linkages between ethnopharmacology, agriculture, food production, nutrition and biodiversity conservation.ResultsEthnopharmacology, biodiversity, agriculture, food and nutrition are inextricably linked but suffer from compartmentalization and a lack of communication which have to be overcome if progress is to be made. Fortunately, a convergence of interest between the agricultural biodiversity and the biodiversity conservation sectors has emerged in recent years and there is an increased appreciation of the need to adopt a wider approach to human nutrition than the conventional agricultural model allows; there is also a greater awareness of the important role played by diversity of crops, especially local species, and consumption of wild species in achieving balanced nutrition. An increased recognition of the key role of local communities in managing agricultural biodiversity is evident. While ethnopharmacologists have expressed concern at the relentless loss of biodiversity, there has been little direct involvement but it is perhaps now time to consider a more proactive role. Attention is also drawn to the need to assess the implications of global change for ethnopharmacology.ConclusionsEthnopharmacologists need to take much more cognizance of the fate of the resource base \xe2\x80\x93 the plants, animals and microorganisms \xe2\x80\x93 and of the actions being undertaken under the auspices of treaties, such as the Conservation on Biological Diversity and its Global Strategy for Plant Conservation, and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, to counter its degradation and loss. In addition, they should play a more active role in determining the actions needed to assess, monitor and conserve the resource base. Although it has been suggested that the \xe2\x80\x98golden days\xe2\x80\x99 of ethnopharmacology may be over, it is proposed that by embracing the challenges of broadening the remit so as to include the health aspects of wild biodiversity employed in nutrition, a new \xe2\x80\x98golden age\xe2\x80\x99 beckons.

Title: 'Phylogeographic pattern of the European forest grass species Hordelymus europaeus: cpDNA evidence'
Author: 'Hana'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0367253009001625
Abstract: 'AbstractThe phylogeographical structure of the European forest grass Hordelymus europaeus (Poaceae) was studied by sequencing three non-coding regions of chloroplast DNA. Forty-three populations within the entire natural distribution area were analysed. The greatest haplotype variation and divergence were revealed on Balkan and Apennine Peninsula, suggesting main glacial refugia in these regions. Among southern refugia, probably only the Balkans could have remarkably contributed to postglacial re-colonisation of the northern parts of Europe. A distinctly different haplotype group found on the Crimean Peninsula and in central Italy may represent either relicts of a previously more widespread ancestor or result of long-distance dispersal. The phylogeographical pattern found in H. europaeus is to certain extent similar with that found in Fagus sylvatica. This might imply a partly common postglacial colonisation history of these ecologically narrowly tied species. Nevertheless, unlike in the case of F. sylvatica, we did not found convincing evidence for the existence of Central European glacial refugia for H. europaeus.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We detected FSGS in 15 dipterocarps of 19 species across four forest sites.\xe2\x80\xa2GLS models are used to develop indirect operational indicators of FSGS.\xe2\x80\xa2Wood density and flower size offer useful indicators of FSGS.\xe2\x80\xa2We proposed simple guidelines to allow forest managers to account for FSGS.\xe2\x80\xa2There is an urge to implement forest management with species specific guidelines.AbstractThe lowland tropical forests of Southeast Asia are dominated by a single family of canopy and emergent trees, the Dipterocarpaceae. The seeds of dipterocarps are gravity or gyration dispersed. Short distance and limited seed dispersal via these mechanisms result in the aggregation of related individuals and strong fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS). In logged and fragmented forests, where gene flow may be disrupted, tree species with strong FSGS are predicted to exhibit increased inbreeding, which consequently can erode genetic diversity, fitness and might limit the potential for natural regeneration of dipterocarps. Developing a set of indirect operational indicators for FSGS provides a solid basis for informing conservation and management of forest genetic resources in logged forests. Our main objective was to use an information theoretic approach to identify these indicators of FSGS in dipterocarps. We quantify FSGS in 19 dipterocarp species across four forest sites in Malaysian Borneo, India and the Seychelles. We detected FSGS in 15 (79%) of our study species, most of which displayed significant inbreeding. Our results suggest that wood density and flower size offer useful indicators of FSGS. We propose some simple guidelines to allow forest managers to account for FSGS when planning approaches to maintain genetically diverse stands in logged dipterocarp forests. The integration of improved understanding of genetic processes is essential for conserving forest tree genetic resources and ensuring the resilience of logged forests.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe early developmental biology of seven species of Indian podostemads based on in vitro growth of plants from seeds is discussed. Unpublished observations on seed germination, destiny of the radicular pole of the embryo, origin of the \xe2\x80\x98primary axis\xe2\x80\x99, location of the site of initiation of the thallus, and variations in seedling morphology in three thalloid members of the subfamily Podostemoideae (Zeylanidium lichenoides (S. Kurz) Engler, Hydrobryopsis sessilis (Willis) Engl., Willisia selaginoides (Bedd.) Warming ex Willis) are communicated. Additional observations are added to previously published accounts of the seedling biology of the thalloid Cladopus hookerianus (Tul.) C. Cusset and Polypleurum stylosum (Wight) Hall (Podostemoideae) and one thalloid Tristichoideae (Dalzellia ceylanica (Gardn.) Wight).Special attention is focused on the sequence of developmental events from seed to flowering in Indotristicha ramosissima (Wight) Van Royen (Tristichoideae), the only Indian species that seems to correspond to the Classical Root Shoot (CRS) model. In I. ramosissima exogenous root primordia arise from the flattened radicle, of which only three develop into main roots with asymmetric root caps. Although the mature seed lacks a plumule, a \xe2\x80\x98primary axis\xe2\x80\x99 of limited growth is formed at the apex. The plant body, with its numerous long branches, develops from the main roots. Flowering has been stimulated by subjecting vegetative plants to water and nutrient stress.Comparisons are made of early seedling developmental patterns among the seven investigated species. Special attention is focused on determining at what stage in ontogeny the root-shoot versus thalloid growth forms diverge. A model of seedling development is presented that depicts interspecific variability among species examined. The homology of the thallus in Podostemaceae remains unclear.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We provide a continuous history of the ISM in the Bengal region for the last 18\xc2\xa0ka.\xe2\x80\xa2Precipitation and vegetation are reconstructed from alkane \xce\xb4D and \xce\xb413C composition.\xe2\x80\xa2Paleo-precipitation \xce\xb4D was driven by the amount effect reflecting monsoon intensity.\xe2\x80\xa2Paleo-vegetation composition was driven by precipitation variability since 15\xc2\xa0ka\xc2\xa0BP.\xe2\x80\xa2Comparison with numerical model results suggests coherent regional ISM variability.AbstractThe Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) is a major global climatic phenomenon. Long-term precipitation proxy records of the ISM, however, are often fragmented and discontinuous, impeding an estimation of the magnitude of precipitation variability from the Last Glacial to the present. To improve our understanding of past ISM variability, we provide a continuous reconstructed record of precipitation and continental vegetation changes from the lower Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna catchment and the Indo-Burman ranges over the last 18,000 years (18\xc2\xa0ka). The records derive from a marine sediment core from the northern Bay of Bengal (NBoB), and are complemented by numerical model results of spatial moisture transport and precipitation distribution over the Bengal region. The isotopic composition of terrestrial plant waxes (\xce\xb4D and \xce\xb413C of n-alkanes) are compared to results from an isotope-enabled general atmospheric circulation model (IsoCAM) for selected time slices (pre-industrial, mid-Holocene and Heinrich Stadial 1). Comparison of proxy and model results indicate that past changes in the \xce\xb4D of precipitation and plant waxes were mainly driven by the amount effect, and strongly influenced by ISM rainfall. Maximum precipitation is detected for the Early Holocene Climatic Optimum (EHCO; 10.5\xe2\x80\x936\xc2\xa0ka\xc2\xa0BP), whereas minimum precipitation occurred during the Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1; 16.9\xe2\x80\x9315.4\xc2\xa0ka\xc2\xa0BP). The IsoCAM model results support the hypothesis of a constant moisture source (i.e. the NBoB) throughout the study period. Relative to the pre-industrial period the model reconstructions show 20% more rain during the mid-Holocene (6\xc2\xa0ka\xc2\xa0BP) and 20% less rain during the Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1), respectively. A shift from C4-plant dominated ecosystems during the glacial to subsequent C3/C4-mixed ones during the interglacial took place. Vegetation changes were predominantly driven by precipitation variability, as evidenced by the significant correlation between the \xce\xb4D and \xce\xb413C alkane records. When compared to other records across the ISM domain, precipitation and vegetation changes inferred from our records and the numerical model results provide evidence for a coherent regional variability of the ISM from the Last Glacial to the present.'

Title: 'Harvesting techniques, hemiparasites and fruit production in two non-timber forest tree species in south India'
Author: 'Aditi'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112701007472
Abstract: 'AbstractIncreasing demands for non-timber forest products and their commercial extractions can result in harvesting methods that maximize short term economic gains with little attention to long term ecological consequences. We assessed the ecological impacts of harvesting techniques used by an indigenous group, the Soligas, on the non-timber forest products they extract from the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills, south India. Specifically, we examined patterns of resource availability of two non-timber tree species, Phyllanthus emblica and P. indofischeri, and how the current fruit harvesting techniques influence fruit yields, and susceptibility of trees to infestations by hemiparasitic plants of the Loranthaceae family. We also assessed how hemiparasite infestations affect fruit production and growth rates of Phyllanthus trees. There was considerable variation in fruit production in both species of Phyllanthus from one fruiting season to the next. The Soligas harvest an average of 86% (\xc2\xb117.72%) of the fruit yield on a per tree basis in P. emblica and 94.17% (\xc2\xb16.9%) in the case of P. indofischeri. At the population level, 64.75 and 86.6% of the fruit productivity is harvested in P. emblica and P. indofischeri, respectively. However, not all individuals or populations are harvested. Harvesting techniques used resulted in cutting of 15% of P. indofischeri trees and 5% of P. emblica trees. The current harvesting techniques used by the Soligas reduce fruit production in P. emblica in the following year (R2=0.27,p=0.03). Furthermore, the Soligas selectively harvest fruits from trees that have larger fruit crop sizes in both species. Individual trees that carried a greater load of hemiparasites produced significantly lower fruit yields (P. emblica: r=\xe2\x88\x920.32,p<0.013; P. indofischeri: r=\xe2\x88\x920.73,p<0.001). The presence of hemiparasites significantly affected the growth rates of trees.Current harvesting techniques used by the Soligas have negative impacts on trees of Phyllanthus spp., as do infestations by hemiparasites. Current fruit harvesting strategies and techniques used by the Soligas focus on maximizing the economic returns by adopting methods of extraction such as lopping of branches and cutting of trees. Such practices can ultimately decrease the rates at which the populations grow, thereby making the extraction of Phyllanthus fruits unsustainable. Adopting more sustainable methods of harvesting appears to be one viable solution to the current ecological problem facing the conservation of Phyllanthus trees in the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills.'

Abstract: 'AbstractInterspecific variation in water-induced fluctuations in stem girth demonstrates the mechanisms promoting coexistence in seasonally dry tropical forest. In addition, these fluctuations are a potential, but unevaluated, source of bias in measurements of annual tree growth rates. To examine diurnal and seasonal patterns of stem diameter change, tree girth was measured over 2 years (1997\xe2\x80\x931999), using dendrometer bands, for three species (Celtis mildbraedii, C. zenkeri and Strombosia glaucescens) in semi-deciduous forest in Ghana. Soil matric potential was measured concurrently at 15\xc2\xa0cm depth. In addition, measurements of all trees >20\xc2\xa0cm dbh on three, 1\xc2\xa0ha plots were made at the beginning and middle of the 1998/1999 dry season. During the severe 1997/1998 dry season, soil matric potential declined below \xe2\x88\x921.5\xc2\xa0MPa and two species showed significant stem shrinkage. For the evergreen species, C. mildbraedii, there was a significant positive effect of tree diameter on stem shrinkage, and shrinkage was greater in the second, compared to the first, half of the dry season. For the deciduous species, C. zenkeri, shrinkage was reduced during the second half of the dry season, following leaf fall. During 1998/1999, soil matric potential, did not decline below \xe2\x88\x921.5\xc2\xa0MPa, and rates of girth change remained positive for all species. There were no significant effects of size or phenology on the rate of girth change in the plot-based study. Deviations in annual increment calculated over successive monthly intervals indicate that a 10-fold difference in soil water availability between measurement occasions can lead to a 4% bias in estimates of annual growth. Measurements of forest plots should be made when inter-annual variation in soil water availability is low. In this forest, measurements should, therefore, be made during the wet season, contrary to published recommendations.'

Abstract: 'AbstractFine litterfall and nutrient return patterns were studied in three subtropical humid forest stands (7-, 13- and 16-year old), regrowing after selective tree cutting in north-eastern India. The seasonality of fine litterfall was unimodal, with a peak during spring and a trough during rainy season in the forest regrowths of three different ages. The rate of fine litterfall increased with increasing basal area of the woody vegetation during forest regrowth. Leaf litter accounted for 83% of the total litterfall. N concentration was maximum during autumn and minimum during rainy season; nutrient concentrations were highest in the leaf litter. Seasonal variation in P concentration was small. Maximum and minimum input of N and P to the forest floor through fine litter coincided with the respective periods of litter production.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe aim of this research was to study the forest community structure, tree species diversity and biomass production of a tropical seasonal rain forest in Xishuangbanna, southwest China. The community structure showed a diversified species composition and supported many species of economic significance. This tropical rain forest is closely related to Malaysian forests. The biomass and its distribution were studied using standard regression analysis and the clear-cut method for shrubs and herbs. The total biomass was 360.9t/ha and its allocation in different layers was: tree layer 352.5t/ha, shrub layer 4.7t/ha, liana 3.1t/ha and herb layer 0.5t/ha. Most of the biomass was concentrated in the trees: stem 241.2t/ha, root 69.6t/ha, branch 37.2t/ha and leaves 4.3t/ha; The DBH class allocation of the tree biomass was concentrated in the middle DBH class. The biomass of six DBH classes from 20 to 80cm was 255.4t/ha. There are twenty-six species with biomass over 0.5% of the total biomass of the tree layer, and three species with biomass over 5%, i.e., Pometia tomentosa, Barringtonia macrostachya (5.4%) and Terminalia myriocarpa (5.2%). Data on stem, branch, leaves and root of the individual tree species were used to develop regression models. D2H was found to be the best estimator of the biomass in this tropical rain forest.However, higher biomass figures have been reported from tropical forests elsewhere e.g., 415\xe2\x80\x93520t/ha in the tropical forests of Cambodia, the tropical moist mixed dipterocarp forests, and the tropical moist logged moist evergreen-high, medium, and low yield forests of SriLanka. In some forests, lower accumulation of biomass was reported, e.g., 10\xe2\x80\x93295t/ha in the tropical moist forests of Bangladesh, the tropical moist dense forest of Cambodia, the tropical dry forests of India, the tropical moist forests of Penninsular-Malaysia, the tropical moist mixed dipterocarps forests of Sarawak-Malaysia, the tropical evergreen forests of Myanmar and the tropical moist ever-green logged forests of SriLanka.'

Title: 'ReviewForest dynamics after selective timber harvesting in Papua New Guinea'

Abstract: 'AbstractForest dynamics after timber harvesting is a major issue for tropical forest managers and communities. Timber harvesting provides income to communities and governments and resources to industry but it has also been identified as a potential contributor to deforestation and degradation of tropical forests. In Papua New Guinea (PNG) harvesting is primarily occurring in accessible primary forests however, the fate of these forests under current harvesting practices is poorly understood.In this study we investigated the impacts of selective harvesting on stand structure, growth and dynamics, recovery and degradation, and species diversity. We also assessed the impacts of forest fire after the 1997\xe2\x80\x9398 El Nino on basal area (BA) growth and mortality rates of natural tropical forests in PNG. For this study we used data from 118 (105 in selectively harvested and 13 in un-harvested forest), one-hectare permanent sample plots distributed across the country and measured for over 15\xc2\xa0years by the PNG Forest Research Institute (PNGFRI). We analysed data from 84 of these plots in harvested forest to examine temporal trends in stand condition following harvesting. Mortality rates were investigated in 10 of the 21 plots in harvested forest that were burned during the 1997\xe2\x80\x9398 El Nino drought with sufficient data for analyses. We tested a model developed in Queensland tropical forests to determine whether or not a critical threshold residual BA existed for the recovery of harvested tropical forests in PNG. Results from a logarithmic regression analysis of the relationship between starting BA (BA at first census) and stand BA increment after selective harvesting showed a positive increase in BA growth (r2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.74, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). However, there was no critical threshold in residual BA that determined whether a harvested forest was likely to degrade or recover BA growth after harvesting. Our analyses suggested that the response to harvesting was variable, with the majority of un-burned plots (75%) showing an increase in BA and remainder a decrease. Average BA of selectively-harvested tropical forests was about 17\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa04.17 (SD). Average annual increment in BA across the 84 un-burned plots was 0.17\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.62 (SD). Thus these forests generally show capacity to recover after selective harvesting even when the residual BA is low. A proportion of the BA increment is made up of non-commercial pioneer species that originate in significant gaps after harvesting. On burned plots, BA is affected by high mortality rates. The fate of these forests will depend on the degree of future harvesting, potential conversion to agriculture and the impact of fire and other disturbances.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Basal area and timber volume are generally increasing after harvesting. \xe2\x96\xba El Nino forest fires affected BA growth and mortality was high on 10% of plots. \xe2\x96\xba Assisted regeneration will assist recovery in sites with declining BA. \xe2\x96\xba Smaller-scale harvesting is required for management of harvested forests in PNG.'

Title: 'Phylogenetic relationships of African microhylid frogs inferred from DNA sequences of mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA genes'
Author: 'Simon P.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439609204000480
Abstract: 'AbstractThe phylogenetic relationships of microhylid frogs are poorly understood. The first molecular phylogeny for continental African microhylids is presented, including representatives of all subfamilies, six of the eight genera, and the enigmatic hemisotid Hemisus. Mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA sequence data were analysed using parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian methods. Analyses of the data are consistent with the monophyly of all sampled subfamilies and genera. Hemisus does not nest within either brevicipitines or non-brevicipitines. It is possibly the sister group to brevicipitines, in which case brevicipitines might not be microhylids. Phrynomantis and Hoplophryne potentially group with non-African, non-brevicipitine microhylids, in agreement with recent morphological and molecular data. Within brevicipitines, Breviceps is recovered as the sister group to a clade of Callulina+Spelaeophryne+Probreviceps. The relationships among the genera within this latter clade are unclear, being sensitive to the method of analysis. Optimal trees suggest the Probreviceps macrodactylus subspecies complex might be paraphyletic with respect to P. uluguruensis, corroborating preliminary morphological studies indicating that P. m. rungwensis may be a distinct species. P. m. loveridgei may be paraphyletic with respect to P. m. macrodactylus, though this is not strongly supported. Some biogeographic hypotheses are examined in light of these findings.'

Title: 'Palaeoenvironments of the dinosaur-bearing Lameta Beds (Maastrichtian), Narmada Valley, Central India'
Author: 'S.K.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003101829400128U
Abstract: 'AbstractThe Maastrichtian Lameta Beds of central India are intimately associated with the Deccan lavas and are critical to determining Upper Cretaceous palaeoenvironments and palaeogeography of the area. In the type Jabalpur sub-region, four mappable units of the Lameta Beds are recognised. The basal Green Sandstone is interpreted as a braided stream deposit. The Lower Limestone, characterised by brecciation and shrinkage cracks, is interpreted as a sub-aerially exposed palustrine flat with calcrete formation occurring on topographic highs of low relief plains. The overlying Mottled Nodular Beds exhibit a variable range of calcrete fabrics and morphologies including circum-granular and linear cracks, root casts and nodules. These are interpreted as pedogenically modified sheet wash deposits of a semiarid alluvial plain. The Upper Sandstone is a sheet flood deposit, again pedogenically modified before arrival of the basal lava flows. Overall the Lameta beds are considered to represent a regionally extensive Maastrichtian regolith.Carbon and oxygen isotope analyses of calcareous components are entirely consistent with soil-zone environments. The \xce\xb413C values are low, typically \xe2\x88\x928 to \xe2\x88\x929\xe2\x80\xb0 PDB, demonstrating a strong input of carbon from the decay of terrestrial land plants. Calcrete \xce\xb418O values are variable, \xe2\x88\x925 to \xe2\x88\x9210\xe2\x80\xb0 PDB consistent with precipitation from meteoric water, some of which was evaporatively modified in pools on the alluvial/palustrine flat.The Lameta Beds are well known for sauropod nesting sites and sedimentological analyses of these sites suggest that the animals selected topographic highs, usually in marly or sandy, soft sediment. Multiple nests with similar egg types probably indicate colonial nesting. Isotopic analyses of eggshell carbonate agree with earlier work suggesting that the sauropods ate a \xe2\x80\x9cC3\xe2\x80\x9d plant food.'

Title: 'Global patterns in the establishment and distribution of exotic birds'
Author: 'Ted J.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320796000195
Abstract: "AbstractI use three separate data bases to examine recipient community and site factors that might be influencing the establishment, persistence, and distribution of avian exotics. All in all, about half the variance between islands/regions in their numbers of successfully and unsuccessfully introduced species can be accounted for by recipient site-specific variables; the most important correlate of success is the number of native species extinctions over about the last 3000 years, which reflects the degree of human activity and habitat destruction and deterioration through intrusions of exotic predators, herbivores, and parasites. Consequently, the number of exotic species gained is close to the number of species lost through extinction. Even after controlling for avian extinctions, island area correlates positively with introduced species number. Invasion success does not decline significantly with the richness of the native avifauna (after controlling for the effects of extinctions and island area) nor the variety of potential mammalian predators. The relative proportion of extinct native species across islands/regions is negatively correlated with area and positively correlated with introduced species number and the number of endemic species. A strong correlation exists between the number of successes and the number of failures, attesting to the role of persistent acclimatization societies in increasing species numbers despite high failure rates. The relative success to failure rate increases with the number of extinct native species. The correlation between introductions and native extinctions seems to arise because native birds are usually more common, if not restricted, to native habitats while introduced birds are primary occupants of disturbed and open habitats. As more of an island's area is converted to urban, agricultural and disturbed habitats or altered through the introduction of herbivores and exotic predators, most natives lose good living space while most introduced birds, that frequent open and disturbed areas and have evolved in predator-rich areas, gain habitat.I find little support for the notion that rich avifaunas in themselves repel the establishment of avian invaders at the level of whole islands or archipelagoes. However, interactions between established exotics and natives may be influencing habitat distributions of species in both sets within islands. In both man-made habitats and native forest habitats, exotic species number and the relative abundance of exotic birds is negatively related to the number of native species. After accounting for this local variation, exotic species number is positively related to exotic species number for the entire island/region. In local surveys the relative abundance of exotic birds compared to native birds is affected by habitat (non-native habitats have more exotics) and also by the numbers of species of exotics and natives on the island. The relative importance of biotic interactions like competition, apparent competition through differential disease transmission or susceptibility, and predation in shaping the abundance and habitat affinities of exotics and native species can be difficult to unravel when regional affects are so important."

Abstract: 'AbstractUntil now, phylogenetic studies of the mongooses (Carnivora, Herpestidae) have not included an exhaustive sampling of the Asian members of this family. In this study, we used mitochondrial (Cytochrome b and ND2), nuclear (\xce\xb2-fibrinogen intron 7 and Transthyretin intron 1) sequences from almost all of the recognized mongoose species to produce a well-resolved phylogeny of the Herpestidae. We also performed molecular dating analyses to infer divergence dates of the different lineages within the Herpestidae. Our results confirmed the paraphyly of the Herpestes genus and other phylogenetic relationships, which previously had only been moderately supported. The Asian herpestid species were found to form a monophyletic group within the Herpestidae. Within the Asian species, a cyto-nuclear conflict was discovered between the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus), the Indian gray mongoose (Herpestes edwardsii) and the Javan mongoose (Herpestes javanicus), which may have occurred through interspecific hybridization. This study inferred an Early Miocene origin for the Herpestidae and a Middle Miocene origin for the Asian mongooses.'

Abstract: "Sustainable development is an equitable, empowering, environmentally sound, economically viable process of growth. Energy is the key indicator of sustainable development. About 74% of the population of India live in rural areas. 80% of their energy needs are derived from biomass. About 92% of this energy is consumed in cooking activity. Women play a major role in biofuel management. Rural women's perspective in sustainable development is therefore critical.Declining biofuel resources, poor quality of the available biofuels and inefficient devices have pushed women into greater hardships. This paper examines the role of rural women in biomass management. The energy resources that rural women use, the strategy that the government and other organisations have adopted to alleviate rural energy problems and how these strategies have benefited women and improved their quality of life, the importance of incorporating the concept of \xe2\x80\x9cgender and development\xe2\x80\x9d in alternative energy strategies to achieve the objectives of sustainable development are discussed in this paper."

Abstract: 'AbstractWe examine the financial aspects of three silvicultural systems to encourage the sustainability of valuable hardwood species in mixed-dipterocarp forests of southwest Sri Lanka. We compare the net present value (NPV) of the current forest management approach (diameter limit harvests) with shelterwood harvests that promote light hardwood timber species. In this analysis, we also consider the potential of enrichment planting various precious timber (Diospyros quaesita \xe2\x80\x94 calamander), and non-timber forest product (NTFP) species (Caryota urens \xe2\x80\x94 fishtail palm; Elettaria cardamomum var. major \xe2\x80\x94 cardamom; Calamus zeylanicus \xe2\x80\x94 rattan) in conjunction with timber harvests. Two real (inflation adjusted) discount rates were used, 4 and 6%, respectively. Results show that when real discount rates are low (4%), and advance regeneration is present, NPV is highest for the one-cut shelterwood (US $9983\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921). At a high discount rate (6%), reflecting the current short-term concession system and unstable rights to harvest, and where no advance regeneration was present, the diameter limit system (US $7173\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) was the optimum. On sites with advanced regeneration, the one-cut shelterwood system is clearly preferable. For all but rattan, shelterwood treatments provide higher NPVs for NTFPs than diameter limit cuttings primarily because of the higher light regimes and more growing space made available early in the rotation. The value for tea cultivation (US $26,000\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) far exceeds the value of managing these lands for timber alone, explaining the dramatic expansion in tea plantations on private lands. However, our results suggest that managing these lands for a combination of timber and enrichment plantings of NTFPs (US $23,000\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) can be comparable to tea plantations. By managing for NTFPs and timber, forest managers have new opportunities to solve the old problems of high-grading and land-use conversion.'

Abstract: 'AbstractSince the early 1980s several new approaches towards forest management, which include active participation of local communities, have been tried out in many tropical regions. As a result of these efforts recognition has increased about the various ways in which many local communities are already actively managing their forest resources. The planning of development interventions to stimulate more efficient community involvement in forest management can often be based on such indigenous forest management systems. This paper aims to improve the understanding about the diversity and dynamics of indigenous forest management. The analysis consists of three parts. First an overview of the various types of indigenous forest management and their dynamics is presented. Subsequently, the basic principles of forest management are discussed. Forest management is characterized as involving a set of both technical activities and social arrangements for the protection and utilization of forest resources and the distribution of forest products. Three major categories of forest management practices are identified, e.g. controlled utilization of forest products, protection and maintenance of forest stands, and purposeful regeneration. The practices in the first category are both socially and biologically oriented, whereas the activities of the last two categories are biologically oriented. These principles are then used to develop a classification model of the various evolutionary phases in forest management. Along the lines of a similar model developed for exploitation of agricultural crops, various stages of forest management are distinguished along a gradient of increasing input of human energy per unit of exploited forest. This gradient represents a continuum of forest-people interactions; it illustrates how the various manifestations of indigenous forest management may be arranged along a nature-culture continuum.'

Abstract: 'AbstractManagement of natural forests might be one option to reduce the high deforestation rate in Ecuador. We therefore evaluated the response of water and nutrient cycles in a natural tropical montane forest to improvement fellings with the aim of favoring economically valuable target trees which will later be harvested with additional ecosystem impacts not considered here.The study was conducted at ca. 1900\xe2\x80\x932200\xc2\xa0m above sea level in the south Ecuadorian Andes on the east-exposed slope of the east cordillera. In June 2004, one of two paired ca. 10-ha large catchments was thinned by felling 10.2% of the initial basal area (dbh\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa5\xc2\xa010\xc2\xa0cm) on 30% of the catchment. The stems remained in situ. We measured ecosystem fluxes from rainfall via throughfall and stemflow to soil solution (litter leachate, soil solution at 15 and 30\xc2\xa0cm depth) and stream flow between May 2004 and May 2005. After the fellings, soil solutions were extracted from the gaps created by the felled trees and the forest next to the gaps. We determined aboveground water fluxes by direct measurement and soil water fluxes with a budget approach. In the solutions, we measured concentrations of NH4+-N, NO3\xe2\x88\x92-N, total dissolved N, PO43\xe2\x88\x92-P, total dissolved P, Ca, Mg, K, Na, and Cl\xe2\x88\x92. Fluxes were calculated as volume-weighted mean (vwm) concentrations times water fluxes. Dry deposition was estimated using Cl\xe2\x88\x92 as inert tracer.The fellings increased concentrations of N, K, Ca, and Mg in the organic layer of the resulting gaps compared with the forest next to the gaps (vwm concentrations of N: 6.4\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 in the forest next to the gap/8.7\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 in the gaps, K: 9.8/11, Mg: 1.8/3.0, Ca: 3.4/5.8). Lower nutrient concentrations and fluxes in the mineral soil of the gaps than in forest next to the gaps suggested that these nutrients were taken up by ground vegetation and target trees. The paired modified and undisturbed catchments had similar water and nutrient budgets. The fellings did not have a significant impact on the water and nutrient budget at the catchment scale.'

Abstract: 'AbstractBangladesh has very limited nonrenewable energy resources of its own. She is facing energy crisis and serious desertification problem in rural areas. These issues could be removed if renewable energy is used as a primary source of energy in rural areas. It is essential for scientists and researchers to find out the renewable energy resources and effective technologies. Bangladesh is endowed with vast renewable energy resources such as biomass and solar insolation. Besides, hydro and wind power can be considered as potential renewable energy resources. Harnessing these resources appears to be a promising solution for improving the quality of life of rural villagers. The government and many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have tried to comprehend and have strived to address the problem of energy. This paper reviews the renewable energy resources and renewable energy technologies (RETs) practicing in Bangladesh in terms of its implementation, research and development activities. The development and trial of systems are mostly funded so far by donor agencies in collaboration with government and NGOs.Biomass energy sources are traditionally used for domestic cooking and in small rural industries. Approximately 60% of total energy demand of the country is supplied by indigenous biomass based fuels. Activities on the development and promotion of biomass technologies have been going on for one decade. Some national and international funds have been available for biogas technology, improved biomass cookers and production of biomass briquettes. At the time, around 25,000 biogas plants exist all over the country in rural areas and educational institutes, etc. More than 0.20 million improve stoves have been installed to save biomass fuel. Over 900 briquetting machines have been operating in the country on commercial basis.The annual solar radiation availability in Bangladesh is as high as 1700\xc2\xa0kWh/m2. Research and demonstration activities carried out for one decade have led to a start of large-scale utilization of PV (solar photovoltaic) by various organizations and by NGOs. More than 61,500 solar PV systems of a total capacity around 3\xc2\xa0MW and 260 hot box cookers have been installed all over the country mainly in off-grid rural, hill tracks and coastal Bangladesh.Kaptai hydroelectric power plant is the only one renewable energy power generation plant of the country that is generating 3.28% of total 3651.20\xc2\xa0MW. The first micro hydropower unit of 10\xc2\xa0kW has been installed in a village of Bandarban through private initiatives. The project is providing electricity to 140 families in the village and to a Buddhist Temple.The annual wind speed at a height of 25\xc2\xa0m at some coastal locations is above 4\xc2\xa0m/s and much higher in the pre-monsoon and monsoon periods. The sites are suitable for power generation, particularly using PV or diesel hybrid technique for winter months.'

Title: 'Research paperArchetypes of catenas in respect to matter \xe2\x80\x94 a concept for structuring and grouping catenas'
Author: 'M.'

Abstract: 'AbstractStructuring soils on a landscape level of scale is a necessary prerequisite for an extrapolation of point results to greater areas (upscaling), not only in soil genetic research but also for ecological purposes. In this respect the catena concept provides a very useful paradigm to decipher soil pattern and related regular trends in soil chemical properties on the landscape scale. Using this approach we created types of matter distribution out of frequently recurring patterns. Three archetypes of catenas can be distinguished for soil components depending on the (im-)mobilization processes and hydrological regimes: (i) transformation catenas showing no gains or losses of the element/soil component under study (only transformation processes working), (ii) leaching catenas with losses in at least part of the catena and no accompanying elemental gains in other parts, and (iii) accumulation catenas showing gains in at least part of the catena but no losses elsewhere in the catena. From a spatial regular pattern of element losses combined with gains in one catena a translocation catena can be inferred. Such catenas can be regarded as a subgroup of the leaching- or accumulation-type, but exclude the transformation-type. Catenas which cover geomorphic units of distinctly different ages belong to the chrono catenas, a subgroup of either the transformation-, leaching-, or accumulation-type. The spatial arrangement and extension of depletion/accumulation areas and flow directions of translocated elements/soil components (down-/upslope) lead to a further subdivision of the catena types.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe objectives of this study were to describe the floristic composition, species diversity, similarity and richness among three stages of forest regeneration, and to investigate the influence of the previous land use on species composition in a seasonally dry tropical forest in northwestern Costa Rica. The species diversity and richness of woody stems with diameter greater or equal to 5\xc2\xa0cm in 26 0.1\xc2\xa0ha plots was found to be the greatest in the intermediate stage followed by the late and early stages. The structural changes of this chronosequence of successional stages were quantified with a modification of the Holdridge complexity index. Using satellite imagery for site selection and historical ground truth analysis the influence of past land use and the frequency of anthropogenic disturbances on species composition was illustrated.'

Title: 'ExpresSedGeomorphology and palaeoclimatology of some Upper Cretaceous palaeosols in central India'
Author: 'Parthasarathi'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) Lameta Formation exposed around Jabalpur in central India comprises a pedogenically modified fluvial succession. Accumulation of early diagenetic calcite cement during penecontemporaneous pedogenesis has transformed the fluvial sandstones into calcareous sandstones. The microscopic features of the palaeosol material include floating grain fabric, root traces, laminated micrite-microspar, micrite envelopes and corona structures, illuvial clay envelopes, poikilotopic spars and minor amounts of siliceous grain and void cutans.The palaeosol profiles of the Lameta Formation can be classified into eleven different types, nine of which are comparable to present-day mature aridisols and two to inceptisols. Nine to thirteen palaeosol profiles are present in the individual sections of the Lameta Formation within the study area. Each profile comprises two to four distinct pedohorizons arranged in vertical succession. There are six types of pedohorizons present in the area of study, namely, partly altered hosts, light-coloured and poorly cemented horizons, horizons with root traces and root-related alterations, horizons of subspherical glaebules, horizons of platy-fused glaebules and subhorizontal root traces and horizons with solution features. They show many characteristics similar to the present-day soil horizons, for example those termed C, Bk, K, A and E by pedologists.The palaeosol characteristics show correspondence to the nature of fluvial channel migration and the depth of the groundwater table (controlled by the geomorphic setting). A shallow groundwater table favoured the development of rootmat-bearing and gleyed horizons. Horizons with vertical root traces and glaebules occur where the groundwater table was low. Mature and thin palaeosols developed in those parts of the Lameta fluvial tract that were characterized by stable channels and wide floodplains. In contrast, thin and comparatively immature soils occurred in the parts where laterally migrating channels were operative.The characteristics of the Lameta palaeosols suggest that a hot and semiarid climate prevailed for most of the time represented by the Lameta Formation, but short-term wet spells occurred during the initial and the terminal phases of the Lameta accumulation. The low latitudinal palaeoposition of India and the absence of the palaeo-monsoon circulation might have produced the hot and semiarid climatic setting during this time.'

Title: 'Research review paperFrozen beauty: The cryobiotechnology of orchid diversity'
Author: 'Elena'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975016300015
Abstract: 'AbstractOrchids (Orchidaceae) are one of the most diverse plant groups on the planet with over 25,000 species. For over a century, scientists and horticulturalists have been fascinated by their complex floral morphology, pollinator specificity and multiple ethnobotanical uses, including as food, flavourings, medicines, ornaments, and perfumes. These important traits have stimulated world-wide collection of orchid species, often for the commercial production of hybrids and leading to frequent overexploitation. Increasing human activities and global environmental changes are also accelerating the threat of orchid extinction in their natural habitats. In order to improve gene conservation strategies for these unique species, innovative developments of cryopreservation methodologies are urgently needed based on an appreciation of low temperature (cryo) stress tolerance, the stimulation of recovery growth of plant tissues in vitro and on the \xe2\x80\x98omics\xe2\x80\x99 characterization of the targeted cell system (biotechnology). The successful development and application of such cryobiotechnology now extends to nearly 100 species and commercial hybrids of orchids, underpinning future breeding and species conservation programmes. In this contribution, we provide an overview of the progress in cryobanking of a range of orchid tissues, including seeds, pollen, protocorms, protocorm-like bodies, apices excised from in vitro plants, cell suspensions, rhizomes and orchid fungal symbionts. We also highlight future research needs.'

Title: 'Ailanthus triphysa at different densities and fertiliser regimes in Kerala, India: growth, yield, nutrient use efficiency and nutrient export through harvest'
Author: 'Naveed'

Abstract: 'AbstractA split plot trial involving Ailanthus triphysa (ailanthus) at four spacings (3m\xc3\x971\xc2\xa0m, 2m\xc3\x972\xc2\xa0m, 3m\xc3\x972\xc2\xa0m and 3m\xc3\x973\xc2\xa0m) and four fertiliser regimes (0:0:0, 50:25:25, 100:50:50 and 150:75:75\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 per year N, P2O5, K2O) was initiated in June 1991. Objectives included evaluating the growth and yield potential of ailanthus grown under differing density and fertiliser regimes and to estimate the nutrient export through harvest. Ninety-six randomly selected average-sized trees were felled at 8.8 years of age for assessment. Results show that height, diameter, stand leaf area index, biomass production and volume yield were greater in the 2m\xc3\x972\xc2\xa0m spacing. Repeated application of fertilisers at 1.2, 2.25 and 5.25 years after planting had little effect on biomass and volume yields, presumably because of weed competition (despite periodic weed control), higher pest incidence (in the heavily fertilised plots) and/or moderately adequate soil nutrient levels. Regarding partitioning of tree biomass, stem wood represented the principal component (>70%), while foliage contributed the least (<7%). Conversely, foliar N, P and K concentrations were the highest, followed by branch wood, coarse roots and stem wood. Denser stands showed greater accumulation of N, P and K with higher potential for nutrient export through harvest. However, as the bole fraction accounted for only about 56\xe2\x80\x9364% of the total nutrients removed, leaving other biomass components (foliage and branches) at the site will reduce the associated nutrient export. Wider spacings (3m\xc3\x972\xc2\xa0m and 3m\xc3\x973\xc2\xa0m) were more efficient in N and K use, but P use efficiency was higher in 2m\xc3\x972\xc2\xa0m. Likewise, trees in the no fertiliser plots exhibited greatest N, P and K use efficiencies. Available soil P, K and organic C levels declined with increasing tree density, while repeated fertilisation increased nutrient concentrations. Soil pH and available P levels declined in comparison to the pre-treatment values.'

Title: 'Adaptation and the color statistics of natural images'
Author: 'Michael A.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698997001259
Abstract: 'AbstractColor perception depends profoundly on adaptation processes that adjust sensitivity in response to the prevailing pattern of stimulation. We examined how color sensitivity and appearance might be influenced by adaptation to the color distributions characteristic of natural images. Color distributions were measured for natural scenes by sampling an array of locations within each scene with a spectroradiometer, or by recording each scene with a digital camera successively through 31 interference filters. The images were used to reconstruct the L, M and S cone excitation at each spatial location, and the contrasts along three post-receptoral axes [L + M, L \xe2\x88\x92 M or S \xe2\x88\x92 (L + M)]. Individual scenes varied substantially in their mean chromaticity and luminance, in the principal color-luminance axes of their distributions, and in the range of contrasts in their distributions. Chromatic contrasts were biased along a relatively narrow range of bluish to yellowish-green angles, lying roughly between the S - (L + M) axis (which was more characteristic of scenes with lush vegetation and little sky) and a unique blue-yellow axis (which was more typical of arid scenes). For many scenes L - M and S - (L + M) signals were highly correlated, with weaker correlations between luminance and chromaticity. We use a two-stage model (von Kries scaling followed by decorrelation) to show how the appearance of colors may be altered by light adaptation to the mean if the distributions and by contrast adaptation to the contrast range and principal axes of the distributions; and we show that such adjustments are qualitatively consistent with empirical measurements of asymmetric color matches obtained after adaptation to successive random samples drawn from natural distributions of chromaticities and lightnesses. Such adaptation effects define the natural range of operating states of the visual system.'

Title: 'Pathways of calcrete development on weathered silicate rocks in Tamil Nadu, India: Mineralogy, chemistry and paleoenvironmental implications'
Author: 'N.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0037073806000820
Abstract: 'AbstractPoorly documented yet spectacularly thick and extensive outcrops of calcrete hardpan occur on gneiss in the semiarid region of Coimbatore, South India. The hardpan caps a series of residual plateaux forming the present-day continental divide and grades into large expanses of Vertisols. Characteristic calcrete and Vertisol profiles were logged along toposequences and sampled for macro- and micromorphological study, and for chemical and mineralogical composition. Strontium isotopic analyses revealed that the calcrete is derived from in situ weathering of Ca-bearing primary minerals of the saprolite, which is rich in ankerite, Ca-amphiboles and Ca-plagioclase. The macroscale analysis revealed a range of facies developed within the gneiss saprolite, but in terms of relative chronology the nodular hardpan has the longest history. Two evolutionary pathways leading to nodular hardpan formation have been established. The first occurs entirely within a vadose environment, whereas the second begins within a phreatic environment before continuing to develop in vadose conditions. The ability to identify and map these generic categories of calcrete constitutes a potential tool for reconstructing paleotopography and paleogroundwater levels. The bedrock-weathering-derived nodular hardpan is blanketed by a laminar facies that correlates with an eolian event with marine Sr signatures. This suggests influx of Ca dust from the Arabian Sea continental shelf during a Pleistocene sea-level low-stand. It defines an important benchmark in the chronology of the area and highlights the potential antiquity of the thick calcrete profiles.'

Title: 'Biohardening with Plant Growth Promoting Rhizosphere and Endophytic bacteria induces systemic resistance against Banana bunchy top virus'
Author: 'S.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139307001849
Abstract: 'AbstractTissue culture banana has emerged as one of the leading global agro based industrial technologies. However, the banana plants are found to be more susceptible to pests and diseases due to their pliable nature and lack of withstanding in the natural environment. Banana bunchy top disease (BBTD) caused by Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) is the most serious virus disease of banana and plantain world wide. Biopriming (or) biohardening refers to treatment of tissue culture banana plantlets with microbial inoculants to strengthen the plantlets against biotic and abiotic stresses. Forty plant growth promoting endophytic bacteria (PGPE) were isolated from the corm and roots of banana and tested for the ability to induce systemic resistance against BBTV. Phenotypic and molecular characterization of the endophytic bacteria revealed the presence of Pseudomonas and Bacillus species. Micropropagated banana plantlets were tested for the presence of BBTV by ELISA, DIBA and PCR and the uninfected plants were biohardened with two rhizobacterial (Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pf1, CHA0) and endophytic bacterial (EPB5, EPB22) strains. Plants treated with mixtures of rhizobacterial and endophytic bacterial formulations viz., EPB5\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0EPB22\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0Pf1\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0CHA0 was significantly effective in reducing BBTV under field conditions recording 33.33% infection with 60% reduction over control. The expression of defense-related enzymes and pathogenesis related proteins were more in the plants treated with rhizosphere and endophytic bacterial formulations than the control plants. The morphological and physiological characters were also well pronounced in the treated plants indicating its plant growth promoting nature. Thus, the present study clearly demonstrated that PGPR and PGPE mediated induction of systemic resistance in banana plants against BBTV have the potential role in the management of BBTD.'

Author: 'Sylvie'

Abstract: 'AbstractSince 1984, the diameter increment of nearly 50\xc2\xa0000 trees \xe2\xa9\xbe10\xc2\xa0cm DBH has been monitored every year in 12 long-term experimental 6.25\xc2\xa0ha plots of the Paracou experimental station, French Guiana. In order to study and compare forest dynamics in disturbed and undisturbed stands, contrasted silvicultural treatments were performed between 1986 and 1988 in these plots. Taking advantage of this experimental design and of this large database, a forest dynamics modelling project was started in 1992. This paper aims at presenting the growth component of the single-tree, distance-dependent model that was developed within the framework of this project. This individual diameter growth model was built according to the \xe2\x80\x98potential\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0modifier\xe2\x80\x99 paradigm: it links tree annual diameter increment to variables describing tree size and instantaneous competition as well as the recent past evolution of the competition. Species information was also taken into account and resulted: (i) in the classification of tree species into 15 functional groups that are homogeneous for diameter growth; and (ii) in a definite improvement of model efficiency. Attempts to further reduce the residual variance through the use of soil and topographical information remained unsuccessful.'

Title: 'Comparative morphology of the vegetative structures of Tristicha trifaria, Indotristicha ramosissima and Dalzellia ceylanica (Podostemaceae, Tristichoideae): a review'
Author: 'Irmgard'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304377096011199
Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper summarizes and elaborates upon previously published investigations of the comparative morphology of vegetative features of Tristicha trifaria (Bory ex Willd.) Spreng., Indotristicha ramosissima (Wight) van Royen and Dalzellia ceylanica (Gard.) Wight (Podostemaceae, Tristichoideae) (J\xc3\xa4ger-Z\xc3\xbcrn, 1970, 1992, 1995). The architecture of these taxa can be traced to common developmental patterns in angiosperms. Alterations of typical structures within the \xe2\x80\x9cprinciples of variable proportions\xe2\x80\x9d contribute to their eccentric appearance.The sympodial branching pattern plays a key role for understanding the growth form of these species. A second important feature is the tendency to form coenosomes (fused shoot axes). In Tristicha trifaria and Dalzellia ceylanica the vegetative system is complicated by fusion of the proximal parts of branches from inception with the mother shoots or each other, respectively. The lichen-like crusts of Dalzellia ceylanica are based on coenosomatic fusion. Tristicha trifaria develops rather intricate forms by coenosomatic fusion of shoots. These processes, causing a displacement of the subtending leaves of the respective branches as well as a lateral asymmetry of the stem, are discussed in detail. Tristicha trifaria develops upright shoots with elongated internodes and also shoots that are crust-like and flattened with short internodes.A dorsiventral symmetry of shoots becomes more progressively developed working from Indotristicha ramosissima to Tristicha trifaria and finally Dalzellia ceylanica, where it effects a branching only from the flanks of the unilateral axis, causing a 2-dimensional flattening of the whole system with a specific phyllotaxy and anisophylly. The discussions herein confirm the view of a general conformity of the morphological features of Indotristicha ramosissima, Tristicha trifaria and Dalzellia ceylanica with common features of angiosperms, and support the applicability of the classical root-shoot model to these plants.'

Title: 'Physical control of soil organic matter dynamics in the tropics'
Author: 'C.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706197000396
Abstract: 'AbstractManagement of soil organic matter (SOM) is esential to sustaining the quality and productivity of soils around the globe. This appears to be particularly true in the tropics where there is a greater proportion of nutrient poor, highly weathered soils that are more susceptible to losses of SOM. Developing management practices that promote the maintenance and storage of SOM in the tropics depends on understanding the factors that control SOM dynamics. This paper describes the role that soil physical properties (mineralogy, texture, and structure) play in regulating the accumulation and loss of SOM in tropical soils. Two different approaches are presented here. The first approach explores relationships between total SOM and soil physical properties in the tropics. These include effects of climate and mineralogy on latitudinal gradients in SOM, interactions between texture and mineralogy as determinants of SOM storage and relationships between SOM and the structural stability of soils. The second approach describes characteristics of SOM associated with different physical constituents of the soil, with particular attention to particle-size fractions and aggregated particles of different sizes. In each case we summarise findings on the distribution of SOM among fractions and characterise its biochemical composition, bioavailability and turnover. Evidence for and against the physical protection of organic matter from microbial attack in tropical soils is also given. Wherever possible, we compare and contrast the findings for tropical soils with those of temperate soils.
