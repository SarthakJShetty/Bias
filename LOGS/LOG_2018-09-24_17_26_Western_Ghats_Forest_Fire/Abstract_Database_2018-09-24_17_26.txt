Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Six fire frequency classes were obtained in the study area, between 1999 and 2013.\xe2\x80\xa2Fire return interval is increased to 9.28\xc2\xa0years from 3.3\xc2\xa0year (1989\xe2\x80\x932002).\xe2\x80\xa2Tree diversity decreased with increasing fire frequencies.\xe2\x80\xa2Low fire frequencies promote seedling density.\xe2\x80\xa2Stem size between 1 and 20\xc2\xa0cm dbh showed much variation across the fire classes.AbstractThis study was aimed to understand the effect of repeated fire on tropical dry deciduous forest in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR), Western Ghats. Tropical dry deciduous forests are prone to forest fire owing to high fuel load and long dry season. Fire frequency map of the study area was prepared for 15\xc2\xa0years from 1999 to 2013 using annual burn maps. Study area was stratified as B1 to B6 (one to six times burned) and compared to control (B0 \xe2\x80\x93 unburned during 1999\xe2\x80\x932013). Three plots were randomly laid in each stratum and seedlings; saplings and trees present in each plot were recorded. Species diversity indices showed increase in dominance and decrease in diversity with increasing fire frequency. Results showed that overall stem density (>1\xc2\xa0cm DBH) ranged from 576 (SD 112.69) (B1) to 236 (SD 20) individual ha\xe2\x88\x921 (B6). The basal area ranged from 36.8 (SD 2.19) m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 (B0) to 12.12 (SD 2.69) m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 (B5). Fire promoted seedling density from B0 to B2 and after that it started decreasing whereas sapling density was poor in all classes and recorded least in B6. Stem density of trees did not vary much up to B3 and started decreasing after that. Number of species decreased linearly with increasing fire frequency. In the analysis of dominant species, Tectona grandis showed a very significant mean difference in seedling, sapling and tree population whereas Terminalia cranulata did not show significant difference in mean densities of seedling, sapling or trees. It is found that fire with long interval can promote seedlings density but species diversity decreases with increasing fire frequency.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper presents a study of phytoliths (opal silica bodies from plants) from sediment sequences obtained from two tropical forest patches in the Western Ghats of India: a sacred grove (sequence covers last 550\xc2\xa0cal BP) and a forest patch in a plantation (sequence covers last 7500\xc2\xa0cal BP). The sites are located at mid-elevation (c. 650\xe2\x80\x931400\xc2\xa0m above sea level) in a mosaic landscape showing anthropogenic open habitats and plantations as well as some evergreen forests. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the landscape composition of grassland and forest over time in the region, grassland being invariably shaped by anthropogenic activities, particularly fire for cultivation. We identified and classified phytoliths into 34 morphotypes from five taxonomic groups: Poaceae (grasses), Cyperaceae (sedges), Arecaceae (palms), Pteridopsida (ferns) and woody dicotyledons (broad-leaved trees and shrubs). We also calculated the humidity\xe2\x80\x93aridity index (Iph). First, our results show that grasses are the most represented phytolith types in both sites, followed by broad-leaved trees and shrubs, palms, sedges, and ferns. Second, the highly variable climatic index Iph over the last 1000 years suggest that changes in phytolith percentage (e.g. broad-leaved trees) might be caused by human agro-pastoral activities, such as clearing through fires and irrigation. Prior to these human activities, the phytolith signal for early Holocene climate is congruent with the existing literature. Finally, this study compares new phytolith results with previous pollen data from the same sites. We find good agreement between these two botanical proxies throughout, thus validating our findings. We provide important evidence regarding the history of environmental change due to anthropogenic activities in the Western Ghats. This has important implications because it provides insights into how tropical forest will respond to increased intensity of human activities.'

Abstract: 'AbstractYet there is considerable uncertainty over management effectiveness of many protected areas around the world. In this regard, long-term monitoring and management of disturbances in the protected areas need to be properly addressed and documented. The present study is aimed to analyze spatial extent, frequency and distribution of forest fires in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, Western Ghats, India over four decades (1973\xe2\x80\x932014). Multi-temporal Landsat and Indian Remote Sensing satellite data were used to quantify forest burnt area. The results showed that the spatial extent of burnt area greatly varied between 1318\xe2\x80\xafkm2 (in 1989) to 15.7\xe2\x80\xafkm2 (in 2013). The monitoring of fires during the recent decade (2005\xe2\x80\x932014) was observed to have a gradual decline over the reserve. High frequency of fires has been found in dry deciduous forest followed by moist deciduous forest, scrub, grassland and semi-evergreen forest. Among six protected areas, Bandipur National Park had represented more fire incidents followed by Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Nagarhole and Mukurthi National Parks. Grid analysis shows that 67% of the grids were affected by forest fires. Large burnt patches have steadily decreased in their size while the other patch classes showed a significant reduction in their size over the study period. This study had revealed the role of climate and accessibility in relation to fire occurrences. Based on historical burnt area mapping outputs, fire hotspots have been modeled to address fire risk zones. Indeed, the Mann-Kendall trend test has indicated that the overall trend of fire incidents have been declining and this indicates the management effectiveness in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Assessed land use and temperature dynamics during 1973\xe2\x80\x932016 in protected areas.\xe2\x80\xa2The evergreen forest cover has declined from 33 to 27% in Kudremukh National Park.\xe2\x80\xa2Similar trend of 14% deciduous forest decline in Bandipur Tiger Reserve.\xe2\x80\xa2Simulation for 2026 shows further increase in plantations and decimation of forests.AbstractForest ecosystems sustain biota on the earth as they are habitat to diverse biotic species, arrests soil erosion, play a crucial role in water cycle, sequester carbon, and helps in mitigating the impacts of global warming. Large scale land use land cover (LULC) change leading to deforestation is one of the drivers of global climate changes and alteration of biogeochemical cycles with significant consequences in ecosystem services and biodiversity. This has necessitated the investigation of LULC by mapping, monitoring and modelling spatio-temporal patterns and evaluating these in the context of human-environment interactions. The current work investigates LULC changes with temperature dynamics of select protected areas in Western Ghats. The land use analyses reveal changes in the forest cover across Kudremukh National Park (KNP), Rajiv Gandhi Tiger Reserve (RTR), Bandipur Tiger Reserve (BTR). KNP region has lost evergreen forest cover during 1973\xe2\x80\x932016 from 33.46 to 27.22%, while BTR lost deciduous cover from 61.69 to 47.3% due to mining, horticulture plantations, human habitations, etc. The LST increase has impacted regeneration of species with the induced water stress, etc. CA-Markov modelling was used for forecasting the likely land uses in 2026 and validation was done through Kappa indices. Results highlight decline of evergreen cover in KNP (9%) and deciduous cover in RTR (2%) followed by BTR (3%) with further expansion of plantations, which will impact biodiversity, hydrology and ecology. Insights of LULC dynamics help natural resource managers in evolving appropriate strategies to ensure conservation of threatened biota in Western Ghats.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (494KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Pestalotiopsis species occur as generalist endophytes in trees of Western Ghats forests of southern India'
Author: 'M. Sudhakara'

Abstract: 'AbstractOne hundred tree species from 4 different forest types (25 from each forest) of the Western Ghats were studied for the occurrence of Pestalotiopsis as foliar endophytes. Morphological and ITS sequence study confirmed that species of Pestalotiopsis are generalist endophytes infecting taxonomically unrelated tree hosts. Furthermore, a single tree species harboured more than one species of this endophyte. Considering the leaf as a microhabitat, such a wide ecological amplitude of Pestalotiopsis as a foliar endophyte appears to be the result of accumulation of a suite of traits which are governed by the environment. This could be one of the reasons for the existence of generalist fungi among endophytes transcending host taxonomic and habitat restrictions.'

Title: 'Niche models inform the effects of climate change on the endangered Nilgiri Tahr (Nilgiritragus hylocrius) populations in the southern Western Ghats, India'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Niche models were used to quantify the impact of climate change on Nilgiri Tahr.\xe2\x80\xa2Suitable habitat for Tahr is expected to decrease drastically in future.\xe2\x80\xa2Small populations may face extinction debts due to the effect of climate change.\xe2\x80\xa2Monitoring, maintaining, and improving current habitat quality is recommended.AbstractLarge mammals are declining globally due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Climate change is one of the factors known to alter the range of several mammalian species. An early understanding of the effect of climate change on species distributions can provide critical information for conservation planning. Nilgiritragus hylocrius (Nilgiri Tahr) is an endangered ungulate that is restricted to the montane grasslands of the Western Ghats, India. Currently, the Nilgiri Tahr is restricted to a fraction of its former range and is also prone to risks due to several ongoing anthropogenic pressures. However, the impact of global climate change on this emblematic species has seldom been estimated. The goal of our study was to use ecological niche models to quantify the effect of climate change on the habitats of Nilgiri Tahr. Using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm, we modelled the potential distribution of Nilgiri Tahr in its native range. The models were developed under the current climatic conditions and then projected onto two future climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and for three different time frames in the future (years 2030, 2050 and 2080). We identified that most of the climatically suitable habitats of Nilgiri Tahr would become unsuitable when global warming intensifies. Our models predicted a complete loss of suitable habitats in many existing protected areas in the Western Ghats. We use insights provided by our modeling results to propose conservation management plans to increase the likelihood of persistence of Nilgiri Tahr in the Western Ghats.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (110KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Cultural drivers of reforestation in tropical forest groves of the Western Ghats of India'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Sacred forest groves are protected historically through cultural practices.\xe2\x80\xa2We show that some sacred groves are regenerated patches of forest.\xe2\x80\xa2The social\xe2\x80\x93ecological system of sacred forest groves changes over time.\xe2\x80\xa2Various cultural, social, political and ecological drivers are identified.\xe2\x80\xa2We provide insights for modern-day forest restoration and management.AbstractSacred forest groves in the Western Ghats of India are small fragments of tropical forest that have received protection due to religious beliefs and cultural practices. These forest fragments are an example of community-based conservation and they serve as refugia for many forest-dwelling species in otherwise highly anthropogenic tropical forest-agriculture landscapes of the Indian Western Ghats. Many of these sacred forest groves are considered ancient woodlands, but there is very little information on their origins. For instance: How old are these sacred groves? Are they relics of forest that was once continuous or are they patches of regenerated vegetation? How do changes in the surrounding landscape influence the vegetation in these groves? Based on palaeoecological reconstruction in two such sacred forest groves, we determined the age of these forest fragments. Both reconstructions indicate transition from non-forest open landscape to tree-covered landscape at these sites. These finding from two sacred groves challenge the common perception that sacred forest groves are remnants of once-continuous forest; instead, some sacred groves such as those studied might be regenerated forest patches that are approximately 400\xc2\xa0years old. This further raises a number of questions about the drivers of reforestation in these groves. What were the social and cultural circumstances which led to the recovery of forest within these patches? How did land tenure influence forest recovery? What role did religious beliefs play in forest restoration? Using Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s (1956) framework of \xe2\x80\x98cultural revitalization\xe2\x80\x99 and based on historical literature and palaeoecological analysis of the two sacred groves, this paper examines the drivers of reforestation in the Western Ghats of India. It suggests various social, ecological and economic drivers of such revitalization, recognizing strong linkages between the \xe2\x80\x98social\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98ecological\xe2\x80\x99 within the social\xe2\x80\x93ecological system of sacred forest groves. This example of reforestation suggests that contemporary restoration of forests needs to operate at a landscape scale and look at restoration as a social\xe2\x80\x93ecological intervention in forest management.'

Abstract: 'AbstractMaintaining forest cover is important for Biodiversity Hotspots that support many endangered and endemic species but have lost much of their original forest extent. In developing countries, ongoing economic and demographic growth within Hotspots can alter rates and patterns of deforestation, making it a concern to quantify rates of forest loss and assess landscape-scale correlates of deforestation within Hotspots. Such analyses can help set baselines for future monitoring and provide landscape-scale perspectives to design conservation policy. For the Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot in India, we examined correlates of forest loss following rapid economic expansion (post-2000\xe2\x80\xafCE). First, we used open-source remote-sensing data to estimate annual trends in recent forest loss (from 2000 to 2016) for the entire Hotspot. Across the entire Western Ghats, we assessed the relative importance of and interactions among demographic, administrative, and biophysical factors that predicted rates of forest loss\xe2\x80\x94measured as the number of 30\xe2\x80\xaf\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\xaf30-m\xe2\x80\xafpixels of forest lost within randomly selected 1\xe2\x80\xafkm2 cells. Protected areas reduced forest loss by 30%, especially when forests were closer to roads (33%) and towns (36%). However, the advantage of protection declined by 32% when local population densities increased, implying that the difference in forest loss between protected and non-protected areas disappears at high local population densities. To check scale-dependency of spatial extent, we repeated the modelling process for two landscape subsets within Western Ghats. In contrast with results for the entire Western Ghats, both focal landscapes showed no difference in deforestation with protection status alone or its interactions with village population density and distance to towns. However, deforestation was 88% lower when forests were protected and farther from roads. Overall, our results indicate that protected areas help retain forest cover within a global Biodiversity Hotspot even with rapid development, but high human population densities and road development can reduce the benefits of protection.'

Title: 'Research PaperAssessing the impact of land use and land cover changes on the remnant patches of Kondapalli reserve forest of the Eastern Ghats, Andhra Pradesh, India'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe Kondapalli reserve forest (KRF) of the Eastern Ghats, India is subjected to severe anthropogenic interference, despite its status as reserve forest. The present research focuses on assessing the land use and land cover changes in and around KRF using temporal satellite data. It is evident from the current study that there has been a considerable decrease in the forest cover from 1990 to 2015; as seen from 2017 data, huge urban expansions and development activities were observed around KRF. This increase is linked to the growth in population, thereby consuming land available for their basic needs. To assess the rate of urban expansion around the forest, Land consumption rate and Land absorption coefficient were computed. The result of this analysis showed a rapid growth in built-up land between 1990 and 2017 while the periods between 1990 and 2015 witnessed a reduction in the forest class. Further, the study projected adverse impact of the growth of the new capital city-Amaravati on the KRF and proposed requiring suitable conservation measures with respect to its current deforestation and degradation trends.'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Colonial foresters misperceived Indian tropical grasslands as degraded ecosystems.\xe2\x80\xa2This led to natural tropical grassland transformation into exotic tree plantations.\xe2\x80\xa2Exotic trees became invasive in grasslands, causing biodiversity and habitat loss.\xe2\x80\xa2Even today, tropical grasslands are misperceived, mismanaged, & threatened globally.\xe2\x80\xa2Without recognition as legitimate ecosystems, these grasslands face a bleak future.AbstractColonial encounters with tropical ecosystems were primarily driven by profit-oriented management practices; witness the extensive network of timber and forestry practices that were set up across colonial India. In contrast, the colonial engagement with the montane forest-grassland mosaics of the higher reaches of the Western Ghats in southern India was marked by intensive investment in vegetation management by colonial foresters that yielded no profits. In this archival study, we trace the history of extensive vegetation transformation in this landscape from the early nineteenth to the early twentieth century. We show how the misperception that the grasslands within this mosaic must have resulted from tree felling, fire-setting and buffalo grazing by indigenous communities led colonial foresters into a century-long effort at \xe2\x80\x98foresting\xe2\x80\x99 the grasslands, primarily through large-scale planting of exotic tree species. These efforts persisted despite economic losses and ecological evidence that native tree seedlings planted in the grasslands repeatedly failed to establish. These policies continued unabated into the late twentieth century in newly independent India. Today, the once picturesque landscapes of these ancient forest-grassland mosaics are diminished by large-scale plantations of exotic species. Some of these species have become invasive and pose significant threats to the remnant natural grasslands. While this historical narrative is set in the forest-grassland mosaics of southern India, it finds striking parallels in the current day, with grasslands and savannas globally threatened by the misperception that they are \xe2\x80\x98degraded ecosystems\xe2\x80\x99 that can be \xe2\x80\x98forested\xe2\x80\x99 or converted to other \xe2\x80\x98productive\xe2\x80\x99 land uses.

However, the impacts of climate change on the distribution of ecologically vulnerable medicinal species remain largely unknown. The identification of a suitable habitat for a species under climate change scenario is a significant step towards the mitigation of biodiversity decline. The study, therefore, aims to predict the impact of current, and future climatic scenarios on the distribution of the threatened Garcinia indica across the northern Western Ghats using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modelling. The future projections were made for the year 2050 and 2070 with all Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenario (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) using 56 species occurrence data, and 19 bioclimatic predictors from the BCC-CSM1.1 model of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change\xe2\x80\x99s (IPCC) 5th assessment. The bioclimatic variables were minimised to a smaller number of variables after a multicollinearity test, and their contributions were assessed using jackknife test. The AUC value of 0.956\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.023 indicates that the model performs with excellent accuracy. The study identified that temperature seasonality (39.5\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf3.1%), isothermality (19.2\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf1.6%), and annual precipitation (12.7\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf1.7%) would be the major influencing variables in the current and future distribution. The model predicted 10.50% (19318.7\xe2\x80\xafsq.\xe2\x80\xafkm) of the study area as moderately to very highly suitable, while 82.60% (151904\xe2\x80\xafsq.\xe2\x80\xafkm) of the study area was identified as \xe2\x80\x98unsuitable\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98very low suitable\xe2\x80\x99. Our predictions of Climate change impact on habitat suitability suggest that there will be a drastic reduction in the suitability by 5.29% and 5.69% under RCP 8.5 for 2050 and 2070, respectively.Objective and SignificancePrimary objective of this study is to identify the potential distribution of medicinally and ecologically important but threatened Garcinia indica species in the northern Western Ghats on the basis of species occurrence data and nineteen bioclimatic predictors. Using MaxEnt modelling, current and future species distribution and suitability has been predicted using the BCC-CSM1.1 and four RCP scenarios of 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5. The results also signify the bioclimatic variables contribution to the species distribution in northern Western Ghats.Finally, the results signify that the model might be an efficient tool for biodiversity protection, ecosystem management, and species re-habitation planning under future climate change scenarios.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (208KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'A comparative analysis of spatial, temporal, and ecological characteristics of forest fires in seasonally dry tropical ecosystems in the Western Ghats, India'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe Western Ghats in India is one of the 25 global hotspots of biodiversity, and it is the hotspot with the highest human density. This study considers variations in the regional fire regime that are related to vegetation type and past human disturbances in a landscape. Using a combination of remote sensing data and GIS techniques, burnt areas were delineated in three different vegetation types and various metrics of fire size were estimated. Belt transects were enumerated to assess the vegetation characteristics and fire effects in the landscape. Temporal trends suggest increasingly short fire-return intervals in the landscape. In the tropical dry deciduous forest, the mean fire-return interval is 6 years, in the tropical dry thorn forest mean fire-return interval is 10 years, and in the tropical moist deciduous forest mean fire-return interval is 20 years. Tropical dry deciduous forests burned more frequently and had the largest number of fires in any given year as well as the single largest fire (9900\xc2\xa0ha). Seventy percent, 56%, and 30% of the tropical moist deciduous forests, tropical dry thorn forests, and tropical dry deciduous forests, respectively have not burned during the 7-year period of study. The model of fire-return interval as a function of distance from park boundary explained 63% of the spatial variation of fire-return interval in the landscape. Forest fires had significant impacts on species diversity and regeneration in the tropical dry deciduous forests. Species diversity declined by 50% and 60% in the moderate and high frequency classes, respectively compared to the low fire frequency class. Sapling density declined by ca. 30% in both moderate and high frequency classes compared to low frequency class. In tropical moist deciduous ecosystems, there were substantial declines in species diversity, tree density, seedling and sapling densities in burned forests compared to the unburned forests. In contrast forest fires in tropical dry thorn forests had a marginal positive effect on ecosystem diversity, structure, and regeneration.'

With the current estimates of rate of projected environmental change for the 21st century, urgent adaptation and mitigation measures are required to slow down the impact of climate change on biodiversity. A number of studies have shown that recent human-induced environmental changes have already triggered species range shifts, changes in phenology and species extinctions. However, accurate projections of species responses to future climate change are more difficult to ascertain. In recent years, a number of modeling tools are being used to predict the consequences of climate change on the distribution of species and also identify possible ecological niche of a species under different climate change scenarios.In this paper, using the distribution data of the species, we have attempted to (a) identify the current geographical distribution of five species of the family Myristicaceae and predict the possible sites of occurrence of these species in the Western Ghats, India using the niche modeling tools and (b) predict the impact of climate change on the potential distribution of these species for two scenarios (A1B and A2A). All the five species selected for the study are distributed in the Western Ghats with higher densities in the Central Western Ghats. The model predicted an overall increase in the suitable habitats for the non-swampy species. However, there is a shift in the habitat range of these species in response to climate change. Gymnocranthera canarica and Myristica fatua, which are obligate swampy species, tend to be affected in changing climate. For both these species, the overall habitat is reduced due to climate change. These species already have restricted habitat and therefore climate change could pose a serious threat for their future survival. Predicting how species distribution will change in the wake of future global climate change is important to develop effective conservation strategies for these species, which inhabit fragile ecosystems.'

Title: 'Forest resource use and perception of farmers on conservation of a usufruct forest (Soppinabetta) of Western Ghats, India'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe negative impact of anthropogenic activity on tropical forests is well documented, but the underlying factors, including socioeconomic conditions, government policy, and agricultural practices, that influence forest degradation in developing countries are poorly understood. For centuries, Soppinabetta forests (SBFs) in the Western Ghats of India have provided essential habitat for wildlife and vital organic resources (leaf litter, green foliage) for the cultivation of betel nut palms (Areca catechu) and rice paddy (Oryza sativa). Historically, betel nut farmers carefully managed resource extraction in SBFs, but recent changes in land use policy allow for unmitigated resource extraction by site dwellers, which may imperil the traditional sustainable management of SBFs. Site dwellers live on government allotted sites and primarily derive their income through the sale of forest-based products. We used SBFs as a model system to investigate the factors governing: (i) forest resource extraction, (ii) the effect of changing agricultural practices on the rate of resource extraction, and (iii) farmers\xe2\x80\x99 perception of SBFs conservation in response to changes in governmental land use policy.

Organic resource harvesting by farmers was positively correlated with the size of betel nut plantations, size of SBFs, and number of livestock owned per household. Betel nut plantations require six times more compost than food grains cultivated in field paddies. In past one decade, 33% of field paddies have been converted into betel nut plantations, increasing the strain on SBFs for forest resources.

Title: 'Sustaining biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes in the Western Ghats: Remnant forests matter'

Abstract: 'AbstractHuman-modified tropical landscapes under semi-natural or agro-ecosystems often harbor biodiversity of significant conservation value. In the Western Ghats of India, these ecosystems also provide connectivity between protected areas and other remnant forests. We investigated the conservation value of these landscapes and agro-ecosystems using results from 35 studies covering 14 taxonomic groups. Large, conspicuous taxonomic groups and tree-covered land-use types have received much focus in this area of research in the Western Ghats. We computed a response ratio defined as the log ratio of species richness in human land use to species richness in forest control site from 17 studies. In a meta-analysis, we investigated variation of this ratio across studies with respect to three variables: taxonomic group, the land-use type sampled and the extent of forest cover within the study landscape. Higher forest cover within the landscape emerged as a major positive influence on biodiversity in human-modified landscapes for vertebrates and vegetation while no patterns emerged for invertebrates. Our results suggest that loss of remnant forest patches from these landscapes is likely to reduce biodiversity within agro-ecosystems and exacerbate overall biodiversity loss across the Western Ghats. Conservation of these remnant forest patches through protection and restoration of habitat and connectivity to larger forest patches needs to be prioritized. In the densely populated Western Ghats, this can only be achieved by building partnerships with local land owners and stakeholders through innovative land-use policy and incentive schemes for conservation.'

Title: 'Altered stand structure and tree allometry reduce carbon storage in evergreen forest fragments in India\xe2\x80\x99s Western Ghats'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We assessed fragmentation effects on forest structure, composition and carbon storage.\xe2\x80\xa2More open, shorter and softer wooded forest fragments store 40% less carbon.\xe2\x80\xa2Within species, trees in fragments are shorter for any given diameter.AbstractTropical forests are among the largest terrestrial reservoirs of carbon, and play an important role in regulating global climate. However, as a result of historic and ongoing deforestation, carbon storage in this biome is increasingly dependent on forests that are fragmented and used by humans, with considerable uncertainty about how such disturbance alters carbon storage potential and cycling. Here, we evaluate differences in above-ground carbon stocks between fragmented and contiguous evergreen forests in the central Western Ghats, India. We also assess differences in the structure, tree allometry and functional composition of forest stands between contiguous and fragmented forests, and explore how these differences influence carbon storage in fragmented forests. Relatively large, well-protected forest fragments currently store 40% less carbon per hectare above ground than contiguous forests. These differences in carbon are related to (i) lower tree density and basal area in fragments, (ii) lower average stand height in fragments, and (iii) compositional shifts favoring species with lower wood densities. Reduced stand height in fragments was associated with intra-specific variation in tree allometry, with trees in fragments being relatively shorter at any given diameter than conspecifics in contiguous forests. Further, the relatively skewed distribution of carbon storage within a few large trees in current-day fragments is added cause for concern: carbon stocks in fragments are likely to decline further in the future, following the eventual death of large trees. Active management and restoration to mitigate ecologically driven changes in habitat structure and species composition might be as important as improved management of resource use and protection from exploitation in order to sustain carbon storage ecosystem services provided by these tropical forest fragments.'

Title: 'The rain\xe2\x80\x93runoff response of tropical humid forest ecosystems to use and reforestation in the Western Ghats of India'

Abstract: 'SummaryThe effects of forest degradation and use and establishment of tree-plantations on degraded or modified forest ecosystems at multi-decadal time-scales using tree-plantations on the streamflow response are less studied in the humid tropics when compared to deforestation and forest conversion to agriculture. In the Western Ghats of India (Uttar Kannada, Karnataka State), a previous soil hydraulic conductivity survey linked with rain IDF (intensity\xe2\x80\x93duration\xe2\x80\x93frequency) had suggested a greater occurrence of infiltration-excess overland within the degraded forest and reforested areas and thus potentially higher streamflow (Bonell et al., 2010). We further tested these predictions in Uttar Kannada by establishing experimental basins ranging from 7 to 23\xc2\xa0ha across three ecosystems, (1) remnant tropical evergreen Forest (NF), (2) heavily-used former evergreen forest which now has been converted to tree savanna, known as degraded forest (DF) and (3) exotic Acacia plantations (AC, Acacia auriculiformis) on degraded former forest land. In total, 11 basins were instrumented (3 NF, 4 AC and 4 DF) in two geomorphological zones, i.e., Coastal and Up-Ghat (Malnaad) and at three sites (one Coastal, two Up-Ghat). The rainfall\xe2\x80\x93streamflow observations collected (at daily and also at a 36\xc2\xa0min time resolutions in the Coastal basins) over a 2\xe2\x80\x933\xc2\xa0year period (2003\xe2\x80\x932005) were analysed.In both the Coastal and Up-Ghat basins, the double mass curves showed during the rainy season a consistent trend in favour of more proportion of streamflow in the rank order DF\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0AC\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0NF. These double mass curves provide strong evidence that overland flow is progressively becomes a more dominant stormflow pathway. Across all sites, NF converted 28.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa06.41stdev% of rainfall into total streamflow in comparison to 32.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa06.97stdev% in AC and 45.3\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa09.61stdev% in DF.Further support for the above trends emerges from the quickflow ratio QF/Q for the Coastal basins. There are much higher values for both the DF and AC land covers, and their rank order DF\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0AC\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0NF. The quickflow response ratio QF/P is also the highest for the DF basin, and along with the QF/Q ratio, can exceed 90%. The corresponding delayed flow response ratios, QD/P clearly show the largest QD yields as a proportion of event precipitation from the Forest (NF1). The application of linear model supported these differences (e.g. 10\xe2\x80\x9336% difference between NF and DF, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001) in the storm hydrologic response of the Coastal basins. The exception was QF/P where there was a higher uncertainty connected with inter-basin mean differences. Cross-correlation plots for rain\xe2\x80\x93streamflow and corresponding lag regression models for three storm events in the Coastal basins suggested the existence of alternative stormflow pathways with multiple lags with peaks between \xe2\x88\xbc12 and 24\xc2\xa0h in NF, compared to respective bimodal peaks at \xe2\x88\xbc1 and 16\xc2\xa0h in AC and \xe2\x88\xbc1 and 12\xc2\xa0h in DF. The long time lags for NF are suggestive of deep subsurface stormflow and groundwater as the contributing sources to the storm hydrograph. The short time lags in DF and AC are indicative of overland flow and so \xe2\x80\x98memory\xe2\x80\x99 of the previous degraded land cover is retained in AC as supported by previous hydraulic conductivity data. As potential and actual evapotranspiration is likely to be depressed during the monsoon, differences in streamflow and run-off responses between land-cover types is largely attributed to differences in soil infiltration and hydrologic pathways. Enhancing infiltration and reducing run-off in managed ecosystems should be explored in the terms of the context of other ecosystem services and biodiversity.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Unique data on hydrologic effects of tropical reforestation and human-use. \xe2\x96\xba Clear evidence for the \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltration trade-off hypothesis\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x96\xba Comprehensive paper on hydrology of Western Ghats, a global biodiversity hotspot. \xe2\x96\xba Hydrologic processes across land-cover analysed using multiple approaches.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We assessed status of community-managed sacred groves (SG) in the Western Ghats.\xe2\x80\xa2Current extent and recent trends in forest cover and biomass were examined.\xe2\x80\xa2SG network smaller than officially reported, with biomass declines in recent years.\xe2\x80\xa2Local communities perceived encroachment and logging as threats to SG.\xe2\x80\xa2Dynamism in conservation status of SG highlights need for rigorous monitoring.AbstractAlthough the potential for community-conserved areas (CCAs) to extend conservation beyond formal protected areas is widely acknowledged, the scarcity of conservation assessments and monitoring hinders the rigorous evaluation of their effectiveness in many regions. In India, which hosts a high density and diversity of CCAs, the need for more assessments of the ecological and socio-economic properties of these systems to guide conservation planning and policy has been emphasised in recent years. We inventoried the extant sacred grove network against official records of 407 groves across 70 villages in the Kodagu District of India\xe2\x80\x99s Western Ghats, and interviewed local communities about their management and conservation. We also evaluated recent trends in aboveground biomass of sacred groves using time-series satellite data from six time-points during the 2000\xe2\x80\x932010 period, and made comparisons to corresponding trends in nearby State-managed protected forests. Although most of the larger (>2\xc2\xa0ha) groves officially listed were forested at present, over two-thirds of the smaller groves listed were either not forested or could not be located. Local communities attributed these declines to encroachment and illicit logging. Time-series satellite data revealed aboveground biomass declines of \xe2\x88\xbc0.5% annually across the sacred grove network over the 2000\xe2\x80\x932010 period. In contrast, biomass increased during this period at the interiors and edges of State-managed forests in the landscape. Our results highlight that the conservation status of even well-protected CCAs can vary considerably over time, especially given the dynamism in socio-economic, cultural and ecological factors that govern their status. We argue that understanding and addressing this dynamism is crucial to the conservation of CCAs.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Studies the effect of mixed forest cover on stream water quality in tropics.\xe2\x80\xa2Quantifies the impact of forest cover on important water quality parameters.\xe2\x80\xa2Observes contrasting response of the old and disturbed forests on water quality.\xe2\x80\xa2Observes tradeoff between provisioning services and hydrological services of forests.SummaryThe hydrological research has largely concentrated on two extremes \xe2\x80\x93 undisturbed forest cover versus cleared forest land, whereas most tropical forest areas are now a mix of secondary vegetation, and old forest interspersed with patches cleared for agriculture or other non-forest use (Bruijnzeel, 2004; Giambelluca, 2002). For this reason, research on spatiotemporal variations in the effects of a mix of primary forest, mature secondary forests and disturbed forests on stream water quality was conducted in four watersheds in the Western Ghats of peninsular India. The study indicated that every one percent decrease in the forest cover (all lands with tree cover of canopy density of 10% and above when projected vertically on the horizontal ground with minimum areal extent of one ha) increases turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS) and Escherichia coli by 8.41%, 4.17% and 3.91%, respectively as also decreases calcium hardness by 0.49%. However, when the forest cover was segregated into old forests (primary forest, mature secondary forest and undisturbed mature plantations) and, open and disturbed forests the old forests were observed to significantly improve (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) most water quality parameters. In contrast the open and disturbed forests were observed to deteriorate the observed water quality parameters except for turbidity and TSS. The magnitudes of regression coefficients indicated that the old forests were 2.2 and 2.74 times more effective than the disturbed forests in reducing turbidity and TSS, respectively. Tradeoffs between the provisioning services and water quality improvement services of the forest were apparent.'

A land\xe2\x80\x93sea contrast of an order of magnitude in the lightning activity is observed even in a small area across the western coast of India. The shape of a zone of high lightning activity formed almost parallel to the Western Ghats during the onset and withdrawal phases of monsoon, strongly suggests the effect of the Western Ghats in its formation. Seasonal variation of the lightning activity in this area and also in each of its four equal sectors (two each over the Arabian Sea and over land) is bi-annual with one peak each in the onset (May/June) and withdrawal months (September/October) of monsoon and a sharp dip to very low values during the monsoon months (July/August) of maximum seasonal rainfall. The lightning activity in each sector is found to increase over the 1998\xe2\x80\x932012 period. However, the increase in lightning activity over the sector containing Mumbai is found to be greater during the pre- and post-monsoon periods and smaller during the monsoon period as compared to an identical sector immediately south of it.'

Abstract: 'AbstractInvasions by exotic plants threaten the biodiversity and integrity of Protected Areas (PAs) by manipulating the species composition, the nutrient cycling and the hydrology prevailing in the specific habitat. Invasion of plant species in the natural ecosystem especially in the precincts of Western Ghats is due to rampant anthropogenic pressures. Complete assessment of the vegetation, richness distribution of Invasive Alien Species (IAS) and their association with the environmental drivers is essential to manage the PAs effectively. The present study analyses the richness of native vegetation with a comparative view on the distribution of Lantana camara, Chromolena odorata and Pteridium aquilinum in proposed Palani Hill National Park (PHNP), Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu. Secondly prepare models of the distribution of the target invasive species in the region. The biotic and abiotic data along with the vegetation type were generated and overlaid on IAS distribution to model the spread of target plant species. The study revealed that the distribution of invasive species negative relationship between the native species richness and positive relationship between the species dominance. Among the forest types dry evergreen, moist deciduous and tree savanna were found to be more vulnerable to invasion of Lantana camara and Chromolena odorata, wherein tree savanna and plantation were more vulnerable to invasion of Pteridium aquilinum. The information will strongly support effective management of Protected Areas.'

Abstract: 'AbstractUnplanned large scale developmental projects in recent times have been causing alterations in land use land cover [LULC] at spatial and temporal scales with the substantial changes in the landscape. Uttara Kannada district has the distinction of having highest forest cover in India. Forest ecosystems in the district have witnessed major transformations due to industrialization during the post-independence. Impact of developmental activities during the post-independence era, is evident from barren hill tops due to deforestation. The analysis of temporal spatial data acquired through space borne sensors highlights the decline of evergreen-semi evergreen forest cover from 67.73% (1973) to 32.08% (2013). The ad-hoc approaches adopted in the implementation of developmental projects in the ecologically sensitive regions has impaired the ecosystem services affecting the people\xe2\x80\x99s livelihood. The changes in the landscape structure with LULC changes have altered the functional abilities of an ecosystem evident from lowered hydrological yield, disappearing perennial streams, higher instances of human\xe2\x80\x93animal conflicts, declined ecosystem goods, etc. About 64355\xc2\xa0Ha of forest land is diverted for various non-forestry activities during the last four decades by the government apart from encroachment of 7072\xc2\xa0Ha of forest area for agriculture, horticulture activities, etc. Encroachment of forest land has resulted in the land degradation leading to reduced productivity. Alterations in bio-geo chemical and hydrological cycles have necessitated the restoration of native forests in the region to ensure water and food security, and livelihood of the local people. Monitoring and visualization of landscape dynamics helps in evolving appropriate management strategies. LULC dynamics analyses considering agents (developmental projects) through fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) integrated with Markov cellular automata (CA) indicate the developmental projects such as West Coast Paper Mill (WCPM) and Kaiga Nuclear Power House (KNPH) will lead to further fragmentation of forests with spurt in urbanization by 2022.

Satellite data on the occurrence of hotspots and statistical data were used to analyse the distribution characteristics of wildfires for 2008\xe2\x80\x932012.

The size of 99% of forest fires was less than 100\xc2\xa0ha, and the average annual burned area was 124,192\xc2\xa0ha. Most of the forest fires occurred in the spring (accounting for 83%), with March having the highest rate (60.0%). Forest fires were mainly distributed in the south and southwest regions of China. In total, 72.2% of the forest fires occurred in humid region of the medium temperate zone, and 54% occurred in regions with altitudes lower than 500\xc2\xa0m. Forest fires often occurred in sparsely populated areas (<100\xc2\xa0people/km2), and 58% and 44% of the fires were located in areas away from the road (<5\xc2\xa0km) and around settlements (<1\xc2\xa0km), respectively.'

An Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) was used to measure the mass concentration of non-refractory particulate matter (NR-PM1) at a high-altitude site in the Western Ghats, India from March 2016 to February 2017. The mass concentration of NR-PM1 averaged at 7.5\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf6.5\xe2\x80\xaf\xce\xbcgm\xe2\x80\x933, with major contributions from organics (59%) and sulfates (23%). Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied on the measured mass spectra of organic aerosol (OA) to derive the sources distinctive of each season (Summer, Monsoon, Post-Monsoon and Winter). The four OA factors (two primary OA and two oxygenated OA) resolved during summer, post-monsoon and winter season. However, only one oxygenated factor resolved during monsoon and contributed only 20% to the total OA. The factors associated with primary emissions dominated during the monsoon, whereas factors related to secondary formation dominated in other three seasons. During summer, an isoprene derived SOA \xe2\x80\x93 IEPOX-OA (isoprene-epoxydiol OA) contributed \xe2\x88\xbc17% to the total OA. Cluster and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) analyses were performed to identify the possible source regions of NR-PM1 mass concentration observed at the receptor site. The analysis identifies Central India as the potential source region of transported aerosol during post-monsoon and winter season. Our study suggests that contributions from both local sources and regional transport are important in governing mass concentration of PM1 over Mahabaleshwar.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (362KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'The impact of forest use and reforestation on soil hydraulic conductivity in the Western Ghats of India: Implications for surface and sub-surface hydrology'

Abstract: 'SummaryThere is comparatively limited information in the humid tropics on the surface and sub-surface permeability of: (i) forests which have been impacted by multi-decades of human occupancy and (ii) forestation of land in various states of degradation. Even less is known about the dominant stormflow pathways for these respective scenarios. We sampled field saturated hydraulic conductivity, K\xe2\x88\x97 at 23 sites at four depths (0\xc2\xa0m, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0166), (0.10\xc2\xa0m, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0139), 0.45\xe2\x80\x930.60\xc2\xa0m, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0117, (1.35\xe2\x80\x931.50\xc2\xa0m, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0117) under less disturbed forest (Forest), disturbed production forest of various local species (Degraded Forest) and tree-plantations (Acacia auriculiformes, 7\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0years old, Tectona grandis, \xe2\x88\xbc25\xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xa0years old, Casuarina equisetifolia, 12\xc2\xa0years old) in the Uttar Kannada district, Karnataka, India, in the Western Ghats. The sampling strategy was also undertaken across three physiographic blocks and under three main soil types. Subsequently the determined K\xe2\x88\x97 were then linked with rainfall intensity\xe2\x80\x93duration\xe2\x80\x93frequency (IDF) characteristics to infer the dominant stormflow pathways.The Degraded Forest shows an order of magnitude decline in K\xe2\x88\x97 at the surface as result of human impacts at decadal to century time scales. The lowest surface permeability is associated with the Degraded Forests over the Laterite (Eutric Nitosols and Acrisols) and Red soils (Eutric Nitosols) and infiltration-excess overland flow, IOF probably occurs. Further there is a progressive decline in K\xe2\x88\x97 with depth in these soils supporting Degraded Forests. The A. auriculiformes plantations over the Red and Lateritic soils are progressively restoring the near-surface K\xe2\x88\x97, but their K\xe2\x88\x97 still remain quite low when compared to the less disturbed forest permeability. Consequently these plantations still retain the \xe2\x80\x98memory\xe2\x80\x99 from the previous degraded state. In contrast the permeability of the Black soils (Vertisols) are relatively insensitive to T. grandis plantations and this soil group has a very low K\xe2\x88\x97, irrespective of land cover, so that IOF likely prevails. Overall, the Laterites are the most variable in K\xe2\x88\x97 when compared to the other soil groups. Thus when compared to other studies, IOF is probably more prevalent in this region. More especially so, when taking into account the marked reduction in surface K\xe2\x88\x97 during the wet season when compared to dry season measurements. In addition, we have demonstrated the potential for the \xe2\x80\x98infiltration \xe2\x80\x93 trade-off\xe2\x80\x99 hypothesis to be realized in this landscape under certain conditions of land degradation and restoration. It is most relevant to the combination of degraded sites and A. auriculiformes plantations on Red or Laterite soils using the less disturbed forests as the baseline. The intensity of forest use and effects of monoculture plantations on soil ecology (relative to native, mixed forests) is likely to be the critical factor in affecting surface K\xe2\x88\x97 over time. Predicted changes in the intensity of rain events in the future is likely to enhance overland flow on degraded sites on all soils and especially on Black soils, and restoration efforts by all stake-holders, preferably using native or non-invasive species, are needed to address this concern.'

Title: 'Spatiotemporal analysis of the effects of forest covers on water yield in the Western Ghats of peninsular India'
Author: 'Sunita'

Abstract: 'SummaryBiotic interference has greatly disturbed the forest cover, the forest soils and, therefore, the hydrological functioning of the forest (Bonell and Bruijnzeel, 2005). Though widely debated, reduction in water yield (Water Yield: Total quantity of surface water that can be expected in a given period from a stream at the outlet of its catchment (Subramanya, 2008)) appears to be one such consequence. Scientific understanding of how this contentious issue affects the benefits of forests for water is critical to avoid unintended consequences (IUFRO, 2007). Gaps in research exist for tropical forest areas that are now a general mix of primary forest and secondary vegetation interspersed with patches cleared for agriculture or other non-forest uses (Bruijnzeel, 2004, Giambelluca, 2002). For this reason, research on spatiotemporal variations in the effects of a mix of primary forest (Primary Forests: Old forests with no or inconsequential human disturbance), mature secondary forests (Secondary Forests: Forests regenerating largely through natural processes after significant human and/or natural disturbance of the original forest vegetation at a single point in time or over an extended period, and displaying a major difference in forest structure and/or canopy species composition with respect to nearby primary forests on similar sites (Chokkalingam and Jong, 2001)) and disturbed forests (Disturbed Forests: Forests that have been exploited on moderate to large scale for timber, fuel wood, fodder, shifting cultivation and other tangible benefits. Reforestation activities may or may not have been undertaken in them) on runoff coefficients was conducted in four watersheds in the Western Ghats of peninsular India. Forest cover (Forest Cover: All lands with tree cover of canopy density of 10% and above when projected vertically on the horizontal ground with minimum areal extent of one Ha) significantly (0.01\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa0p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) and positively influenced the runoff coefficient and, thus, the water yield. Despite wide variations in the forest cover, the Tulsi Watershed having mainly primary forests, the Tansa having over 52% forest cover of primary and mature secondary forests and nearly 60\xe2\x80\x9370% of forest cover of Bhatsa and Upper Vaitarna being disturbed forests, the impact of forest cover on runoff coefficient did not vary significantly from one watershed to the other. However, when the forest cover was segregated into old forests (primary forest, mature secondary forest and undisturbed mature plantations) and mixed forests (disturbed forests and to lesser extent naturally occurring open forest (Open Forests: All lands with tree cover of canopy density between 10% and 40%)), the old forests were observed to positively and highly significantly (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01) influence runoff coefficient. In contrast, the mixed forests exhibited negative trend that was not statistically significant.

Abstract: 'SummaryAn understanding of the soil moisture variability is necessary to characterize the linkages between a region\xe2\x80\x99s hydrology, ecology and physiography. In the changing land use scenario of Western Ghats, India, where deforestation along with extensive afforestation with exotic species is being undertaken, there is an urgent need to evaluate the impacts of these changes on regional hydrology. The objectives of the present study were: (a) to understand spatio-temporal variability of soil water potential and soil moisture content under different land covers in the humid tropical Western Ghats region and (b) to evaluate differences if any in spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture content as influenced by nature of land cover. To this end, experimental watersheds located in the Western Ghats of Uttara Kannada District, Karnataka State, India, were established for monitoring of soil moisture. These watersheds possessed homogenous land covers of acacia plantation, natural forest and degraded forest. In addition to the measurements of hydro-meteorological parameters, soil matric potential measurements were made at four locations in each watershed at 50\xc2\xa0cm, 100\xc2\xa0cm and 150\xc2\xa0cm depths at weekly time intervals during the period October 2004\xe2\x80\x93December 2008.Soil moisture contents derived from potential measurements collected were analyzed to characterize the spatial and temporal variations across the three land covers. The results of ANOVA (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01, LSD) test indicated that there was no significant change in the mean soil moisture across land covers. However, significant differences in soil moisture with depth were observed under forested watershed, whereas no such changes with depth were noticed under acacia and degraded land covers. Also, relationships between soil moisture at different depths were evaluated using correlation analysis and multiple linear regression models for prediction of soil moisture from climatic variables and antecedent moisture condition were developed and tested. A regression model relating near-surface soil moisture (50\xc2\xa0cm) with profile soil moisture content was developed which may prove useful when surface soil moisture contents derived from satellite remote sensing are available. Overall results of this study indicate that while the nature of land cover has an influence on the spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture, other variables related to topography may have a more dominant effect.Research highlights\xe2\x96\xba Monitored soil moisture under natural forest, degraded forest and acacia. \xe2\x96\xba Analyzed spatial and temporal variations in weekly moisture contents. \xe2\x96\xba Mean soil moisture content was not significantly different between land covers. \xe2\x96\xba Developed and validated statistical soil moisture prediction models.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Current study provides spatial information of intact forest landscapes of India.\xe2\x80\xa2About 5.4% of the total natural forest remained as intact in India.\xe2\x80\xa2The spatial database generated stands as scientific input for the identification of new protected areas.\xe2\x80\xa2The monitoring of changes in intact forest landscapes help in future conservation programs.AbstractThere is an increased interest in identifying the status of biodiversity in different spatial and temporal scales. The objective of the current research is to prepare a consistent spatial database of intact forest landscapes of India. The intact forest landscapes are located in the Himalayas, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Western Ghats and Sunderbans. At national level 237 forest landscapes and 5.4% of the total natural forest remained as intact in India. Current intact forest landscapes of India consists of blocks larger than 10\xc2\xa0km2 covering an area of 34,061\xc2\xa0km2. Of the total area under intact forest landscapes, Eastern Himalayas represent 76.7% of the area, followed by Western Himalayas (8.8%), Andaman & Nicobar Islands (6.2%) and Western Ghats (5.7%). The largest intact forest landscape block occupies an area of 3342.9\xc2\xa0km2 (9.8%) is found in western Arunachal Pradesh. Temperate forest zone represents the highest intactness (56.6%), followed by subtropical zone (19.2%), tropical zone (18.6%) and alpine zone (5.6%). Himalayan moist temperate forests represent the highest area (39.1%) of intact forest landscapes followed by subtropical broad-leaved hill forests, wet evergreen forests, and montane wet temperate forests. It is estimated that 4.4% of the area of intact forest landscapes fall inside the existing 47 protected areas. The results of the analysis best suited as input for the process of identification of new protected areas. The study recommends fine-scale mapping of biodiversity within the intact forest landscapes and to prepare efficient conservation plans.'

We report the estimates of forest carbon pool and its spatial distribution in the Indian forests for the years 1994 and 2010 at 5\xc2\xa0km grid level. This study improves upon earlier spatial estimates of Indian forest biomass carbon by using data from a robustly designed National Forest Inventory (NFI). The realized sampling intensity has addressed the large heterogeneity of the Indian forest types and allowed the computation of 5\xc2\xa0km grid level forest C, yielding a realistic estimate of forest biomass C in Indian forests. Forest cover density maps were intersected with 5\xc2\xa0km mesh and estimates of forest area, forest carbon density for each Agro-ecological sub region and forest carbon pools were linked to the 5\xc2\xa0km grid coverage of India. National forest carbon estimates for the years 1994 and 2010 are 3911.78 and 4368.03\xc2\xa0TgC respectively, and these estimates showed a net increase of 456.25\xc2\xa0TgC in 16\xc2\xa0years. Uncertainty of the estimates has been addressed spatially. Mean forest carbon density increased from 61.14\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in 1994 to 64.08\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in 2010. C densities for dense and open forest in 1994 estimated as 77.08 and 38.47\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 with total C pools of 2895.28\xc2\xa0TgC and 1016.50\xc2\xa0TgC which has increased to 80.24\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 41.69\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 with total C pools of 3176.48\xc2\xa0TgC and 1191.55\xc2\xa0TgC in 2010. This study provides the first 5\xc2\xa0km level C analysis for Indian forests. Spatial distribution of C shows large differences in C density over Indian forests indicating that estimates of the spatial distribution of C are even more important than the total C pool estimates of the country.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (355KB)Download full-size image'

In the present study, temporal variability associated with mass concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, and PM1.0 were analysed using ground observations from Mahabaleswar (1348\xc2\xa0m AMSL, 17.56 0N, 73.4 0E), a high-altitude station in the Western Ghats, India from June 2012 to May 2013. Concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, and PM1.0 showed strong diurnal, monthly, seasonal and weekday-weekend trends. The seasonal variation of PM1.0 and PM2.5 has showed highest concentrations during winter season compared to monsoon and pre-monsoon, but in the case of PM10 it showed highest concentrations in pre-monsoon season. Similarly, slightly higher PM concentrations were observed during weekends compared to weekdays. In addition, possible contributing factors to this temporal variability has been analysed based on the variation of secondary pollutants such as NO2, SO2, CO and O3 and long range transport of dust.'

Title: 'ReviewFinding the anthropocene in tropical forests'
Author: 'Patrick'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221330541830033X
Abstract: 'AbstractCommonly proposed definitions of the "anthropocene" suggest that significant human alteration of the Earth system is connected to fossil fuel consumption coinciding with the Industrial Revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries, or global change resulting from the "Great Acceleration" following the Second World War. Although evidence for earlier, anthropogenically-driven environmental changes are acknowledged, they are seen as qualitatively different. This perspective is also prevalent in conservation and ecological discussions of human impacts on tropical forests. A growing body of archaeological and historical evidence demonstrates, however, that humans influenced physical, chemical, and biological systems through large regions of tropical forest starting as early as 45,000 years ago. This evidence challenges the idea, prevalent in global scenarios of anthropogenic land cover change, that human influence on tropical forests was limited until the colonial or industrial era. This paper reviews the role of tropical forests in the Earth system and, through a synthesis of archaeological data, critiques the prevailing view of anthropogenic influence on tropical forests in the pre-industrial world. We suggest that any definition of the anthropocene should account for the long history of human modifications to tropical forests. Archaeological and palaeoenvironmental research in these ecosystems is also critical to the broader debates in the social and natural sciences around the onset and utility of the anthropocene concept, and the potential for long-term, sustainable occupation of tropical forest environments.'

Abstract: 'AbstractKyasanur forest disease (KFD) is a zoonotic viral haemorrhagic fever and has been endemic to Karnataka State, India. Outbreaks of KFD were reported in new areas of Wayanad and Malappuram districts of Kerala, India during 2014\xe2\x80\x932015. Investigation of the outbreaks was carried out in these districts during May 2015. The line-list data of KFD cases available with District Medical Office, Wayanad were analysed. Case investigation was carried out to determine the risk factors associated with the outbreak and possible site of contraction infections. Ticks from the forest floor were collected in areas associated with monkey deaths by flagging method to estimate species abundance. Of 102 confirmed cases of KFD reported in Wayanad, 91% were adults aged >15years. About 43% of the cases were from the areas of Poothady Primary Health Centre (PHC) followed by Chethalayam PHC (22%). Most of the affected individuals belong to Kattunayakan tribe, dependent on forest for their livelihood. Those tribes are engaged in trench digging and fire line works in summer months and hence are at a higher risk. In Malappuram, the Cholanaickan tribe, are under high risk of exposure to infected ticks as they live deep in the forest and trap monkeys for game meat. High abundance of Haemaphysalis spinigera and H. turturis, the established vectors of KFD virus was recorded in all affected areas. Incidence of KFD cases/monkey deaths and high abundance of Haemaphysalis vectors in the forest ranges of Wayanad and Malappuram districts indicate that the area has become receptive for KFD outbreaks. Preventive measures (vaccination of high risk groups) coupled with intensive health education should be carried out prior to transmission season.'

Title: 'Resilience of an ancient tropical forest landscape to 7500\xc2\xa0years of environmental change'

Abstract: 'AbstractThere is growing recognition that the fate of the world\xe2\x80\x99s terrestrial biodiversity depends on the management of human-dominated tropical forest landscapes. While global environmental change is transforming the ecology of tropical forests, a number of studies have also demonstrated that tropical forests are able to recover following disturbance. But are tropical forests resilient to environmental and anthropogenic disturbances over timescales of centuries or millennia? Here we examine the relationship between vegetation cover and variation in monsoon rainfall, soil erosion, and fire over 7500\xc2\xa0years in an ancient tropical landscape in the Western Ghats of India. We collected two overlapping sediment sequences at one study site and analysed them with palaeoecological techniques to reconstruct vegetation cover. Results suggest that climate and land-use changes might have had synergistic effects on this forested landscape, although the relationship between these factors and vegetation cover has varied over time. Results also indicate that the weakening of monsoon around 5750 BP might have caused a threshold event altering this landscape to a low tree-cover state. Although anthropogenic fire has maintained this landscape in low tree cover state from 3500 BP, this degraded tree\xe2\x80\x93grassland mosaic has remained relatively resilient to fluctuations in environmental and anthropogenic factors. Tree taxa present throughout the sequence have lighter seeds than those absent in parts of the sequence, suggesting that dispersal mode might be an important factor in their persistence. Despite maintaining a degraded and fragmented forest mosaic, however, this landscape has supported populations of heavy-seeded trees and a probable refuge to their dispersal agents. We suggest that retaining tree cover on this landscape, even if fragmented, is key to maintaining its ecological resilience to environmental and anthropogenic disturbance.'

Title: 'Poverty, biodiversity and institutions in forest-agriculture ecotones in the Western Ghats and Eastern Himalaya ranges of India'
Author: 'Kamaljit S.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880906004518
Abstract: "AbstractForest-agricultural ecotones are defined as areas that adjoin forests and other natural habitats and that lie between forests and zones of intensive agriculture. These ecotones are critical for conservation of biodiversity and for the maintenance of livelihoods of people that inhabit these areas. Here we focus on three questions: (1) How can we make land use sustainable in forest-agriculture ecotones? (2) How can forest-agriculture ecotones contribute to conservation of biodiversity? (3) How can we improve the institutions that foster sustainability and conservation of biodiversity in forest-agriculture ecotones? We address these questions in the context of interventions to foster biodiversity and rural livelihoods made by the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bangalore, in the Western Ghats and the Eastern Himalayas, 2 of the 34 global hotspots of biodiversity in India. At several sites, ATREE's interventions have improved the livelihoods of several rural communities by providing increased income from non-timber forest products (NTFPs), diversification of livelihoods and enhanced agricultural production. These interventions have improved the prospects for sustainable land use in the forest-agriculture ecotones. Simultaneously, ATREE's interventions have strengthened a range of village level and regional institutions that play a critical role in the rural economy and in conservation of biodiversity. We believe that the path to sustainability in agriculture as well as maintenance of biodiversity passes through adaptive, strong and relevant institutions. The development of institutions however is severely constrained by low social and human capital and the neglect of forest-agriculture ecotones by the governmental agencies and international organizations. We argue that forest-agriculture ecotones offer a means to conserve biodiversity through alleviation of poverty and development of community-based institutions."

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The results were useful for identifying preferential areas of fire risk.\xe2\x80\xa2A simple model with global application displayed on a single map.\xe2\x80\xa2With this model, prevention measures can be taken in advance of forest fires.AbstractA forest fire risk map is a basic element for planning and protecting forested areas. The main goal of this study was to develop a statistical model for preparing a forest fire risk map using GIS. Such model is based on assigning weights to nine variables divided into two classes: physical factors of the site (terrain slope, land-use/occupation, proximity to roads, terrain orientation, and altitude) and climatic factors (precipitation, temperature, water deficit, and evapotranspiration). In regions where the climate is different from the conditions of this study, the model will require an adjustment of the variables weights according to the local climate. The study area, Esp\xc3\xadrito Santo State, exhibited approximately 3.81% low risk, 21.18% moderate risk, 30.10% high risk, 41.50% very high risk, and 3.40% extreme risk of forest fire. The areas classified as high risk, very high and extreme, contemplated a total of 78.92% of heat spots.'

Abstract: 'AbstractLitter production, standing crop of litter on forest floor and leaf-litter decomposition of selected dominant tree species were studied in the tropical forests at Kodayar in the Western Ghats, India. Mean annual litterfall in the study sites ranged from 5.63 to 8.65\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921. A greater amount of annual litter production was observed in sites II and III, when compared to sites I and IV. This variation in litterfall pattern among the sites could be attributed to species composition. Monthly variation in litterfall pattern showed two peaks, one in the dry season (January\xe2\x80\x93April) and another in November. Contribution of leaf litter to the total litter was significantly (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01) greater compared to other components (woody litter and reproductive parts). In deciduous forests, Terminalia contributed significantly (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) greater amount of leaf litter to annual litter production, followed by Careya arborea, Macaranga peltata, Aporosa lindleyana and Dillenia pentagyna, whereas in evergreen forests, Hopea parviflora contributed the most. The results suggest that species composition and their contribution toward litter becomes important in overall community or site litter production as observed in sites II and III. The litter mass decreased linearly with time. Thin and smooth leaf without prominent skeletal tissues decomposed more rapidly, while thick and tough leaves with prominent midribs and veins took longer time for complete decomposition. The species with high nitrogen content exhibited relatively faster decomposition except in H. parviflora and V. indica. The differences in decay rates and half-life periods are related to structure and nutrient concentration of leaf litter and the environmental factors.'

Abstract: 'AbstractHabitat fragmentation, land cover change and biodiversity loss are often associated with village communities in protected areas, but the extent and intensity of such impacts are often inadequately assessed.

We examined the occurrence of 10 regionally-specific ecological indicators that encompassed several aspects of human activities. Thirty transects with 180 total sampling locations recorded the occurrence of these specific habitat disturbance variables. High correlations between the variables led to the use of principal component analysis to derive an effective summary index that reflected disturbance intensity and determined village ecological impacts spatially. A generalized linear model was fit to determine the rate at which disturbance decreases as we move away from village centers. Our model indicates that village size class, distance from the village and proximity to other villages were significant predictors of the disturbance index. The index distinguished each village\xe2\x80\x99s spatially explicit ecological impact.

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Unique data on hydrologic effects of tropical reforestation and human-use.\xe2\x80\xa2Clear evidence for the \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltration-evapotranspiration trade-off hypothesis\xe2\x80\x9d in relation to hydrologic services.\xe2\x80\xa2Comprehensive paper on hydrology of Western Ghats, a globalbiodiversity hotspot.\xe2\x80\xa2Hydrologic processes and recharge to ground-water across land-coveranalyzed using multiple approaches and spatial scales.SummaryThe hydrologic effects of forest use and reforestation of degraded lands in the humid tropics has implications for local and regional hydrologic services but such issues have been relatively less studied when compared to the impacts of forest conversion. In particular, the \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltration-evapotranspiration trade-off\xe2\x80\x9d hypothesis which predicts a net gain or loss to baseflow and dry-season flow under both, forest degradation or reforestation depending on conditions has not been tested adequately. In the Western Ghats of India, we examined the hydrologic responses and groundwater recharge and hydrologic services linked with three ecosystems, (1) remnant tropical evergreen forest (NF), (2) heavily-used former evergreen forest which now has been converted to tree savanna, known as degraded forest(DF), and (3) exotic Acacia plantations (AC, Acacia auriculiformis) on degraded former forest land. Instrumented catchments ranging from 7 to 23\xc2\xa0ha representing these three land-covers (3 NF, 4 AC and 4 DF, in total 11 basins), were established and maintained between 2003 and 2005 at three sites in two geomorphological zones, Coastal and Up-Ghat (Malnaad). Four larger (1\xe2\x80\x932\xc2\xa0km2) catchments downstream of the head-water catchments in the Malnaad with varying proportions of different land-cover and providing irrigation water for areca-nut and paddy rice were also measured for post-monsoon baseflow. Daily hydrological and climate data was available at all the sites. In addition, 36\xc2\xa0min data was available at the Coastal site for 41\xc2\xa0days as part of the opening phase of the summer monsoon, June\xe2\x80\x93July 2005.Low potential and actual evapotranspiration rates during the monsoon that are similar across all land-cover ensures that the main control on the extent of groundwater recharge during the south-west monsoon is the proportion of rainfall that is converted into quick flow rather than differences in evapotranspiration between the different land cover types. The Flow duration curves demonstrated a higher frequency and longer duration of low flows under NF when compared to the other more disturbed land covers in both the Coastal and Malnaad basins. Groundwater recharge estimated using water balance during the wet-season in the Coastal basins under NF, AC and DF was estimated to be 50%, 46% and 35% respectively and in the Malnaad it was 61%, 55% and 36% respectively. Soil Water Infiltration and Movement (SWIM) based recharge estimates also support the pattern (46% in NF; 39% in AC and 14% in DF). Furey\xe2\x80\x93Gupta filter based estimates associated with the Coastal basins also suggest similar groundwater recharge values and trends across the respective land-covers: 69% in NF, 49% in AC, and 42% in DF. Soil water potential profiles using zero flux plane methods suggest that during the dry-season, natural forests depend on deep soil moisture and groundwater. Catchments with higher proportion of forest cover upstream were observed to sustain flow longer into the dry-season. These hydrologic responses provide some support towards the \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltration-evapotranspiration trade-off\xe2\x80\x9d hypothesis in which differences in infiltration between land-cover rather than evapotranspiration determines the differences in groundwater recharge, low flows and dry-season flow. Groundwater recharge is the most temporally stable under natural forest, although substantial recharge occurs under all three ecosystems, which helps to sustain dry-season flow downstream in higher order streams that sustain local communities and agro-ecosystems. In addition to spatial scale effects, greater attention also needs to be given to the role of hydrogeology within the context of the above hypothesis and its implications for hydrologic services.'

Title: 'Use and cultivation of plants that yield products other than timber from South Asian tropical forests, and their potential in forest restoration'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2A review of a history of non-timber forest product use within tropical forests.\xe2\x80\xa2A set of ecological principles for categorizing the ecology and growth of NTFP\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\xa2A framework for incorporating non-timber products into forest restoration.\xe2\x80\xa2A synthesis on the ecology and silviculture of non-timber forest products.AbstractRural communities have traditionally valued forests for a diversity of products and services, with timber serving a minor role. No-where has this diversity been greater than in tropical South Asia, and in particular south India and Sri Lanka. As economies advance towards full development and populations become increasingly urbanized, forests become increasingly valued for their services. National development generally occurs at differing rates in different regions, with rural forest dependent communities falling behind and pockets of poverty long remaining. The demand for \xe2\x80\x98non-timber forest products\xe2\x80\x99 (NTFPs) therefore changes from subsistence to monetary based values. Overall, though, forests have suffered an unprecedented decline with development in the tropics, especially in Asia. This necessitates restoration which takes account of the enrichment of economy, wellbeing and culture which forest products provide. Methods for such restoration, and the fundamental principles upon which these must rest, are presented for species yielding NTFP\xe2\x80\x99s. In this paper we first review the history of NTFP species use within south India and Sri Lanka. Second we provide a description of the broad regional characterizations of the forest formations within this region in relation to their affiliated patterns of NTFP use and exploitation. We consider seven guilds as a way to categorize NTFP\xe2\x80\x99s into autecological groups for application in restoration silviculture, and use it as a framework to suggest restoration protocols for South Asian forests. We use examples of scenarios based on experimental studies of NTFP\xe2\x80\x99s in reforestation trials which take account of different social values and land tenures. We conclude with a call for further research.'

Title: 'Assessment of diversity among populations of Rauvolfia serpentina Benth. Ex. Kurtz. from Southern Western Ghats of India, based on chemical profiling, horticultural traits and RAPD analysis'

Abstract: 'AbstractGenetic, morphological and chemical variations of ten natural populations of Rauvolfia serpentina Benth. Ex. Kurtz. from Southern Western Ghats of India were assessed using RAPD markers reserpine content and morphological traits. An estimate of genetic diversity and differentiation between genotypes of breeding germplasm is of key importance for its improvement. Populations were collected from different geographical regions. Data obtained through three different methods were compared and the correlation among them was estimated. Statistical analysis showed significant differences for all horticultural characteristics among the accessions suggesting that selection for relevant characteristics could be possible. Variation in the content of Reserpine ranges from 0.192\xc2\xa0g/100\xc2\xa0g (population from Tusharagiri) to 1.312\xc2\xa0g/100\xc2\xa0g (population from Aryankavu). A high diversity within population and high genetic differentiation among them based on RAPDs were revealed caused both by habitat fragmentation of the low size of most populations and the low level of gene flow among them. The UPGMA dendrogram and PCA analysis based on reserpine content yielded higher separation among populations indicated specific adaptation of populations into clusters each of them including populations closed to their geographical origin. Genetic, chemical and morphological data were correlated based on Mantel test. Given the high differentiation among populations conservation strategies should take into account genetic diversity and chemical variation levels in relation to bioclimatic and geographic location of populations. Our results also indicate that RAPD approach along with horticultural analysis seemed to be best suited for assessing with high accuracy the genetic relationships among distinct R. serpentina accessions.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (215KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Altitude decrease liana diversity while patch size increases.\xe2\x80\xa2Disturbance alters liana diversity responses.\xe2\x80\xa2Lianas play a vital role in montane forest succession.AbstractThe species richness and density of lianas (woody vines) in tropical forests is determined by various abiotic and biotic factors. Factors such as altitude, forest patch size and the degree of forest disturbance are known to exert strong influences on liana species richness and density. We investigated how liana species richness and density were concurrently influenced by altitude (1700\xe2\x80\x932360\xc2\xa0m), forest patch size, forest patch location (edge or interior) and disturbance intensity in the tropical montane evergreen forests, of the Nilgiri and Palni hills, Western Ghats, southern India. All woody lianas (\xe2\x89\xa51\xc2\xa0cm dbh) were enumerated in plots of 30\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa030\xc2\xa0m in small, medium and large forest patches, which were located along an altitudinal gradient ranging from 1700 to 2360\xc2\xa0m. A total of 1980 individual lianas were recorded, belonging to 45 species, 32 genera and 21 families, from a total sampling area of 13.86\xc2\xa0ha (across 154 plots). Liana species richness and density decreased significantly with increasing altitude and increased with increasing forest patch size. Within forest patches, the proportion of forest edge or interior habitat influenced liana distribution and succession especially when compared across the patch size categories. Liana species richness and density also varied along the altitudinal gradient when examined using eco-physiological guilds (i.e. shade tolerance, dispersal mode and climbing mechanism). The species richness and density of lianas within these ecological guilds responded negatively to increasing altitude and positively to increasing patch size and additionally displayed differing sensitivities to forest disturbance. Importantly, the degree of forest disturbance significantly altered the relationship between liana species richness and density to increasing altitude and patches size, and as such is likely the primary influence on liana response to montane forest succession. Our findings suggest that managing forest disturbance in the examined montane forests would assist in conserving local liana diversity across the examined altitudinal range.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe growth and allocation patterns of biomass and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) were studied in Chromolaena odorata populations grown in different human modified ecosystems including an\xc2\xa0Albizia plantation, a rubber plantation, community land and a naturally regenerating forest. The greater shoot length of C. odorata in the regenerating forest could be attributed to the competitive and shady environment created by the mature vegetation here. High relative growth rate, net assimilation rate and\xc2\xa0reproductive potential of C. odorata populations growing on the community land and in the rubber plantation may be due to the open habitat and frequent disturbances to these sites. In general, allocation of biomass and nutrients to the leaf and reproductive components was low in the regenerating forest.

Low nutrient uptake and greater resource use efficiency in\xc2\xa0the regenerating forest could be a response to limited resource availability under the competitive micro-environment created by the fast growing tree species. C. odorata has an exploitative growth strategy and will persist in regenerating open habitats whereas it showed suppressed growth in the light \xe2\x80\x93 limited shaded environment.'

Title: 'Patterns of spatiotemporal change in large mammal distribution and abundance in the southern Western Ghats, India'
Author: 'Rajeev'

Abstract: 'AbstractLarge mammals face high risks of anthropogenic extinction owing to their larger body mass and associated life history traits. Recent worldwide mammal declines have highlighted the conservation importance of effective assessments of trends in distribution and abundance of species. Yet reliable data depicting the nature and extent of changes in population parameters is sparse, primarily due to logistical problems in covering large areas and difficulties in obtaining reliable information at large spatial scales, particularly over time. We used key informant surveys to generate detection histories for 18 species of large mammals (body mass\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa02\xc2\xa0kg) at two points in time (present and 30\xc2\xa0years ago) in the Southern subregion of the Western Ghats global biodiversity hotspot. Multiple-season occupancy models were used to assess temporal trends in occupancy, detectability and vital rates of extinction and colonization for each species. Our results show significant declines in distribution for large carnivores, the Asian elephant and endemic ungulates and primates. There is a significant decline in detectability for 16 species, which suggests a decline in their abundance. These patterns of change in distribution and abundance repeat in our assessments of spatial variation in occupancy dynamics between the three contiguous forest complexes and two human-dominated landscapes into which the southern Western Ghats has been fragmented. Extinction rates are highest in the human-dominated landscapes. Declines in abundance for several species suggest the presence of extinction debts, which may soon be repaid with imminent range contractions and subsequent species extinctions unless immediate remedial conservation measures are taken. Detection/non-detection surveys of key informants used in an occupancy modeling framework provide potential for rapid conservation status assessments of multiple species across large spatial scales over time.'

Title: 'The formation of fire residues associated with hunter-gatherers in humid tropical environments: A geo-ethnoarchaeological perspective'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Multi-proxy micro-geoarchaeological approach is suggested to study fire in tropical forests.\xe2\x80\xa2Hearths by immediate-return hunter-gatherers are ephemeral leaving a low signal.\xe2\x80\xa2Waste areas better preserve fire residues but in a secondary context.\xe2\x80\xa2Humid tropical environments are characterised by acidity and intensive biological activity.\xe2\x80\xa2In humid tropical environments charcoal and phytolith preserve better than ash and bone.AbstractTropical forests have been an important human habitat and played a significant role in early human dispersal and evolution. Likewise, the use of fire, besides being one of the exceptional characteristics of humans, serves as a marker for human evolution. While the use of fire by prehistoric hunter-gatherers is relatively well documented in arid and temperate environments, the archaeological evidence in humid tropical environment is to date very limited. We first review the archaeological evidence for hunter-gatherer use of fire in humid tropical environments and suggest that better understanding of formation processes is required. We present a geo-ethnoarchaeological study from South India, involving ethnography, excavations and laboratory-based analyses in order to build a new framework to study fire residues in humid tropical forests associated with hunter-gatherer's use of fire. Ethnographic observations point to a dynamic and ephemeral use of hearths. Hearths location were dictated by the social and ever-changing social dynamics of the site. The hearths deposited small amount of residues which were later swept on a daily basis, re-depositing ash and charcoal in waste areas and leaving only a microscopic signal in the original location. Particular acidic conditions and intensive biological activity within tropical sediments result in the complete dissolution of ash and bones while favouring the preservation of charcoal and phytoliths. Consequently, the identification of fire residues in humid tropical forests and the reconstruction of the human use of fire must involve multi-proxy microscopic analysis to detect its micro-signatures."

Title: 'Monitoring forest fires over the Indian region using Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System nighttime satellite data'
Author: 'T.R.'

Abstract: 'AbstractMonitoring and management of forest fires is very important in countries like India where 55% of the total forest cover is prone to fires annually. The present study aims at effective monitoring of forest fires over the Indian region using Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime satellite data and to evaluate the active fire detection capabilities of the sensor. Nightly DMSP-OLS fire products were generated from February to May 2005 (peak fire season) and analyzed to study the occurrence and behavior of fires over different forest physiognomies in Indian region. Fire products generated from DMSP-OLS were validated with ground observations of fire records from state forest departments to evaluate the accuracy of fire products. Further, inter-comparison of the DMSP-OLS derived fire products with contemporary fire products from Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (both daytime and nighttime products) in addition to fires and burnt areas derived from Indian Remote sensing Satellite (IRS-P6) Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) data has been done to analyze spatial agreement of fire locations given by the above sensors.Results from the DMSP-OLS fire products (derived from February to May 2005) over Indian region showed high forest fires in southern dry deciduous forests during February\xe2\x80\x93March; central Indian dry and mixed deciduous forests during March\xe2\x80\x93April; northeastern tropical forests during February\xe2\x80\x93April and northern pine forests during May. Spatial pattern in fires showed a typical seasonal shift in fire activity from the southern dry deciduous forests to the northern pine forests and temperate forests as the fire season progressed. Statistical evaluation of DMSP-OLS fire products with ground observations showed an over all accuracy of 98%. Comparison of DMSP-OLS derived fires with consecutive MODIS and AWiFS derived fires for individual days indicated that 69% of the fires continued from current day (DMSP-OLS pass around \xe2\x88\xbc\xc2\xa07\xc2\xa0pm to \xe2\x88\xbc\xc2\xa010\xc2\xa0pm local time) to the next day (MODIS and AWiFS pass \xe2\x88\xbc\xc2\xa010:30\xc2\xa0am local time). Comparison of DMSP-OLS derived fires with burnt areas estimated from AWiFS showed that 98% of DMSP-OLS derived fires on the current day fell within the burnt area of AWiFS on subsequent day. Since the worst forest fires are those that extend from the current to the consecutive days, DMSP-OLS derived fires provide a valuable augmentation to the fires derived from other sensors operating in daytime.'

Title: 'Original Article/ResearchEcological integrity and environmental protection for Vijayawada region \xe2\x80\x93 Scattered Eastern Ghats'
Author: 'Srikonda'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe ecological integrity is widely discussed as a new concept by several ecologists and environmentalists. A consensus in this regard is yet to be derived for its definition. Human intervention for its developmental activities results in several environmental changes that enhance some species, ecosystem and ecological processes while at the same time brings irrecoverable damage to the Planet Earth. It is essential and crucial to focus research and scientific analysis and establish awareness and education to provide a means of distinguishing responses between improvements in quality of ecosystem and those of damages. The focus of this paper is to emphasize the organized urban planning at a macro level and the architectural design interventions at the micro level in Vijayawada where eco \xe2\x80\x93 sensitivity exists with due consideration to ecological integrity and environmental protection. The ecological dynamics of continuity indicated that hillocks of Vijayawada region are a part of Eastern Ghats. The study is to elaborate that the landscape, eco-patches and its connectivity establishes a unique corridor to strengthen ecological system and as a green corridor to Vijayawada city to fulfill the demands of the city and also to create the ecological patch connectivity to scattered Eastern Ghats especially in the Krishna-Guntur region which connects the Nallamala hills through Kondapalli hill toward Sothern side and to the Papikondalu at the northern side of Eastern Ghats. These corridors may even support environmental conservation and provides rural edge in urban context and functions as lung spaces to ease the heat island effect of urban settlement. So the explicit development controls have been derived to guide and organize at micro level so as to achieve the macro level considerations of ecological integrity.'

Title: 'Fire supported forest utilisation of a degraded dry forest as a means of sustainable local forest management in Tamil Nadu/South India'
Author: 'Joachim'

Abstract: "AbstractWhen scientific forest management was introduced in India under British rule in the second half of the 19th century, it provoked great controversy. Intense discussion surrounded the effect fire had on sustainable forestry. Based upon a 2-year empirical survey in the Kadavakurichi Hillock area of the Dindigul District of Tamil Nadu, this paper revisits that earlier debate. The data show that despite shortcomings in tree growth, areas consisting predominantly of forests largely degraded by frequent fire can satisfy the needs of the local population. The various forms of land use practised in these areas are sustainable at low levels, particularly non-timber forest produce management. Statistical analysis and prognosis indicate that local forest use and management through frequent fire should be able to support this region's livelihood under the prevailing poor environmental conditions as well as into the future. The positive aspects of the traditional fire management regime are discussed against the prevailing paradigm of fire prevention."

Title: 'Impact of selective logging on the dynamics of a low elevation dense moist evergreen forest in the Western Ghats (South India)'

Abstract: 'AbstractWithin the framework of a programme on the functioning of dense moist evergreen forests of the Western Ghats, the French Institute of Pondicherry, in collaboration with the Karnataka Forest Department, installed permanent plots to monitor the dynamics of a low elevation forest. The preliminary results of the comparison of the demographic processes in two compartments are presented: one compartment had never been harvested, while the other was selectively felled in 1979\xe2\x80\x931980. They are compared in terms of species composition, recruitment, mortality and individual growth, in order to describe the natural forest dynamics and evaluate the impact of selective felling. In both compartments, the mortality rate, around 0.9% yr\xe2\x88\x921, is lower than in other tropical moist evergreen forests, while the average diameter increment, at 2.1 (unlogged stand) and 2.9 mm yr\xe2\x88\x921 (logged stand), is higher. The impact of selective felling, 10 to 15 years after the harvest, is mainly noticeable: (i) on mortality of trees with dbh>40 cm belonging to lower canopy and intermediate stratum species which died about four times more in the logged compartment; and (ii) on diameter increment of emergent and upper canopy tree species whose growth is still stimulated by about 50%. Despite the general trend of a reduction in the difference between the density and the basal area of the two compartments, medium-term modification of the demographic processes among the various structural ensembles in the logged compartment, indicates that selective felling may not be sustainable in the long-term without consequences on the forest structure and composition.'

Abstract: 'AbstractStanding crop, rates of production and distribution of very fine (\xe2\x89\xa4 1 mm), fine (> 1 \xe2\x88\x92 \xe2\x89\xa4 3 mm) and coarse (> 3 mm) roots were estimated for one year (August 1993\xe2\x80\x93August 1994) under open and closed canopies of Tropical forest ecosystems at Kodayar in the Western Ghats of India. In the moist deciduous forest very fine root biomass was significantly higher under the open canopies (309 g m\xe2\x88\x922) than in the closed canopies (222 g m\xe2\x88\x922). While in the semi-evergreen and evergreen forest ecosystems closed canopies (Site II: 318, Site III: 315 and Site IV: 275 g m\xe2\x88\x922) were comparatively higher in very fine root biomass than the open canopies (264, 278 and 239 g m\xe2\x88\x922). A similar trend was observed in the fine root productivity also. Under the closed canopies, total fine root standing crop biomass was significantly higher under the evergreen forest (1847\xe2\x80\x932021 g m\xe2\x88\x922) compared with others (1081 g m\xe2\x88\x922 and 1298 g m\xe2\x88\x922). Root production and standing crop biomass showed a seasonal pattern of maximum during the rainy season and minimum in the dry season. Necromass fraction ranged between 52\xe2\x80\x93132 g m\xe2\x88\x922 and the maximum was in the dry period. Localized disturbances such as canopy openings contributed towards the reduction of fine root biomass. Due to the annual wild fire and the consequent grass community dominance in the moist deciduous forest (Site I), greater standing crop of very fine root biomass and net primary productivity was observed. Further, the study revealed that the fine root biomass and production increased significantly due to litter accumulation (P < 0.05) and the soil moisture (P < 0.01) at the ground level. The above results are discussed in the light of understanding the fragility of tropical forests and their management.'

Title: 'Biophysical and anthropogenic controls of forest fires in the Deccan Plateau, India'

Abstract: 'AbstractForest fires constitute one of the most serious environmental problems in several forested regions of India. In the Indian sub-continent, relatively few studies have focused on the assessment of biophysical and anthropogenic controls of forest fires at a landscape scale and the spatial aspects of these relationships. In this study, we used fire count data sets from satellite remote sensing data covering 78 districts over four different states of the Deccan Plateau, India, for assessing the underlying causes of fires. Spatial data for explanatory variables of fires pertaining to topography, vegetation, climate, anthropogenic and accessibility factors have been gathered corresponding with fire presence/absence. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the probability of the presence of fires as a function of the explanatory variables. Results for fire area estimates suggested that, of the total fires covering 47,043km2 that occurred during the year 2000 for the entire Indian region, 29.0% occurred in the Deccan Plateau, with Andhra Pradesh having 13.5%, Karnataka 14.7%, Kerala 0.1%, and Tamilnadu 1.15%. Results from the logistic regression suggest that the strongest influences on the fire occurrences were the amount of forest area, biomass densities, rural population density (PD), average precipitation of the warmest quarter, elevation (ELE) and mean annual temperature (MAT). Among these variables, biomass density (BD) and average precipitation of the warmest quarter had the highest significance, followed by others. These results on the best predictors of forest fires can be used both as a strategic planning tool to address broad scale fire risk concerns, and also as a tactical guide to help forest managers to design fire mitigation measures at the district level.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis study assessed the spatial patterns of significant negative trend of forest seasonal greenness over the different forest types of India using 8-day composite MODIS NDVI (500\xc2\xa0m) time series data (2001\xe2\x80\x932014). It was further analyzed to quantify the negative changes in the core forest areas and to indentify hotspots of it over the large protected forest areas. Significant negative changes in the seasonal greenness were found to be highest over tropical moist deciduous forest (2067.35 thousand ha) followed by tropical dry deciduous (1407.73 thousand ha), tropical wet evergreen (577.43 thousand ha), tropical semi evergreen (442.58 thousand ha), subtropical broad leaved (321.13 thousand ha) and Himalayan moist temperate forest (293.80 thousand ha). Mangroves forest also showed decrease in its greenness over 15.6% of its total area. Interestingly, most of the observed negative changes of high to medium magnitude were found in the core areas of the forest types. Hotspots analysis revealed spatially coherent significant negative changes of seasonal greenness over the large protected areas i.e. Similipal wildlife sanctuary of Odisha, Rajaji national park of Uttarakhand, Achanakmar wildlife sanctuary of Chhattisgarh and Sundarban of West Bengal. The outcomes of the present study would help in the prioritization of the forest types and protected forest areas for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation programmes.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2A review of experimental and observational studies on native tree species beneath pine.\xe2\x80\xa2Pine plantations serve as successional surrogates for native species recruitment and growth.\xe2\x80\xa2Dipterocarp tree species demonstrate high survival and growth beneath pine.\xe2\x80\xa2Forest restoration is a viable economic strategy compared to tea cultivation.AbstractIn the wet forest regions of southwest Sri Lanka and the Western Ghats, India, Pinus caribaea was a common tree species for reforestation on public lands that were originally cleared of native forest for agriculture but subsequently succeeded to fire tolerant grasses and ferns. Much of this reforestation occurred during the 1970s and 1980s. The ecological literature suggests that in many temperate broadleaf forest regions pine is an important component of early succession on old fields, beneath which second growth hardwood can establish and eventually dominate. More recent studies have demonstrated the establishment of native rain forest regeneration beneath a variety of exotic tree plantations. We review nearly twenty-five years of research on this topic for South Asia through a series of studies done in southwest Sri Lanka. Results demonstrate that native species recruitment of both pioneers and site generalist late-successional trees grow well beneath exotic pine plantations. Diversity and density increase from plantation interior to edge. Protection from groundstory fire is the single most important component of promoting regeneration recruitment beneath pine. Establishing late-successional site and dispersal restricted species requires planting beneath pine rather than reliance on natural establishment. Best establishment and growth occur in openings where rows of canopy pine have been removed. Species considered for planting comprise the major late-successional canopy tree species of the forest in the genera Dipterocarpus, Shorea (Dipterocarpaceae) and Mesua (Clusiaceae). Native species that produce non-timber forest products (NTFP) need to be planted with best results in canopy openings. The most valuable NTFP\xe2\x80\x99s comprise a sugar palm (Caryota urens), rattan (Calamus spp.) and a medicinal liana (Coscinium fenestratum). Financial analyses reveal that pine plantations that are enrichment planted and cultivated with rain forest timber and non-timber species can provide superior economic benefits as compared to land cultivated singly for tea.'

But valuation and BCA have also attracted criticisms. \xe2\x80\x98Internal\xe2\x80\x99 criticisms point to the absence of alternative scenarios in valuation, overlooking of ecological trade-offs and dis-services, and inattention to context. Others criticize aggregation across diverse stakeholders and the problem of non-monetizable benefits, and dismiss BCA as fatally flawed. They suggest approaches such as deliberative decision-making and multi-criteria analysis. We propose a middle path that uses the strengths of economic analysis for decision support while avoiding the pitfalls. We disaggregate economic impacts by stakeholder groups, link ecosystem changes to benefits as well as dis-benefits, and examine how socio-technological context shapes the magnitude of economic impact. We illustrate this approach by studying the impact of creating the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple wildlife sanctuary in the Western Ghats forests of southern India. Our analysis shows that while some stakeholders are net beneficiaries, others are net losers. Changes in forest rights, irrigation technologies, and ecosystem dynamics influence the magnitude of benefits and sometimes convert gainers into losers. Such disaggregated analysis can provide useful information for deliberative decision-making and important academic insights on how economic value is generated.'

It also addresses some of the shortcomings identified in existing literature by estimating the value of several intangible benefits, and disservices of forests ignored in most valuation studies, as well as the added value from intact forests as compared to from alternative landscapes. Using primary and secondary data, and economic valuation techniques the study shows that the total net benefits provided by the Nagarhole national park in Karnataka, India are considerable. The added value of benefits from the park is also higher as compared to from alternative landscapes considering just three ecosystem services. If these are factored in decision making it could strengthen the economic case for conserving forests in tropical countries such as India where there is immense pressure to divert forests for meeting development needs.'

Title: 'Foragers, tropical forests and the formation of archaeological evidences: An ethnoarchaeological view from South India'
Author: 'David E.'

Abstract: "AbstractForaging societies present unique ways of livings and sociality which are manifested by distinctive practices and use of space. From an archaeological point of view, understanding forager sociality and studying their practices and the resulted material deposition patterns is crucial to reconstruct archaeological site formation processes. When studying archaeological sites in tropical environments, such as rainforests, one must take into account and study the role of the tropics in the formation of the archaeological record. Human adaptation to tropical environment influences people's practices, use of space and materiality. In addition, the environmental setting plays a significant role in post-depositional processes which may alter, preserve or disrupt archaeological materials. This study involve a long term ethnographic research among a contemporary forager group in South India, which allowed us to associate the social aspects of forager ways of living \xe2\x80\x93 such as mobility, immediacy and adaptation to the tropical forest - with patterns of use of apace and material deposition. Excavations of an abandoned open-air site and a rock-shelter of the same group, included field observations and sediment sampling followed by laboratory analyses which enabled the investigation of post-depositional processes at both the visible and invisible (microscopic and sub-microscopic) scales. Overall, although forager ways of living and the environmental conditions in tropical forests challenge the formation of a well preserved archaeological evidence, an integrated approach examining the different scales of the archaeological record can successfully reconstruct the formation processes of archaeological sites in tropical forests and associate the archaeological evidence with social aspects of forager ways of living."

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Classified spatial data of forest types, historical forest cover and fires were used.\xe2\x80\xa2Ecosystem level analysis has been carried out for all the forest types using multiple threat factors.\xe2\x80\xa2Statistical hotspot analysis and spatial landscape model is used in delineation of the deforestation and degradation hotspots.\xe2\x80\xa2The deforestation and degradation hotspots can be useful in strategic conservation planning.AbstractSpatially explicit planning is required to set focused conservation priorities and assessing future ecological implications. Spatial ecological modeling and hotspot analysis prioritizes the forest ecosystems and supports the conservation of species level biodiversity. In the present study, the hotspots of deforestation and forest fires were obtained using historical deforestation trends (1975\xe2\x80\x931985\xe2\x80\x931995\xe2\x80\x932005\xe2\x80\x932014) and fire history (2009\xe2\x80\x932014) in Andhra Pradesh, India. The priority areas were identified as deforestation and degradation hotspots using combined measures of threat from deforestation, fire hotspots and current level of forest fragmentation. The state of Andhra Pradesh represents an area of 25985\xc2\xa0km2 (16.2% of total geographical area) under forest cover in 2014. The net deforested area was estimated as 2390\xc2\xa0km2 (8.4%) from 1975 to 2014. We have calculated the region of influence in percentages and found deforestation hotspots covering an average of 40.2% forest, followed by 35.9% under high fragmentation and 19.2% under fire hotspots. Ecosystem level analysis has been carried out for all the forest types i.e., semi evergreen, moist deciduous, dry deciduous, dry evergreen, thorn and mangroves, indicating ecosystem vulnerability. According to the results of prioritization, about 10.5% of existing forest had severe ecosystem collapse and categorized as deforestation and degradation hotspot-I. Analysis of protected areas shows Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve, Sri Peninsula Narasimha sanctuary, Papikonda sanctuary and Sri Venkateshwara sanctuary are representing deforestation and degradation hotspot-I. Deforestation and degradation hotspots identified in the study is an excellent surrogate for understanding anthropogenic disturbances and can be effectively useful in forest management to proceed for applicable restoration measures.'

Abstract: "AbstractKnowledge of the social structure of a population is important for a range of fundamental and applied purposes. Group characteristics and population structure of chital (Axis axis) and sambar (Rusa unicolor) were studied in a deciduous habitat of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, Western Ghats, India, during 2008\xe2\x80\x932009. Vehicle transects were monitored monthly to gather information on group\xe2\x80\x93size and age\xe2\x80\x93sex composition of chital and sambar. The average mean group size and crowding for chital and sambar was 13.1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.5 (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01020), 3.6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.2 (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0377) and 33.3, 11.0 respectively. The average adult male:adult female:fawn ratio was 63.4:100:22.3 (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa09391) and 43.9:100:23.7 (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01023) in chital and sambar respectively. The mean group size of chital and sambar varied significantly between seasons (Kruskal\xe2\x80\x93Wallis test, p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0<0.001). Peak fawning season was observed from February to May for chital and May to August for sambar. Group's sex\xe2\x80\x93age composition influenced group formation in both species between seasons at different level. Adult male and fawn were the important predicting variables of change in group size. Skewed female sex ratio was probably due to selective male predation by large predators. Although fawning occurred throughout the year, both species showed seasonality in fawning. The above mentioned patterns differed between species depending upon their ecological adaptation in foraging strategies and habitat preference."

Title: 'National assessment of forest fragmentation in India: Landscape indices as measures of the effects of fragmentation and forest cover change'

Abstract: 'AbstractForest fragmentation is considered as one of the major conservation issue. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the national assessment of spatial patterns of forest fragmentation and influence of deforestation on fragmentation in the Indian forests during three decade interval (1975-2005). Mapping of forest cover was carried out based on Landsat MSS and IRS P6 AWiFS data using hybrid classification techniques on 1:250,000 scale. The present study considered biogeographic zones as a major stratum for national level assessment. The forest fragmentation was analysed based on landscape indices which allow quantification and categorisation of complex forest landscapes and depict landscape composition, structure and scenario of fragmentation. The analysis revealed that in all biogeographic zones, more than 90% of total number of forest fragments consists of patches having area less than 1\xc2\xa0km2. At national level the mean forest patch size stands at 187\xc2\xa0ha. The total core area was highest for Islands (87.4%) followed by Eastern Himalayas (82.5%), Deccan (78.9%), Deserts (76.4%) and Eastern Ghats (76%). The temporal analysis shows that the loss of Indian forest area as 5.8% during 1975\xe2\x80\x932005. The annual rate of deforestation has been computed as 0.20% at national level. The decreased mean patch size, increased edge density and increased number of patches from 1975 to 2005 indicates ongoing fragmentation in biogeographic zones. The very high fragmentation in Trans Himalayas is contributed mostly by the natural factors while in other biogeographic zones, increased fragmentation is due to deforestation.'

Abstract: 'AbstractMonitoring the changes in forest-cover and understanding the dynamics of the forest is becoming increasingly important for the sustainable management of forest ecosystems. This paper uses temporal MODIS Vegetation Continuous Field (MODIS-VCF) to monitor the tree cover change in the Indian region over a period of 6\xc2\xa0years (2000\xe2\x80\x932005). Pixel-based linear regression model is developed to identify rate of deforestation and fragmentation at landscape level. The regression parameters viz., slope, offset and variance are used to identify threshold between forest and non-forest classes. The classification algorithm resulted into change area, no change area, positive change and negative changes. MODIS-VCF raw product of 2005 was validated using the field data and showed a coefficient of determination (R2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.85) between percent tree cover and individual plot wise canopy cover information. The results were overlaid with UNEP protected area boundary. On a long-term basis, the forest cover change was monitored using medium spatial resolution (Landsat and IRS) satellite data to identify the rate of deforestation and fragmentation at landscape level. The developed approach is efficient and effective for regional monitoring of forest cover change. It could be automated for regular usage and monitoring.'

Title: 'Relationship between annual rainfall and tree mortality in a tropical dry forest: Results of a 19-year study at Mudumalai, southern India'

Abstract: 'AbstractVariability in rainfall is known to be a major influence on the dynamics of tropical forests, especially rates and patterns of tree mortality. In tropical dry forests a number of contributing factors to tree mortality, including dry season fire and herbivory by large herbivorous mammals, could be related to rainfall patterns, while loss of water potential in trees during the dry season or a wet season drought could also result in enhanced rates of death. While tree mortality as influenced by severe drought has been examined in tropical wet forests there is insufficient understanding of this process in tropical dry forests. We examined these causal factors in relation to inter-annual differences in rainfall in causing tree mortality within a 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot located in the tropical dry deciduous forests of Mudumalai, southern India, that has been monitored annually since 1988. Over a 19-year period (1988\xe2\x80\x932007) mean annual mortality rate of all stems >1\xc2\xa0cm dbh was 6.9\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa04.6% (range\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01.5\xe2\x80\x9317.5%); mortality rates broadly declined from the smaller to the larger size classes with the rates in stems >30\xc2\xa0cm dbh being among the lowest recorded in tropical forest globally. Fire was the main agent of mortality in stems 1\xe2\x80\x935\xc2\xa0cm dbh, elephant-herbivory in stems 5\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0cm dbh, and other natural causes in stems >10\xc2\xa0cm dbh. Elephant-related mortality did not show any relationship to rainfall. On the other hand, fire-related mortality was significantly negatively correlated to quantity of rainfall during the preceding year. Mortality due to other causes in the larger stem sizes was significantly negatively correlated to rainfall with a 2\xe2\x80\x933-year lag, suggesting that water deficit from mild or prolonged drought enhanced the risk of death but only with a time lag that was greater than similar lags in tree mortality observed in other forest types. In this respect, tropical dry forests growing in regions of high rainfall variability may have evolved greater resistance to rainfall deficit as compared to tropical moist or temperate forests but are still vulnerable to drought-related mortality.'

This region comprises of eight countries: India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Maldives. In South Asia, agricultural land is predominant constituting 43% of the total geographical area followed by barren land (19.99%) and forests (14.72%). The long-term change analysis using the classified maps of 1930 and 2014 indicated a loss of 29.62% of the forest cover. Higher annual net deforestation rates were observed in the period from 1930\xe2\x80\x931975 (0.68%) followed by 1975\xe2\x80\x931985 (0.23%), 1985\xe2\x80\x931995 (0.12%), 1995\xe2\x80\x932005 (0.06%) and 2005\xe2\x80\x932014 (0.04%) for the region. Forest fragmentation had significant spatio-temporal variation across the South Asian countries. In 1930, 88.91% of the South Asian forest was classified as large core forest, 8.18% as edge forest and 1.18% as perforated forest. The large core forest category has decreased significantly in area over last eight decades. The results of the present study are expected to serve as a reference for the evaluation of globally agreed Aichi biodiversity target 5 for South Asian countries. This study will be a valuable basis for developing management strategies and restoration programs as it tracks the spatial changes in deforestation and forest fragmentation."

Title: 'Biomass, litterfall and aboveground net primary productivity of herbaceous communities in varied ecosystems at Kodayar in the western ghats of Tamil Nadu'

Abstract: 'AbstractInfluence of herbaceous weed community on the forest ecosystem structure and function are essential to manage or control weeds effectively. Therefore, an attempt was made to study biomass, litter production and aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) of herbaceous community was studied in natural secondary forest and man-modified ecosystems such as rubber plantation, Albizia plantation and wasteland. Man-modified ecosystems showed significantly greater herb density than the natural ecosystem. This may be due to open habitat in the man-modified ecosystems, which favoured colonisation of exotic weed species resulting in greater herb density. All the landuses studied here showed greater standing crop biomass in the tree layer compared to herbaceous layer. However, herbaceous layer aboveground biomass and net primary production varied among the landuse types considerably. Greater biomass of annual exotic weeds and Lantana camara in these man-modified ecosystem could be attributed to high degree of disturbance and open environment. Greater standing crop biomass and net primary productivity of Chromolaena odorata in rubber plantation may be due to the existing practice of ineffective aboveground mechanical weeding. Lower ANPP and greater biomass accumulation quotient of exotics such as C. odorata and L. camara in the natural secondary forest may be attributed to less favourable resource conditions for its growth and also possibly lack of occurrence of disturbance. Percentage contribution of exotic plants to the total herbaceous community in terms of litter production and ANPP was higher in the wasteland and lower in the disturbed forest. But, the native plants contribution showed a reverse trend. Percentage contribution of exotic plants to the total herbaceous community in terms of litter production and ANPP was higher in the wasteland and lower in the disturbed forest. But, the native plants contribution showed a reverse trend. Greater herbaceous community litter production and net primary productivity in the man-modified ecosystems might be due to faster turnover of ruderal herbaceous community or modification of the tree layer.'

Title: 'Threat evaluation for biodiversity conservation of forest ecosystems using geospatial techniques: A case study of Odisha, India'
Author: 'C. Sudhakar'

Abstract: 'AbstractUp-scaling the evaluation of threat status of biodiversity from species to ecosystem level has remained for long a research challenge in global conservation science. To meet this challenge, the present study makes an attempt toward actionable conservation prescription and assigning a threat category scheme for forest ecosystems. The scheme sets the quantitative criteria for evaluation of cumulative anthropogenic threats in grid cells, such as deforestation, degradation, fragmentation, forest fires and biological invasions. Adopting the convention of IUCN, five conservation status categories (i.e. Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable, Near Threatened, Least Concern) have been similarly adopted for the forest ecosystems facing these threats. The operational success of this scheme of threat categories at ecosystem level has been strengthened by remote sensing and field data generated for the forest ecosystems of Odisha, India. The threat category status of the forest ecosystems were identified by creating grids (5\xc2\xa0km\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0km) in GIS and assigned the degree of the threats for each grid. The database on deforestation was generated using topographical maps of 1935 and remote sensing data of 1975 and 2010. The degradation in forest ecosystems have been assessed based on the change in forest canopy closure, fragmentation pattern, forest fire distribution and impact of biological invasions. The analysis for conservation priority hotspots complements an assessment of the threatened ecosystems undergoing remarkable level of multiple threats. Areas under the danger of cumulative anthropogenic threats would have a higher priority. 5.8% grids of existing forest had included under the category of conservation priority hotspot-I, followed by 12.4% in conservation priority hotspot-II, and 12.5% in conservation priority hotspot-III. An integrated approach involving the cumulative anthropogenic threat indicators have been found to be the most appropriate tool to empirically evaluate the threat status of the forest ecosystems. Finally, identification of ecosystems especially those facing increasing extinction risks, as attempted in the present study, can help in devising an appropriate policy and management agenda for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'AbstractMost of the world\xe2\x80\x99s remaining terrestrial biodiversity exists in tropical ecosystems affected by human activities. Despite the threats to seasonally dry tropical ecosystems, little is known about the impact of human land use change on their conservation value. We used savanna woodlands within the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot as a case study to understand the effects of human land use on plant diversity. We investigated the effects of three common land-use activities \xe2\x80\x93 biomass extraction, livestock grazing and ground fire \xe2\x80\x93 on species richness and diversity, as well as species composition in terms of the breadth of geographic ranges of species present. We found that total species richness increased with livestock grazing due to increased understory richness. Overstory diversity and tree sapling diversity and richness decreased with more recent fire. Greater canopy openness was associated with increased understory richness and reduced overstory richness. The combination of fire and livestock grazing are likely to increase canopy openness, leading to a shift in diversity from the overstory to the understory. Although we found no change in species richness or diversity with biomass extraction, areas with biomass extraction had more widely distributed species and fewer narrowly distributed species, indicating land use may lead to biotic homogenization. Our results suggest that a mosaic of protected areas along with areas managed for biomass extraction and livestock grazing would be an effective way to balance the conservation of plant diversity with local communities\xe2\x80\x99 needs while maintaining overall levels of plant species diversity in these savanna woodlands.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba We assessed the effects of moderate land use on savanna woodlands in South India. \xe2\x96\xba Moderate land use maintained overall plant diversity and species richness. \xe2\x96\xba Fire and livestock grazing shifted diversity from the overstory to the understory. \xe2\x96\xba Areas with biomass extraction had more common and fewer rare species. \xe2\x96\xba A mosaic of land uses could balance local needs with biodiversity conservation.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper analyses the economics of biodiversity conservation in the context of a tropical forest ecosystem in the Western Ghats region of India, where coffee is the main competitor for land use. Using primary data covering a cross-section of coffee growers, the study notes that the opportunity costs of biodiversity conservation in terms of coffee benefits foregone are quite high. Even after including external costs due to wildlife damages and defensive expenditure to protect against wildlife, the NPVs and IRRs from coffee for all land holding groups were high. Including external costs, these NPVs across different land holding groups ranged between Rs 17 thousand to over Rs 106 thousand per acre at 12% discount rate, and the IRRs between 16.6% and 23%. Even if the expected benefits were to decrease by 20% and costs rise by a similar proportion, still the IRRs from coffee were quite high (19.5\xe2\x80\x9320.1%). The study notes that the external costs accounted for between 7% and 15% of the total discounted costs of coffee cultivation, and smaller holdings proportionately incurred higher external costs as compared to large holdings. The study also notes high transaction costs incurred by the growers to claim compensation for wildlife damages. Notwithstanding these disincentives, the study notes that the local community had a positive attitude towards biodiversity conservation and were willing to pay in terms of spending time for participatory biodiversity conservation. Taking elephants, a keystone and threatened species in Asia and the study region, for the contingent valuation survey, the study notes that the respondents are willing to spend 25.8 humandays per household annually which works to over Rs 6003 per household per annum in terms of the income foregone. They also preferred a decentralized government institution for participatory biodiversity conservation.'

Abstract: 'AbstractForests and grassy vegetation (savannas and grasslands) are alternative ecosystem states in many tropical landscapes. Relative to forests the grassy ecosystems are poorly known and poorly conserved, partly because they were thought to be products of forest clearance. However many grasslands have proved to be ancient. Commensurate with their antiquity, grassy biomes have distinct suites of plant and animal species that contribute a large fraction of the diversity of forest\xe2\x80\x93grassland mosaics. Grasslands differ strikingly from forests in their ecology and in the nature of threats to their future. Here we highlight the high biodiversity value of grassy biomes and, in contrast to tropical forests, we illustrate the importance of fire in maintaining these systems. We discuss the major threats to, and consequences for, biodiversity in these regions including land clearance and elevated CO2-driven forest expansion. Finally we focus on the difficulties of grassland restoration. A new approach to understanding and conserving grassy ecosystems, free from cultural prejudices of the past, is long overdue.'

Title: 'Overcoming ecological barriers to tropical lower montane forest succession on anthropogenic grasslands: Synthesis and future prospects'
Author: 'A.M.T.A.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112714001893
Abstract: 'AbstractUnderstanding the ecological mechanisms that constrain forest succession in tropical degraded anthropogenic grasslands is a prerequisite for the design of techniques for restoring biodiversity and ecosystem processes. In this context, succession on post-agricultural lands may be arrested by a variety of site-specific biotic and abiotic factors. Here we synthesise our research on the effects of five biotic factors (seed dispersal, development of a soil seed bank, seedling emergence, herbivory, competition) and five abiotic factors (fire, microclimatic conditions, soil nutrients, water availability, disturbance) as constraints to forest succession on degraded anthropogenic grasslands in a tropical lower montane forest landscape in Sri Lanka. The aim of this research was to deduce ecologically and socially acceptable restoration techniques to accelerate forest recovery. Colonisation of grasslands by trees is constrained by limited seed dispersal from adjacent remnant forest patches and their incorporation into grassland soil seed banks. For the few tree seeds that are dispersed into grasslands, a combination of vertebrate herbivory and annual dry season fires reduces the likelihood that they emerge as seedlings. Removal of the grass canopy by clipping or tilling increases the emergence of woody plant seedlings close to the boundaries of forest patches, but has no effect beyond 20\xc2\xa0m into the established grassland. Our research shows that isolation of seedling root systems from those of competing grasses increases the growth and survival of tree seedlings transplanted directly into grassland swards, while above-ground competition and exclusion of vertebrate herbivores has no effects on seedling growth and survival. These experiments identified that the early-successional species Macaranga indica Wight and Symplocos cochinchinensis (Lour.) S. Moore are potential candidates for use in reforestation programmes on abandoned grasslands. We propose a strategy for a model forest restoration programme based on the creation of vegetation islands using early-successional native tree species, the application of a tilling treatment around remnant forest patches, creation of fire breaks around vegetation islands, and the protection of isolated individual trees and tree patches within established grasslands. We highlight the importance of further research on the ecology and biology of seed dispersers and seed predators, and expansion of knowledge on the regeneration traits of native tree species, for future refinements of this restoration strategy.'

Abstract: 'AbstractA total of 39 soil surface samples collected between 11\xc2\xb030\xe2\x80\xb2N 76\xc2\xb045\xe2\x80\xb2E and 12\xc2\xb045\xe2\x80\xb2N 78\xc2\xb015\xe2\x80\xb2E from the mainly deciduous forests in the Biligirirangan\xe2\x80\x93Melagiri hills of the southern Eastern Ghats were analysed for their pollen content. The samples are distributed among four different deciduous and evergreen vegetation types between 210 and 1700\xc2\xa0m altitudes and fall within three distinct rainfall regimes. The aims of this paper are to provide new data on the modern pollen rain from the Southern Eastern Ghats, a region characterized by a unique and complex climate and vegetation, and to interpret these data using multivariate statistics and the diagram of pollen percentages. We could distinguish first between the deciduous and the evergreen forests and then also between different types of deciduous forest. The distinction between the evergreen and deciduous forests was based on a humidity gradient and that among the deciduous forests on a physiognomic gradient identified through correspondence analysis. The above analysis also allowed us to identify a set of 14 pollen taxa markers and 11 associated pollen taxa that help differentiate the evergreen from deciduous forests. Similarly, a set of 12 pollen taxa markers and six associated pollen taxa was demarcated to help distinguish woodland formations from scrub and thicket formations, among the deciduous vegetation. We could also differentiate amongst the four distinct vegetation types sampled, on the basis of distinct associations of both tree and herb pollen taxa according to their relative abundance in the pollen diagram as well as on the proportion of total arboreal pollen. The ground cover of grasses and other herbaceous plants in the deciduous forests is effectively demonstrated by percentages of non-arboreal pollen varying between 40 and 70%. The 1000\xc2\xa0m altitude limit reflecting a gradient of humidity and the physiognomic gradient among deciduous forests seem to be important in this region.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe fate of much of the world\xe2\x80\x99s terrestrial biodiversity is linked to the management of human-modified forest landscapes in the humid tropics. This Special Issue presents the first pan-tropical synthesis of research on the prospects for biodiversity in such systems, with eight individual regional summaries covering Mesoamerica, Amazonia, Atlantic forest of South America, West Africa, Madagascar, Western Ghats, Southeast Asia and Oceania. Two additional papers compare the state of conservation science in tropical forests with both temperate forests and savannah systems. This overview paper provides a comparative analysis of the threats and opportunities facing tropical forest biodiversity, thereby helping to identify the most pressing areas of future research and region-specific factors that contribute towards the effectiveness of individual conservation initiatives. While many of the threats facing tropical forest biodiversity are commonplace they vary markedly in their relative importance across different regions. There is a critical lack of comparable data to understand scale dependent processes, or the relative importance of varying geographic and historical contexts in determining present-day patterns. Conservation science has a key role to play in safeguarding the future of tropical forest biodiversity, but needs to become more effectively embedded in the context of real-world conservation challenges and opportunities. Significant progress can be achieved by improving the cost-effectiveness of research as well as the exchange of ideas and data amongst scientists working in different, often isolated parts of the world. We hope this special issue goes some way top achieving this exchange of knowledge.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We retrospectively studied unmanaged forest recovery facing silvicultural cessation.\xe2\x80\xa2Cessation resulted in high overstory and shrub density but structurally homogenized.\xe2\x80\xa2Overstory related to edaphic factors and overstory is a stronger driver of understory species distribution.\xe2\x80\xa2Soil mineralogy can reinforce nutrient supply for moderate-level harvesting to harmonize multifunctionality sustainably.AbstractForests with intensive management past are kept unmanaged to restore diversity and ecosystem functioning. Before perpetuating abandonment after protracted restitution, understanding its effect on forest vegetation is desirable. We studied plant diversity and its relation with environmental variables and stand structure in northern Indian unmanaged tropical moist deciduous forest. We hypothesized that post-abandonment species richness would have increased, and the structure of contemporary forest would be heterogeneous. Vegetation structure, composition, and diversity were recorded, in forty 0.1\xc2\xa0ha plots selected randomly in four forest ranges. Three soil samples per 0.1\xc2\xa0ha were assessed for physicochemistry, fine sand, and clay mineralogy. Contemporary forest had less species richness than pre-abandonment reference period. Fourteen species were recorded as either seedling or sapling, suggesting reappearance or immigration. For most species, regeneration was either absent or impaired. Ordination and multiple regression results showed that exchangeable base cations and phosphorous affected maximum tree diversity and structure variables. Significant correlations between soil moisture and temperature, and shrub layer was observed, besides tree layer correspondence with shrub richness, suggesting that dense overstory resulting from abandonment through its effect on soil conditions, is responsible for dense shrub layer. Herb layer diversity was negatively associated with tree layer and shrub overgrowth (i.e. Mallotus spp.). Protracted abandonment may not reinforce species richness and heterogeneity; perhaps result in high tree and shrub density in moist deciduous forests, which can impede immigrating or reappearing plant species establishment. This can be overcome by density/basal area reduction strategies, albeit for both tree and shrub layer.'

Abstract: 'AbstractA case study is presented on the impact of an extensive grassland fire, at a high altitude location in Western Ghats, on the aerosol black carbon (BC) mass concentration (MB) and concentration (CO) of carbon monoxide measured at two remote, coastal, nearby locations. Observations revealed a substantial increase shortly after the outbreak of the fire at a high altitude location (\xe2\x88\xbc\xc2\xa020\xc2\xa0km away) in the concentrations of both species; while a two-fold increase occurred in the mass concentration of BC; the increase in CO though was less pronounced (by a factor of \xe2\x88\xbc\xc2\xa01.5). It is suggested that the sea-breeze circulation modified by the prevailing winds caused the transport of pollutants from the source region downwind to the coastal location. The impact persisted for one day after which it became insignificant. During the first maximum of these, the wind conditions were such that the pollutants emitted from the fire were transported offshore with the return flow of the sea breeze, they then sank along with the airmass and were again transported back to the coast via the sea breeze. During the second maximum (after sunset), the particles as well as the trace gases along with the airmass came directly to the regions of fire to the valley via katabatic flow and were again transported to the coast via the land breeze. This added with the nighttime confinement of pollutants near the surface caused the enhancement in nocturnal peak and it prevailed high until next day morning unlike normal days.'

Abstract: 'AbstractLack of knowledge on forest structure, composition, and magnitude of human impact on various components of the ecosystem remain a major limitation for the development of appropriate participatory management programmes for conservation and sustainable utilisation of forests in Nepal. This study provides information on state of the resource base and effects of site characteristics and human activities on density, diversity and regeneration in Sal (Shorea robusta Gaertn.f.) and Mixed Broadleaved (MBL) forests in the central, lower Mid-Hills of Nepal. For trees with diameter \xe2\xa9\xbe10\xc2\xa0cm the results are based on 72 square (20\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa020\xc2\xa0m) plots; for shrubs and herbs the material included 144 plots, nested within the 72 larger plots. Apart from vegetation data the material included information on human impacts, such as tree cutting, livestock grazing and lopping. The proportion of trees felled in Sal forest was observed to be up to 41%. The pressure on the vegetation also affected the regeneration of trees, shrubs and herbs. The density and basal area were moderate for all vegetation types, whereas the species diversity was higher than previously observed in other forests of Nepal. Among the species used by the ethnic group living in the study area, the Chepangs, only half (49.7%) were represented within the plots and the regeneration of such species was poor. Effects of altitude, aspect, grazing, crown cover and other factors on basal area and density of different vegetation strata was examined using general linear models. The results indicated significant human impact on the forest vegetation, both with respect to species diversity, density, distribution, and composition. Reduction of the densities of key livelihood species will affect the social and economic welfare of local people. Thus an improvement of forest management is urgent, because the forests need immediate recovery.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Density, diversity, frequency, basal area, coverage and utilisation effects were studied in two types of forests. \xe2\x96\xba Indicated significant human impact on species diversity, density, distribution, composition and regeneration. \xe2\x96\xba Reduction of the densities of key livelihood species affects the social and economic welfare of local people.'

The archaeological stratigraphy of the site has been sealed by several mud-brick wall collapses, preserving an interesting sequence of living floors, whose micromorphological study is unique for the Central Sahara. This investigation together with the mineralogical analysis of sediments, confirms the field attribution of archaeological features as domestic fireplaces, and identified the living floors as areas devoted to animal penning, probably subjected to periodical firing. The investigation also highlights an exceptional concentration of gypsum pedofeatures, presumably determined by the wood type selected for fuel. The archaeobotanical study identified a good quantity of charcoal and other plant remains in the same layers. Most of the charcoal has been identified as Central Tamarix, which is the most common tree living in the oasis today. This suggests that tamarisk wood was the most exploited tree for fuel, and its combustion led to the dispersion of gypsum from the plant tissue, later recrystallized in the shape of microcrystalline nodules, lenses, and euhedral crystals.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (532KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractEthnopharmacological relevanceTraditional medicine remained as the most affordable and easily accessible source of treatment for many ailments. The Malayali tribes living in the Kolli hills region of Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu has long history of ethnomedicinal knowledge has been remained unexplored hither to. Hence, this study was initiated with an aim to record the ethnomedicinal plants of Malayali tribes and to document and analyse the local knowledge on phytotherapy before environmental and cultural changes deplete the resources.MethodsIn order to document the phytotherapical knowledge, a field study was carried out between August 2012 and February 2014. The ethnomedicinal knowledge was recorded through interviews among the Malayali tribes, and traditional healers. In addition a semi structure questionnaire was used to collect information on the local name of the plant, plant part used for curing, method of preparation in phytoremedies and any other plants/agents used as ingredients. Factor of informant consensus (Fic), use value (UV), fidelity level (FL), relative importance (RI) and novelty index were employed in data analysis.ResultsCurrent research work reports total of 86 medicinal plant species belonging to 76 genera of 46 different families. Herbs constituted the largest growth habit (48 species, 56%) followed by trees (13 species, 15%) and shrubs (9 species, 11%) etc. Leaf 43 (46%) is the plant part widely used followed by whole plant 9 (10%), seeds and fruits 9 (10%) and root 7 (8%). Paste was the most common preparation method use in herbal recipes. These plants were used to treat various human diseases and ailments grouped under 19 disease categories with the highest number of species (31) being used for dermatological infections/diseases followed by gastro-intestinal ailments (28) and general health (15). Asystasia chelonoides (UV of 2.76) and Piper nigrum (UV of 2.12) are the most frequently and popularly used medicinal plant species in the study area.ConclusionThe result of the study revealed that there was high diversity of medicinal plants and traditional knowledge about the use, preparation, and application of which is still maintained in the study area. However, the knowledge of herbal medicine was held by elders. The decline in the use of plants by the younger generation may gradually lead to the fading away of indigenous knowledge associated with the plants.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (213KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Contribution of forest fire ash and plant litter decay on stream dissolved composition in a sub-humid tropical watershed (Mule Hole, Southern India)'
Author: 'St\xc3\xa9phane'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254114000989
Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We study the effect of fire-derived plant ash leaching and plant litter decay on elemental export from a tropical watershed.\xe2\x80\xa2We combine laboratory physico-chemical experiments, end-member mixing analysis and watershed geochemical monitoring.\xe2\x80\xa2We provide elemental dissolution rates at steady-state quantified from mixed-flow experiments.\xe2\x80\xa2Dissolution rates can be implemented in modelling of chemical weathering and major species cycling at the watershed scale.\xe2\x80\xa2Wildfire increases the mobility and export of major elements, particularly within the short-term (daily to monthly) range.AbstractThe current understanding of wildfire effects on water chemistry is limited by the quantification of the elemental dissolution rates from ash and element release rate from the plant litter, as well as quantification of the specific ash contribution to stream water chemistry. The main objective of the study was to provide such knowledge through combination of experimental modelling, field data and end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) of wildfire impact on a watershed scale. The study concerns watershed effects of fire in the Indian subcontinent, a region that is typically not well represented in the fire science literature. In plant litter ash, major elements are either hosted in readily-soluble phases (K, Mg) such as salts, carbonates and oxides or in less-soluble carrier-phases (Si, Ca) such as amorphous silica, quartz and calcite. Accordingly, elemental release rates, inferred from ash leaching experiments in batch reactor, indicated that the element release into solution followed the order K\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0Na\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0Si\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0Ca. Experiments on plant litter leaching in mixed-flow reactor indicated two dissolution regimes: rapid, over the week and slower over the month. The mean dissolution rates at steady-state (Rss) indicated that the release of major elements from plant litter followed the order Ca\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0Si\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0Cl\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0K\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0Na. Rss for Si and Ca for tree leaves and herbaceous species are similar to those reported for boreal and European tree species and are higher than that from the dissolution of soil clay minerals. This identifies tropical plant litters as important source of Si and Ca for tropical surface waters. In the wildfire-impacted year 2004, the EMMA indicated that the streamflow composition (Ca, K, Mg, Na, Si, Cl) was controlled by four main sources: rainwater, throughfall, ash leaching and soil solution. The influence of the ash end-member was maximal early in the rainy season (the two first storm events) and decreased later in the rainy season, when the stream was dominated by the throughfall end-member. The contribution of plant litter decay to the streamwater composition for a year not impacted by wildfire is significant with estimated solute fluxes originating from this decay greatly exceed, for most major elements, the annual elemental dissolved fluxes at the Mule Hole watershed outlet. This highlighted the importance of solute retention and vegetation back uptake processes within the soil profile. Overall, the fire increased the mobility and export of major elements from the soils to the stream. It also shifted the vegetation-related contribution to the elemental fluxes at the watershed outlet from long-term (seasonal) to short-term (daily to monthly).'

Title: 'ReviewForest dynamics after selective timber harvesting in Papua New Guinea'
Author: 'Cossey K.'

Abstract: 'AbstractForest dynamics after timber harvesting is a major issue for tropical forest managers and communities. Timber harvesting provides income to communities and governments and resources to industry but it has also been identified as a potential contributor to deforestation and degradation of tropical forests. In Papua New Guinea (PNG) harvesting is primarily occurring in accessible primary forests however, the fate of these forests under current harvesting practices is poorly understood.In this study we investigated the impacts of selective harvesting on stand structure, growth and dynamics, recovery and degradation, and species diversity. We also assessed the impacts of forest fire after the 1997\xe2\x80\x9398 El Nino on basal area (BA) growth and mortality rates of natural tropical forests in PNG. For this study we used data from 118 (105 in selectively harvested and 13 in un-harvested forest), one-hectare permanent sample plots distributed across the country and measured for over 15\xc2\xa0years by the PNG Forest Research Institute (PNGFRI). We analysed data from 84 of these plots in harvested forest to examine temporal trends in stand condition following harvesting. Mortality rates were investigated in 10 of the 21 plots in harvested forest that were burned during the 1997\xe2\x80\x9398 El Nino drought with sufficient data for analyses. We tested a model developed in Queensland tropical forests to determine whether or not a critical threshold residual BA existed for the recovery of harvested tropical forests in PNG. Results from a logarithmic regression analysis of the relationship between starting BA (BA at first census) and stand BA increment after selective harvesting showed a positive increase in BA growth (r2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.74, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). However, there was no critical threshold in residual BA that determined whether a harvested forest was likely to degrade or recover BA growth after harvesting. Our analyses suggested that the response to harvesting was variable, with the majority of un-burned plots (75%) showing an increase in BA and remainder a decrease. Average BA of selectively-harvested tropical forests was about 17\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa04.17 (SD). Average annual increment in BA across the 84 un-burned plots was 0.17\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.62 (SD). Thus these forests generally show capacity to recover after selective harvesting even when the residual BA is low. A proportion of the BA increment is made up of non-commercial pioneer species that originate in significant gaps after harvesting. On burned plots, BA is affected by high mortality rates. The fate of these forests will depend on the degree of future harvesting, potential conversion to agriculture and the impact of fire and other disturbances.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Basal area and timber volume are generally increasing after harvesting. \xe2\x96\xba El Nino forest fires affected BA growth and mortality was high on 10% of plots. \xe2\x96\xba Assisted regeneration will assist recovery in sites with declining BA. \xe2\x96\xba Smaller-scale harvesting is required for management of harvested forests in PNG.'

Title: "Urbanization, the energy ladder and forest transitions in India's emerging economy"
Author: 'R.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837709000738
Abstract: 'AbstractUrbanization is currently a major force in tropical land use transitions as economic activities aggregate in urban centers, particularly in Asia. This paper examines relationships among urbanization, household energy source, and forest cover at the state level in India using available census, survey, and remote sensing analysis from the 1990s and 2000s. Central questions include (1) how rapidly are urban and rural households switching from traditional to modern fuel sources; and (2) what are the consequences of changing household energy sources for fuelwood demand and forest cover. Country-wide, 30 and 78% of urban and rural households respectively used fuelwood for cooking in 1993. In urban households, the percentage decreased to 22% by 2005 with a shift towards liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The shift occurred across almost all income classes. In rural areas, the use of LPG increased fourfold but 75% of households still rely on fuelwood. Despite the decline in percentage households using traditional fuels, fuelwood demand continued to increase from 1993 to 2005 at a national scale due to an increasing total number of households. However, 25% of states and union territories experienced declines in rural fuelwood demand and over 70% declines in urban fuelwood demand. Forest cover has remained steady or increased slightly over the time period, reaffirming the conclusion that fuelwood demand may lead to local degradation but not large-scale deforestation. At the state level, increases in percent forest cover between 2000 and 2004 are positively associated with percent of total households that are urban (corresponding to fewer percentage households using wood) but not related to changes in fuelwood demand. Plantations are a primary cause of increases in forest area, where benefits to ecosystem services such as biodiversity and hydrologic function are controversial. Results suggest that households will continue to climb the energy ladder with future urbanization, resulting in substantial development benefits and reduced exposure to indoor air pollution. Implications of reduced fuelwood demand for forest cover are less certain but the limited data suggest that urbanization will promote a transition to increasing forest cover in the Indian context.'

Abstract: 'AbstractUnderstanding carbon stocks relative to tree species is important for managing tropical forests in a way that will result in the carbon emission reductions and biodiversity conservation required under the REDD+\xc2\xa0scheme. Here we analyse inventory data from 179 sample plots in semi-evergreen forests of three provinces in Cambodia. Across all study sites, 5,995 trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) \xe2\x89\xa510\xc2\xa0cm, comprising 79 species from 38 families, were analysed. Tree species of the Dipterocarpaceae were most common (10 species), followed by the species of Caesalpinaceae, Combretaceae and Ebenaceae. Analysis of relative carbon stocks (RCS) suggested that Lagerstroemia calyculata Kurz (RCS=14.3%), Syzygium sp. (6.8%), Shorea vulgaris (5.0%), Irvingia malayana (4.8%), Anisoptera costata Kort (4.6%), Vatica astrotricha (4.2%), and Dehaasia cuneata Blume (3.8%) together accounted for 43.6% of the total average carbon stocks of 99.8\xc2\xb14.8\xc2\xa0MgC\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. We found that carbon stock is highly correlated to basal area (R2=0.993) but not to stem density (R2=0.153). Using carbon stock values, we estimated the carbon emission due to deforestation of semi-evergreen forests to be 8.3\xc2\xa0TgCO2 \xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 in Cambodia between 2002 and 2010. These emissions and the loss of 79 tree species in our study sites could be avoided if financial incentives were available for protecting semi-evergreen forests in Cambodia.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe spread of the exotic shrub Scotch broom in the montane grasslands of the Nilgiris is one of the major threats to biodiversity and ecosystem function there. It is likely that fire suppression over the past few decades is the proximate cause of expansion of broom populations. This study capitalizes on a wildfire event to examine fire effects on mature broom populations and soil seedbanks. Fire resulted in widespread death of mature broom stands but also stimulated broom soil seedbanks. However, this initial difference in seedling densities in burned and unburned plots was lost over time due to continuous recruitment in unburned plots. In a seed addition experiment, plots which were clipped prior to the fire showed higher germination success, possibly because fire temperature was moderated by biomass removal. In another experiment, non-dormant broom seeds were added to burned plots, which then received clipping treatments; there were no differences in broom seedling survival in clipped vs. unclipped plots. Overall, these results suggest that prescribed burning might contribute to the control of Scotch broom invasion by helping eliminate mature stands without significantly increasing regeneration from seed.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba We studied fire effects on an invasive shrub, Scotch broom, in a montane grassland. \xe2\x96\xba Fire killed mature broom stands and stimulated broom soil seedbanks. \xe2\x96\xba But over time, seedling densities did not differ between burned and unburned areas. \xe2\x96\xba Our results suggest that prescribed burning might help control broom invasion.'

Title: 'Joint forest management in India: Experiences of two decades'
Author: 'Prodyut'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344909002274
Abstract: "AbstractJoint Forest Management (JFM), embracing the philosophy of forest conservation and livelihood improvement through cooperation between state and civil society, has emerged over the past decades both as a specific paradigm of forest governance in India and as India's largest community forestry program. The JFM program, evolved during early 1970s covering a few forest villages as a model for reversing the trend of degraded forest ecosystem through the active protection by local villagers. The JFM program is implemented currently by 106,482 Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMC) and it covers 22 million ha of forests spread across 28 constituent states of India and union territories.JFM emerged against a backdrop of two centuries of centralised bureaucratic control over forest management in India. Centralized control during the 19th and 20th centuries failed either to conserve resources or to contribute substantially to the well-being of local populations. However, inconsistent persuasions from decentralization policies in India under present forest policy (1988) have prompted people to analyse the theoretical basis for accepting that decentralization would bring improvements in forest ecosystem management. Still others have contested the de facto rationale for decentralization (i.e., improved forest management) and have suggested that decentralization may be a manipulation by elites to serve their own interests or to shift power, for example from national to international agencies that have funded decentralization. Thirty years from its inception, there are now concerns for the recent effectiveness of JFM (over the past 20 years) because it is a group action that is getting old and is perhaps losing some of its pioneering drive and innovativeness.Although JFM has been administered nationally, decisions on implementation detail have been left to the individual states, resulting in different strategies. The long history of JFM has also provided scope for experiences with it to change over time as well as between places.Given the range of experiences with and perceptions of JFM, as well as the importance of the objectives JFM ostensibly serves, the time is ripe therefore for a retrospective evaluation to take stock of its actual achievements, its status and ways forward. The current paper seeks to provide such a review and analysis.The paper highlights design and implementation issues related to government resolutions, benefits-sharing and forest offences. It also assesses the critical design factors and key drivers responsible for institutional reforms. The paper evaluates impacts of protection on forest productivity and on the livelihoods of local communities. It highlights that the JFM program, by virtue of the diversity of its implementation, provides an ideal laboratory for exploring why similar reforms can lead to different outcomes. The paper argued that though there are supporting government policy and guideline and massive fund support, why there has been a low down of enthusiasm for JFM in the last two decades. From experiences, it suggests strategies for its revival and JFM can further contribute effective toward forest conservation and enhanced livelihood opportunities in the future."

Title: 'Can local use assist in controlling invasive alien species in tropical forests? The case of Lantana camara in southern India'
Author: 'Ramesh'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We considered the use of the invasive Lantana camara as an opportunity for control.\xe2\x80\xa2Forest inventory showed reduced density of Lantana plants in harvested sites.\xe2\x80\xa2Season of cutting and stem cut influenced the extent of regrowth and mortality.\xe2\x80\xa2Harvesting may check Lantana at the local scale, but not at a landscape scale.AbstractMany invasive alien species (IAS) are used by local communities for a variety of subsistence and income generating purposes. This frequently poses a conflict of interest for their removal due to forest conservation and biodiversity concerns. However, if local use can simultaneously check or control specific IAS, the conflict can be avoided and both development and forest conservation perspectives accommodated in the short to medium term. We examine this for Lantana camara invasion in southern India through assessment of the demand for and impacts of harvesting on this globally problematic IAS. We interviewed local artisans regarding their knowledge and quantities of Lantana used, along with forest surveys to estimate Lantana densities and size classes in harvested and unharvested sites, and lastly we undertook controlled cutting in moist and dry deciduous forests in both the wet and dry seasons to examine rate of regrowth and mortality. Over the entire study area the abundance of Lantana far outweighed local demand, but at small scales around villages, density and size classes were significantly reduced through harvesting. The controlled cutting experiment showed marked seasonal differences, with the most severe cutting intensity resulting in significant mortality when Lantana plants were cut in the wet season, but with limited effect when cut in the dry season. We conclude that promoting local use of IAS may be a feasible approach in controlling them and thereby limiting their impacts in forests.'

This paper reviews the studies that have tried to estimate the value of forest ecosystem services. Broadly, this study addresses the following questions: (1) What insights do these studies provide on the value of forest ecosystems? (2) What lessons do they offer from an economic and policy perspective? (3) What are the shortcomings of the existing studies, and what are the challenges and issues for future research? Evidence from a cross section of forest sites, countries and regions suggests that not only the total valuation of ecosystem services varies widely across studies but also the valuation of individual services. This variation suggests that policies to conserve ecosystems and their services should emphasise local contexts and values.

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Invasiveness of two plants with varied phenology was assessed using modelling.\xe2\x80\xa2Use of three models abetted identifying determinants with reasonable poise.\xe2\x80\xa2Species with advantages of growth complementarity could succeed invasion.\xe2\x80\xa2Study of multiple species invasion in overlain niches offers management inputs.AbstractUnderstanding the impact of climate change on species invasion is crucial for sustainable biodiversity conservation. Through this study, we try to answer how species differing in phenological cycles, specifically Cassia tora and Lantana camara, differ in the manner in which they invade new regions in India in the future climate. Since both species occupy identical niches, exploring their invasive potential in different climate change scenarios will offer critical insights into invasion and inform ecosystem management. We use three modelling protocols (i.e., maximum entropy, generalised linear model and generalised additive model) to predict the current distribution. Projections are made for both moderate (A1B) and extreme (A2) IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) scenarios for the year 2050 and 2100. The study reveals that the distributions of C.\xc2\xa0tora (annual) and L.\xc2\xa0camara (perennial) would depend on the precipitation of the warmest quarter and moisture availability. C.\xc2\xa0tora may demonstrate physiological tolerance to the mean diurnal temperature range and L.\xc2\xa0camara to the solar radiation. C.\xc2\xa0tora may invade central India, while L.\xc2\xa0camara may invade the Western Himalaya, parts of the Eastern Himalaya and the Western Ghats. The distribution ranges of both species could shift in the northern and north-eastern directions in India, owing to changes in moisture availability. The possible alterations in precipitation regimes could lead to water stress, which might have cascading effects on species invasion. L.\xc2\xa0camara might adapt to climate change better compared with C.\xc2\xa0tora. This comparative analysis of the future distributions of two invasive plants with contrasting habits demonstrates that temporal complementarity would prevail over the competition.'

The total above ground biomass carbon stock of Indian forest was calculated as 3070.27\xc2\xa0Tg\xc2\xa0C in 2013. Standing biomass carbon stocks varied significantly during different steps of time periods. There are a total 67,184 grid cells with loss of carbon stocks during 1930\xe2\x80\x931975 followed by 55,742 cells during 1975\xe2\x80\x931985. The annual carbon loss in the above ground biomass showed the highest decrease during the period of 1930 to 1975 and estimated as 2168.50\xc2\xa0Tg\xc2\xa0C while the net annual loss of carbon is 48.19\xc2\xa0Tg\xc2\xa0C. The maximum observed net annual loss of carbon stocks was 53.97\xc2\xa0Tg\xc2\xa0C during 2005 to 2013. Carbon content for various states shows that maximum carbon stocks were stored in the forests of Arunachal Pradesh (11.27%) in 2013. State-wise change analysis indicates the highest loss of carbon stocks in Tripura (80.99%) from 1930 to 2013. Overall reduction in carbon stock in Indian forests has been estimated as 3079.98\xc2\xa0Tg\xc2\xa0C (50.08%) from 1930 to 2013. The spatial characterization of distribution and changes in carbon stocks can provide useful information for planning and strategic management of resources and fulfilling global initiatives to conserve forest biodiversity.'

Title: 'Exploring biodiversity and climate change benefits of community-based forest management'

Abstract: 'AbstractEmissions from deforestation are significant and account for more than 18% of global annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. With the Bali Action Plan categorically placing reduced emissions from degradation and deforestation (REDD) activities on the agenda of future climate change negotiations, there is now a strong possibility that policy approaches and incentives relating to enhancement of carbon stocks in low biomass forests will be successfully negotiated and accepted as a legitimate greenhouse gas mitigation option in the upcoming post-2012 climate change regime. Using the institutional mechanisms provided by community-based forest management (CBFM), 833.8\xc2\xa0Tg carbon can be sequestered by enhancement of forest carbon stocks in low biomass Indian forests. By protection refugia, restoring biodiversity, providing connectivity, mimicking nature in plantations and controlling man-made fires, CBFM as practiced in India can be an effective way of managing forests during times of climate change. Appropriately designed CBFM policy can provide means to sustain and strengthen community livelihoods and at the same time avoid deforestation, restore forest cover and density, provide carbon mitigation and create rural assets. Channeling carbon investment funds into CBFM projects can make both development and conservation economically viable and attractive for the local communities to maintain biodiversity and integrity of nature. However, before actual funding under the Clean Development Mechanism and other international C investment funds is available, policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to REDD need to be negotiated and agreed upon by the participating nations to UNFCCC.'

Abstract: 'AbstractLarge investments are being made in the establishment of tree plantations on degraded land in Asia. These initiatives are often politically driven and aspire to achieve both economic and environmental benefits. However, the lack of clarity about the precise objectives of these schemes means that they often fail to yield either local economic or global environmental benefits. There is often a failure to negotiate with all concerned stakeholders and to recognize and resolve trade-offs. Subsidies have often had perverse impacts, and market forces may be better drivers of economic objectives of restoration programmes. Security of tenure and use rights is an important but often neglected requirement for achieving sustainability. Remnant patches of natural vegetation, even when degraded, are often valuable sources of local biodiversity in restoration schemes. The spatial patterns of different types of forest and of non-forest land are important determinants of environmental values. Biodiversity conservation requires maintaining or re-establishing habitat strips to connect natural forest blocks and protect ecological gradients. However, even monoculture plantations often have significant biodiversity value. The fundamental principles of ecosystem approaches as adopted by the Convention for the Conservation of Biological Diversity and principles for successful common property resource management provide valuable frameworks for forest restoration schemes.'

Title: 'Processes controlling silicon isotopic fractionation in a forested tropical watershed: Mule Hole Critical Zone Observatory (Southern India)'
Author: 'Jean'

Abstract: 'AbstractAssessing the dynamics of the silica cycle in the critical zone remains challenging, particularly within the soil, where multiple processes are involved. To improve our understanding of this cycle in the Tropics, and more specifically the role played by vegetation, we combined elemental Si mass balance with the \xce\xb430Si signatures of the compartments involved in the water-plant-rock interactions of a tropical forested watershed, Mule Hole (Southern India). To accomplish this, we analysed (1) the \xce\xb430Si values of present-day litter phytoliths from tree leaves and grass, as well as soil amorphous silica (ASi); (2) the Si isotope fractionation induced by phytolith dissolution; (3) the silicon mass balance inferred from isotopes at the soil\xe2\x80\x93plant scale; and (4) the consistency between water sources and the \xce\xb430Si signatures in the ephemeral stream.The \xce\xb430Si values of present-day litter phytoliths and soil ASi vary within a narrow range of 1.10\xe2\x80\x931.40\xe2\x80\xb0 for all samples, but two deep vertisol samples which likely trapped phytoliths from different vegetation growing under more humid conditions, as indicated by pollen analysis. A homogeneous signature of litter is a minimum condition for using \xce\xb430Si as a proxy for the litter/phytolith source of Si. However, litter-ash dissolution experiments demonstrate that the incipient dissolution of phytoliths fractionates Si isotopes, with the preferential dissolution of 28Si over 30Si yielding \xce\xb430Si values as low as \xe2\x88\x921.41\xe2\x80\xb0. Values close to the whole-sample signatures, i.e., above 1\xe2\x80\xb0, were recovered in the solution after a few hours of water-ash interaction. At the soil\xe2\x80\x93plant scale, the average \xce\xb430Si value of soil-infiltrating solutions is slightly lighter than the average phytolith signature, which suggests phytoliths as the source of soil dissolved Si. The isotopic budget of dissolved Si within the soil layer, which was obtained based on previous elemental fluxes, is imbalanced. Equilibrating the isotopic budget would imply that up to 4100\xe2\x80\xafmol\xe2\x80\xafha\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\xafyr\xe2\x88\x921 of silica is taken up by vegetation, which is almost twice as large as that initially estimated from the elemental budget. The additional Si flux taken up, and likely stored in woody stems, was estimated assuming that Si isotopes followed a steady-state model for the whole Si plant uptake and then followed a Rayleigh model once in the plants. The \xce\xb430Si value of the additional Si flux taken up should be close to 0\xe2\x80\xb0, i.e., enriched in light Si isotopes compared to the litter. If steady-state conditions apply, the source could correspond to soil ASi dissolution or deep (saprolite) root uptake. At the outlet of the watershed, the stream exhibits low \xce\xb430Si values (0.28\xe2\x80\x930.71\xe2\x80\xb0) during peak flows and high \xce\xb430Si values (1.29\xe2\x80\x931.61\xe2\x80\xb0) during the recessions at the end of the rainy season. Heavy \xce\xb430Si signatures are consistent with the expected domination of seepage at the end of floods. The light \xce\xb430Si values during peak flow are slightly lower than the overland flow signature and reflect either a sampling bias of overland flow or a minor but significant contribution of another Si source within the stream, possibly the partial dissolution of phytoliths from the suspended load, with slight isotopic fractionation. This study confirms that vegetation controls the silicon cycle in this dry tropical forest. It also shows that silicon isotopes yield a better grasp of the mass balance and sources and potential mechanisms involved than the consideration of only silicon concentrations. However, this proxy still relies on working hypotheses, notably steady-state and/or Rayleigh fractionation models, which need to be confirmed in further studies.'

Title: 'And yet it shrinks: A novel method for correcting bias in forest tree growth estimates caused by water-induced fluctuations'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Reversible stem shrinkage was estimated using tape and tree-ring measured growth.\xe2\x80\xa2This \xe2\x80\x98water growth\xe2\x80\x99 explained the variations in tape measured growth in a few trees.\xe2\x80\xa2It was effective as a proxy to estimate census-wise bias at the community level.\xe2\x80\xa2Proxy effectivity was sensitive to tree size and census timing, but not species.\xe2\x80\xa2This approach has potential for reinterpretation of temporal trends in tree growth.AbstractAccuracy in tree woody growth estimates is important to global carbon budget estimation and climate-change science. Tree growth in permanent sampling plots (PSPs) is commonly estimated by measuring stem diameter changes, but this method is susceptible to bias resulting from water-induced reversible stem shrinkage. In the absence of bias correction, temporal variability in growth is likely to be overestimated and incorrectly attributed to fluctuations in resource availability, especially in forests with high seasonal and inter-annual variability in water. We propose and test a novel approach for estimating and correcting this bias at the community level.In a 50-ha PSP from a seasonally dry tropical forest in southern India, where tape measurements have been taken every four years from 1988 to 2012, for nine trees we estimated bias due to reversible stem shrinkage as the difference between woody growth measured using tree rings and that estimated from tape. We tested if the bias estimated from these trees could be used as a proxy to correct bias in tape-based growth estimates at the PSP scale.We observed significant shrinkage-related bias in the growth estimates of the nine trees in some censuses. This bias was strongly linearly related to tape-based growth estimates at the level of the PSP, and could be used as a proxy. After bias was corrected, the temporal variance in growth rates of the PSP decreased, while the effect of exceptionally dry or wet periods was retained, indicating that at least a part of the temporal variability arose from reversible shrinkage-related bias. We also suggest that the efficacy of the bias correction could be improved by measuring the proxy on trees that belong to different size classes and census timing, but not necessarily to different species.Our approach allows for reanalysis \xe2\x80\x93 and possible reinterpretation \xe2\x80\x93 of temporal trends in tree growth, above ground biomass change, or carbon fluxes in forests, and their relationships with resource availability in the context of climate change.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Study pertains to the tropics.\xe2\x80\xa2Characterizes the relationships between forest cover, turbidity and treatment cost.\xe2\x80\xa2Estimates deforestation induced costs on drinking water treatment plant.\xe2\x80\xa2Highlights the need for municipalities to include forests in decision making.AbstractThe success of incorporating natural capital into resource- and land-use decisions hinges on the ability to quantify the ecosystem services, forecast the returns to the investments, convert these values into effective policy and finance mechanisms, and the presence of well-functioning institutions and infrastructure. However, ecosystem production functions i.e., the relationship between regulatory functions of the ecosystem and the economic activity it protects or supports are often poorly understood. Even with respect to Forest Watershed Services \xe2\x80\x93 a service that is widely recognized and even institutionalized through market based mechanisms in some parts of the world \xe2\x80\x93 the biophysical relationships between forests and services such as stream flow stabilization, water quality and water quantity are undefined, particularly for the tropics.

At an annual rate of change in the forest cover by \xe2\x88\x920.0088% (average annual rate of change in the forest cover between the years 1994\xe2\x80\x932007) the deforestation induced costs translate to 3.73 million Indian rupee/year ($0.075\xc2\xa0million/year) according to the 2010\xe2\x80\x932011 prices for the Panjrapur treatment plant of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. Thus, if deforestation is avoided the Municipal Corporation can save significant amount towards recurring costs of water treatment and to some extent mitigate the costs for the development of a new source.'

Abstract: "AbstractObjectiveTo report the patterns of species diversity, and regenerating capacity in the forest of Nikyal valley in relation to environmental variables and underlying anthropogenic influence.MethodsA study area was selected in a traditionally managed mountain woody pasture during July 2012 to June 2013. The area was sampled by quadrat method. The quadrats were laid down at regular intervals of 150 m. The size of quadrats was kept 10\xc3\x9710, 5\xc3\x975 and 1\xc3\x971 m2 for trees, shrubs and herbs respectively. Density, frequency and cover were recorded. Importance value index of each plant species was calculated and plant communities were named after the plant species having the highest IV. Then diversity, its components and regenerating capacity were calculated with their formulas.ResultsShannon's diversity ranged from 2.75 to 3.31, Simpson's diversity, 0.90 to 0.95; Menhinick's diversity, 0.83 to 1.19; evenness, 0.41 to 0.65; species richness, 4.89 to 6.08 and maturity index, 30 to 44 species distribution pattern. Diversity values were similar to the other Himalayan forests. Pinus roxburghaii was the only regenerating species whereas the remaining four tree species including Qurecus dilatata regenerate up to 100 cm; they are at extreme risk of elimination due to anthropogenic factors.ConclusionsNikyal valley is under severe deforestation pressure for fuel and timber value. There is an urgent need to promote the ethics among the people that improvement and conservation of natural resources are critical for land and soil management."

Results reveal well defined bimodal diurnal pattern in BC mass; one in morning (07:00-09:00 LT) and another in evening (around 20:00 LT) at both sites.

Title: 'Tropical forest recovery: legacies of human impact and natural disturbances'
Author: 'Robin L.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1433831904700670
Abstract: "AbstractLand-use history interacts with natural forces to influence the severity of disturbance events and the rate and nature of recovery processes in tropical forests. Although we are far from an integrated view of forest recovery processes, some generalizations can be made. Recovery of forest structure and composition is relatively rapid following disturbances that primarily impact forest canopies, such as hurricanes. Recovery is considerably slower following disturbances that heavily impact soils as well as aboveground vegetation, such as bulldozing, heavy or long-term grazing, and severe fires, often with long-lasting effects on species composition. The landscape matrix plays a critical role in local recovery processes. Proximity of disturbed areas to remnant forest patches promotes more rapid recovery, which depends heavily on seed dispersal. Recovery of aboveground biomass is constrained by soil fertility and texture across regions as well as across soil types within a region. Restoration of soil fertility may be a prerequisite for forest recovery on sites with severely degraded soils. Despite evidence of rapid forest recovery following large-scale deforestation, many degraded areas of today's tropics will require human assistance to recover forest structure, species composition, and species interactions typical of mature tropical forests."

Abstract: 'AbstractPlanning and management decisions concerning forest resources require the integration of large volumes of disparate information from numerous sources, which in turn, need different techniques and tools. The present work attempts to develop an integrated range management decision support system (IRMDSS) to provide an interactive decision support tool for forest planners in the Western Ghats of India, which is one of the ecologically important areas of the Earth. The IRMDSS interface combines individual technologies such as remote sensing, a geographic information system (GIS) and a knowledge based system. The prototype IRMDSS was developed by customizing arcview gis software and coupling it other software using dynamic link libraries. The IRMDSS prototype provides forest planners and managers a better means of organizing, accessing, and evaluating a wide range of information and alternative strategies for effective forest planning and management in the study area.'

Abstract: 'AbstractSustainable harvesting of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and associated livelihood security can be affected by forest disturbances additional to harvesting. Amla (Phyllanthus emblica and Phyllanthus indofischeri) is a locally and nationally significant NTFP in India, exploited for its fruit. We examined the infection of these two species by a hemiparasitic mistletoe and investigated two alternative management approaches.Forest surveys, mistletoe removal experiments and seed deposition surveys were employed to assess the prevalence of mistletoe infection, characteristics of infection in relation to resource value and the appropriateness of local versus institutional management approaches. The results suggest mistletoe infection is widespread in the study site, affecting over half of the Amla population, and in particular those reproductive trees important for population persistence. Infection characteristics and resource values differ between the two Phyllanthus species, having significant implications for Amla collectors. Institutional perspectives on the management of this species conflict with local practice. Cutting of branches by collectors has previously been considered destructive, but may in fact have management benefits in terms of increased productivity through re-sprouts and reduced risk of mistletoe infection. However, neither mistletoe removal by hand, nor branch cutting appear to offer a viable control strategy in isolation. A multifarious strategy including new approaches to management is needed to safeguard the role of this resource in local livelihoods.'

Abstract: 'AbstractManagement of natural forests might be one option to reduce the high deforestation rate in Ecuador. We therefore evaluated the response of water and nutrient cycles in a natural tropical montane forest to improvement fellings with the aim of favoring economically valuable target trees which will later be harvested with additional ecosystem impacts not considered here.The study was conducted at ca. 1900\xe2\x80\x932200\xc2\xa0m above sea level in the south Ecuadorian Andes on the east-exposed slope of the east cordillera. In June 2004, one of two paired ca. 10-ha large catchments was thinned by felling 10.2% of the initial basal area (dbh\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa5\xc2\xa010\xc2\xa0cm) on 30% of the catchment. The stems remained in situ. We measured ecosystem fluxes from rainfall via throughfall and stemflow to soil solution (litter leachate, soil solution at 15 and 30\xc2\xa0cm depth) and stream flow between May 2004 and May 2005. After the fellings, soil solutions were extracted from the gaps created by the felled trees and the forest next to the gaps. We determined aboveground water fluxes by direct measurement and soil water fluxes with a budget approach. In the solutions, we measured concentrations of NH4+-N, NO3\xe2\x88\x92-N, total dissolved N, PO43\xe2\x88\x92-P, total dissolved P, Ca, Mg, K, Na, and Cl\xe2\x88\x92. Fluxes were calculated as volume-weighted mean (vwm) concentrations times water fluxes. Dry deposition was estimated using Cl\xe2\x88\x92 as inert tracer.The fellings increased concentrations of N, K, Ca, and Mg in the organic layer of the resulting gaps compared with the forest next to the gaps (vwm concentrations of N: 6.4\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 in the forest next to the gap/8.7\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 in the gaps, K: 9.8/11, Mg: 1.8/3.0, Ca: 3.4/5.8). Lower nutrient concentrations and fluxes in the mineral soil of the gaps than in forest next to the gaps suggested that these nutrients were taken up by ground vegetation and target trees. The paired modified and undisturbed catchments had similar water and nutrient budgets. The fellings did not have a significant impact on the water and nutrient budget at the catchment scale.'

Title: 'Biodiversity conservation and livelihoods in human-dominated landscapes: Forest commons in South Asia'
Author: 'Lauren'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320710000923
Abstract: 'AbstractStrict protected areas are a critical component in global biodiversity conservation, but the future of biodiversity conservation may well depend upon the ability to experiment successfully with a range of institutional forms, including those that permit human use. Here, we focus on forest commons in human-dominated landscapes and their role in biodiversity conservation at the same time as they provide livelihood benefits to users. Using a dataset of 59 forest commons located in Bhutan, India, and Nepal, we estimated tree species richness from plot vegetation data collected in each forest, and drew on interview data to calculate a livelihoods index indicating the overall contribution of each forest to villager livelihoods for firewood, fodder, and timber. We found that tree species richness and livelihoods were positively and significantly correlated (rho\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0.41, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001, N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa059). This relationship held regardless of forest type or country, though significance varied somewhat across these two factors. Further, both benefits were similarly associated with several drivers of social-ecological change (e.g., occupational diversity of forest users, total number of users, and forest size), suggesting identification of potential synergies and complexes of causal mechanisms for future attention. Our analysis shows that forest commons in South Asia, explicitly managed to provide livelihoods for local populations, also provide biodiversity benefits. More broadly, our findings suggest that although strict protected areas are effective tools for biodiversity conservation, a singular focus on them risks ignoring other resource governance approaches that can fruitfully complement existing conservation regimes.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Baseline soil properties of rainforest, tea-land, fern-land, and pine.\xe2\x80\xa2Legacy effects of land conversion to agriculture from fertilization and fire.\xe2\x80\xa2Both \xce\xb413C and \xce\xb415N increased with depth under pine and fern-lands.\xe2\x80\xa2Natural regeneration beneath pine facilitates faster decomposition.AbstractWhile soils can act either as a source or as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide and nitrogen, depending on land cover change and management, there is a great need to improve our understanding of the dynamics of soil structure and chemistry following land conversion in tropical regions. In this study, we investigated various soil structural and chemical variables (bulk density, pH, cation exchange capacity, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium), soil carbon (C), soil nitrogen (N), \xce\xb413C, and \xce\xb415N in relation to conversion of rain forest to tea cultivation and subsequent changes due to agricultural abandonment and reforestation with Caribbean pine. Although Caribbean pine has shown potential for reforestation throughout Asia and Latin America, effects on soil properties in comparison with other land uses have not been quantified. Our study compared: (1) the original mixed-dipterocarp rain forest, (2) tea plantations, (3) Kekilla fernlands and (4) Caribbean pine plantations. Tea plantations show higher bulk density (BD) as an evidence of compaction. Although soil C concentration in tea plantations were lower than other land uses at 0\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0cm, when bulk density was used with C as a composite measure, tea plantation showed the highest value for both soil C and N stocks. Disregarding tea plantations, Caribbean pine plantations had the highest C but showed the lowest N stocks at both soil depths. Soil \xce\xb413C and \xce\xb415N values of all land uses increase with increasing soil depth; but Caribbean pine plantations showed the greatest increase in \xce\xb413C at both soil depths (e.g. \xe2\x88\x9227.82\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.38\xe2\x80\xb0 at 0\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0cm to \xe2\x88\x9226.50\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.37\xe2\x80\xb0 at 10\xe2\x80\x9320\xc2\xa0cm). For both Kekilla fernlands and Caribbean pine plantations the relationship between \xce\xb413C and \xce\xb415N was strongly linear. By comparing the physical and chemical soil properties of these land uses with undisturbed rain forest, we established baseline data to determine influence of land conversion on soil properties. Based on soil pH, CEC and other major nutrients (P, K, Mg), there are strong legacy effects of land use potentially from both fertilization and fire. Our results also showed strong evidence that \xce\xb413C and \xce\xb415N was both increased with depth under pine reforestation and fernlands, suggesting soils can recuperate with a consistent input of litter and slower decomposition processes. There is some evidence that recruitment of natural regeneration beneath pine can help facilitate faster litter decomposition that can revert soil structure and fertility to a status similar to that of the original forest.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe tropical rainforest in the south-western Ghats of Kerala State was surveyed in May 1993 with the help of trained volunteers and Forest department staff to assess the status and distribution of the endangered lion-tailed macaque Macaca silenus. A total of 564 macaques in 64 troops were sighted during the survey. It is estimated that the number of lion-tailed macaques in Kerala is a minimum of 1216 but only three areas are identified as having viable populations with long-term conservation prospects. Most sightings of troops were in Protected Areas. The present survey indicates its absence in the ranges reported earlier, such as Cardamom Hills and South Wayanad. Maintenance of existing contiguous patches of evergreen forest and inclusion of suitable management strategies in Working Plans for non-Protected Areas are suggested.'

Title: 'Measuring biomass changes due to woody encroachment and deforestation/degradation in a forest\xe2\x80\x93savanna boundary region of central Africa using multi-temporal L-band radar backscatter'

Abstract: 'AbstractSatellite L-band synthetic aperture radar backscatter data from 1996 and 2007 (from JERS-1 and ALOS PALSAR respectively), were used with field data collected in 2007 and a back-calibration method to produce biomass maps of a 15\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0km2 forest\xe2\x80\x93savanna ecotone region of central Cameroon. The relationship between the radar backscatter and aboveground biomass (AGB) was strong (r2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.86 for ALOS HV to biomass plots, r2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.95 relating ALOS-derived biomass for 40 suspected unchanged regions to JERS-1 HH). The root mean square error (RMSE) associated with AGB estimation varied from ~\xc2\xa025% for AGB\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa0100\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01 to ~\xc2\xa040% for AGB\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0100\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01 for the ALOS HV data. Change detection showed a significant loss of AGB over high biomass forests, due to suspected deforestation and degradation, and significant biomass gains along the forest\xe2\x80\x93savanna boundary, particularly in areas of low population density. Analysis of the errors involved showed that radar data can detect changes in broad AGB class in forest\xe2\x80\x93savanna transition areas with an accuracy >\xc2\xa095%. However, quantitative assessment of changes in AGB in Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01 at a pixel level will require radar images from sensors with similar characteristics collecting data from the same season over multiple years.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Fire emissions in South Asia have a noticeable impact on the O3 in this region.\xe2\x80\xa2Simulations with fire emissions show better agreement with observations.\xe2\x80\xa2Surface O3 production of 3.5\xc2\xa0Tg is estimated during spring season.AbstractIn this study, for the first time, the influence of springtime (MAM) biomass burning in South Asia on regional ozone (O3) distribution has been evaluated using a regional chemical transport model (WRF-Chem) and the Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINNv1). Model results are compared with satellite retrievals of tropospheric column amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) from MOPITT and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from OMI. With daily varying emissions, the model captures reasonably well the satellite-derived temporal variations in CO and NO2 (index of agreement (R) for CO is 0.83 and for NO2 is 0.76), indicating the effectiveness of the model in estimating the overall fire impact on a regional scale. Simulated tropospheric NO2 concentration shows better agreement with the magnitude of observed NO2 when FINNv1 NOx emissions are reduced by a factor of 2.2 over the model domain. A clear increase in CO and NO2 levels over Burma (35\xe2\x80\x9360%), Central India (15\xe2\x80\x9330%), the Indo-Gangetic (15\xe2\x80\x9325%) region and the Bay of Bengal (15\xe2\x80\x9340%) are simulated with fire emissions. The model results are also used to quantify the net O3 production from fires. Calculated O3 productions are up to 4\xc2\xa0ppb\xc2\xa0h\xe2\x88\x921 over inland and up to 0.1\xc2\xa0ppb\xc2\xa0h\xe2\x88\x921 over marine regions respectively. Our model-based analysis yields average enhancement ratios \xce\x94O3/\xce\x94CO of 0.12\xc2\xa0ppbv/ppbv and a total O3 production of about 3.5\xc2\xa0Tg from South Asia during the spring season. The findings demonstrate that the springtime fire emissions in South Asia have a noticeable impact on the O3 in this region.'

Title: 'Palaeovegetation and climate oscillation of western Odisha, India: A pollen data-based synthesis for the Mid-Late Holocene'
Author: 'Swati'

Abstract: "AbstractThe last 6000 years are of particular interest to the understanding of the Earth System because the boundary conditions of the climate system did not change dramatically (in comparison to larger glacial\xe2\x80\x93interglacial changes), and because abundant, detailed regional palaeoclimatic proxy records cover this period. Here, we present fossil pollen data and examine their climatic interpretation based on a 200-cm-deep trenched sedimentary profile from Mahanadi river side, located near the Barpahar hillock of Bargarh District, Odisha, which is influenced by the South-west and North-east monsoon. The 5840\xc2\xa0y chronology of the sediment core is based on three 14C dates on soil samples. During 5840\xe2\x80\x934380\xc2\xa0BP, dense tropical mixed deciduous forest consisting of Madhuca, Syzygium and Acacia flourished in the region along with Rhizophora under a warm and humid climate governed by high monsoonal activity. This phase of climate is associated with the Holocene Climatic Optimum which falls within the temporal range of 8000\xe2\x80\x935000\xc2\xa0BP. Subsequently, an increase in humidity was discerned between 4380 and 3230\xc2\xa0BP, as evident by increase in forest elements, under warm and relatively humid climate in response to an increased monsoon. The climate during 3230\xe2\x80\x931860\xc2\xa0BP was mild and in general less humid than today. This climate event was inevitably influenced by a notable global cold event 4200 years ago, which is synchronous with the collapse of the world's first human empire in Mesopotamia. After this event, there was a return of more humid climate from 1860 to 1300\xc2\xa0BP, marked by high values of Potamogeton, Myriophyllum, Nymphoides, and fungal and trilete fern spores. This is further supported by the presence of Rhizophora and Sonneratia indicating high precipitation under the influence of coastal habitation. A striking signal of the Little Ice age (LIA) was observed since 1300\xc2\xa0BP when the climate became relatively dry, as recognized in a sudden decline in major arboreals, along with high frequency of occurrence of dry herbs. This changing pattern of humidity was also reflected in the proportions of marshy/aquatic taxa, as well as ruderal taxa which is a result of human impact. The study will be helpful to display the palaeovegetation and climate in the region between Bengal and the Ganga plain."

Title: 'Population and conservation status of the Nilgiri tahr Hemitragus hylocrius in Anamalai Hills, south India'
Author: 'Charudutt'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe endangered Nilgiri tahr Hemitragus hylocrius is endemic to the Western Ghats mountains in south India. The largest existing population inhabits the Anamalai conservation unit (Anamalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary, and Eravikulam National Park) straddling the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. We undertook a survey to assess the conservation status of Nilgiri tahr in the Anamalai-Parambikulam area of the conservation unit. Altogether, 348 tahr were sighted in 12 separate grassland areas, including two populations which had not been recorded previously. The present population of Nilgiri tahr in Anamalai and Parambikulam sanctuaries is estimated to be between 570 and 690 animals. Together with the Eravikulam population, the Anamalai conservation unit therefore contains some 1400 Nilgiri tahr. We found evidence of poaching in five of the 12 areas surveyed. Tahr habitat is also threatened by the spread of wattle Acacia mearnsii in one area, and by extensive livestock grazing in another. Comparisons are made with the successful conservation measures taken in Eravikulam and recommendations made for control of poaching in Anamalai\xe2\x80\x93Parambikulam area.'

Title: 'ReviewIndigenous exploitation and management of tropical forest resources: an evolutionary continuum in forest-people interactions'
Author: 'K.F.'

Abstract: 'AbstractSince the early 1980s several new approaches towards forest management, which include active participation of local communities, have been tried out in many tropical regions. As a result of these efforts recognition has increased about the various ways in which many local communities are already actively managing their forest resources. The planning of development interventions to stimulate more efficient community involvement in forest management can often be based on such indigenous forest management systems. This paper aims to improve the understanding about the diversity and dynamics of indigenous forest management. The analysis consists of three parts. First an overview of the various types of indigenous forest management and their dynamics is presented. Subsequently, the basic principles of forest management are discussed. Forest management is characterized as involving a set of both technical activities and social arrangements for the protection and utilization of forest resources and the distribution of forest products. Three major categories of forest management practices are identified, e.g. controlled utilization of forest products, protection and maintenance of forest stands, and purposeful regeneration. The practices in the first category are both socially and biologically oriented, whereas the activities of the last two categories are biologically oriented. These principles are then used to develop a classification model of the various evolutionary phases in forest management. Along the lines of a similar model developed for exploitation of agricultural crops, various stages of forest management are distinguished along a gradient of increasing input of human energy per unit of exploited forest. This gradient represents a continuum of forest-people interactions; it illustrates how the various manifestations of indigenous forest management may be arranged along a nature-culture continuum.'

The map was created using an on-screen visual interpretation technique and has an accuracy of 90%, as assessed using 15,565 ground control points. India has hitherto been using potential vegetation/forest type map prepared by Champion and Seth in 1968. We characterized and mapped further the vegetation type distribution in the country in terms of occurrence and distribution, area occupancy, percentage of protected area (PA) covered by each vegetation type, range of elevation, mean annual temperature and precipitation over the past 100 years. A remote sensing-amenable hierarchical classification scheme that accommodates natural and semi-natural systems was conceptualized, and the natural vegetation was classified into forests, scrub/shrub lands and grasslands on the basis of extent of vegetation cover. We discuss the distribution and potential utility of the vegetation type map in a broad range of ecological, climatic and conservation applications from global, national and local perspectives. We used 15,565 ground control points to assess the accuracy of products available globally (i.e., GlobCover, Holdridge\xe2\x80\x99s life zone map and potential natural vegetation (PNV) maps). Hence we recommend that the map prepared herein be used widely. This vegetation type map is the most comprehensive one developed for India so far. It was prepared using 23.5\xc2\xa0m seasonal satellite remote sensing data, field samples and information relating to the biogeography, climate and soil. The digital map is now available through a web portal (http://bis.iirs.gov.in).'

Title: 'Tropical rainforest vegetation, climate and sea level during the Pleistocene in Kerala, India'
Author: 'Anjum'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618209003310
Abstract: 'AbstractThe southwestern Ghats region of the Indian Peninsula is unique for its extant endemic rainforest flora supported by high rainfall throughout the year. The record of tropical rainforest corresponding to the dynamic series of Pleistocene interglacial/glacial cycles is poorly known from peninsular India. This communication discusses the palynological study of organic matter (OM) deposits (>40\xc2\xa0ka BP) in two well sections (Chaganachery, Kerala) from the Indian Peninsula (west coast). A rich archive of tropical rainforest pollen/spores and marine dinoflagellate cysts indicates anoxic fluvio-marine/estuarine depositional environments during warmer climates with an intensified Asian monsoon. The geochemical fingerprinting of glass shards indicates the presence of Youngest Toba ash of \xe2\x88\xbc74\xc2\xa0ka from northern Sumatra, and therefore establishes a time-controlled stratigraphy. Thus, the depositional time period of the OM is related to the sea level highstand of Marine Isotopic Stage 5.1 (\xe2\x88\xbc80\xc2\xa0ka) which was the host to the YTT shards. The Late Quaternary pollen/spores diversity suggests that the modern climatic conditions in the southwestern Ghats have facilitated the conservation of moist evergreen rainforest and dry/moist deciduous forest. The pollen grains show its lineage with the extant flora and some of the fossil pollen recorded during the mesic Tertiary period from the Indian peninsula. Thus, it appears that the tropical rainforest survived here as \xe2\x80\x98Plant Refugia\xe2\x80\x99 in xeric (glacial) Quaternary periods, perhaps as riparian vegetation, and was rejuvenated during the Holocene as modern extant flora.'

Title: 'Pollen production and depositional behaviour of teak (Tectona grandis Linn. F.) and sal (Shorea robusta Gaertn. F.) in tropical deciduous forests of Madhya Pradesh, India: An overview'
Author: 'M.F.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618213004394
Abstract: 'AbstractTeak (Tectona grandis Linn. F.) of the family Verbenaceae and Sal (Shorea robusta Gaertn. F.) of Dipterocarpaceae, are dominating as well as important constituents of tropical deciduous forests of India and Madhya Pradesh, constituting about 24\xe2\x80\x9326% of the total forest flora of the country. These two taxa are high pollen producers, but their pollen grains are retrieved in lesser frequencies in the sediments (surface samples, moss cushions/polsters, samples of sediment profiles/cores). This peculiar behaviour in the representation of their pollen grains could be attributed to poor pollen preservation in the sediments as well as low dispersal efficiency. However, microbial as well as chemical degradation of their pollen in the sediments cannot be ruled out. The number of stamens, flowers, inflorescences on a plant, anther size, pollen grain size, and types and nature of pollination are also related with the abundance of pollen. Genotypes in association with the variations in environmental factors could also govern the pollen production of a particular taxon/variety. In addition to knowing the pollen productivity of the taxa, assessing the representation of the taxa in extant vegetation is helpful in establishing the modern pollen/vegetation relationships which serve as modern analogues for the appropriate explanation of fossil pollen diagrams.'

Title: 'Research paperIndividual-based simulation models for forest succession and management'
Author: 'Jianguo'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037811279403490N
Abstract: 'AbstractIndividual-based forest models simulate forest dynamics on the basis of establishment, growth and death of individual trees. This paper attempts to review and compare two major types of individual-based forest models: growth-yield and gap models. Although the two types of models share some similar features, they differ in model structure and data requirements and play several complementary roles. Growth-yield models are used by foresters to assist timber production and evaluate growth and yield of one to several commercial timber species in managed forests, while gap models are generally developed by ecologists to explore ecological mechanisms and patterns of structure and functional dynamics in natural forest ecosystems. Site-specific environmental and species information is necessary for constructing growth-yield models while gap models require species-specific biological information of individual trees and site-specific environmental data. The growth-yield models are more diverse in terms of model structure. In contrast, gap models belong to the same genealogy and later gap models are ultimately derived from the earliest one although they may vary in detail. In the future, we expect to see more individual-based hybrid models which integrate gap models with growth-yield models and ecophysiological models. As computer technology advances explosively, individual-based models could be much more efficient and user-friendly. There have existed disproportionately few individual-based models for biodiverse forests such as evergreen tropical rain forests. Development of individual-based models for tropical rain forests is more challenging and is being stimulated by new international conservation efforts.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe objectives of this study were to describe the floristic composition, species diversity, similarity and richness among three stages of forest regeneration, and to investigate the influence of the previous land use on species composition in a seasonally dry tropical forest in northwestern Costa Rica. The species diversity and richness of woody stems with diameter greater or equal to 5\xc2\xa0cm in 26 0.1\xc2\xa0ha plots was found to be the greatest in the intermediate stage followed by the late and early stages. The structural changes of this chronosequence of successional stages were quantified with a modification of the Holdridge complexity index. Using satellite imagery for site selection and historical ground truth analysis the influence of past land use and the frequency of anthropogenic disturbances on species composition was illustrated.'

Abstract: 'AbstractLiana infestations can be a problem in forests managed for timber because lianas decrease rates of tree growth, damage tree boles, and inhibit tree regeneration. To determine the area from which lianas colonize tree crowns in a liana-rich moist lowland forest in a timber concession in the Department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, we described \xe2\x80\x9cliana sheds\xe2\x80\x9d of individual canopy trees (the area under the crown and beyond its margins from which lianas colonize trees). In the same area we tested the hypothesis that pre-logging cutting of lianas in a harvested tree\xe2\x80\x99s liana shed reduces post-logging liana infestations. Prior to logging, 73% of 570 trees >10\xc2\xa0cm in DBH representing 12 commercial species, carried at least one liana >2\xc2\xa0cm DBH. Liana-infested trees hosted an average of 9.3 lianas (\xc2\xb10.45 S.E., range: 1\xe2\x80\x9368). The mean area of the crown covered by lianas was 35% (\xc2\xb129.7 S.E.) but some trees (10%) were completely covered by lianas. \xe2\x80\x9cLiana shed areas\xe2\x80\x9d were a function of crown area and varied among tree species. Most lianas on trees were rooted below the crown of their host (90%); the number of lianas decreased with increasing distance from the crown edge, but lianas colonized trees from as far as 8\xc2\xa0m beyond the crown. Overall, there was a significant reduction in the number of lianas in 22 felling gaps 8 months after logging where lianas were cut before logging compared with 22 control gaps. In control gaps, the majority of climbing lianas sprouted from the prostrate stems of fallen canopy lianas (81%), including 3.1\xc2\xa0km/ha of stems that were rooted along the ground before logging. Liana regeneration in gaps after pre-logging liana cutting occurred mainly by stump sprouting (41%) and sprouting from prostrate stems (48%). Pre-felling liana cutting reduced liana cover in felling gaps by 9% only but reduced liana basal area by 69%. The results of this study suggest that tree crown area, shape, and height are among the most important factors determining the likelihood of liana colonization of canopy trees and that pre-logging liana cutting reduces post-logging liana proliferation in logging gaps.'

Author: 'A.M.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837715301915
Abstract: 'AbstractLand use and land cover changes play an important role in the occurrence of vector-borne diseases. It is highly essential to identify the prominent changes responsible for its occurrence so that suitable measures can be adopted. An attempt was made to identify the prominent land use and land cover changes responsible for the spread of chikungunya, malaria, and dengue fever in the State of Kerala, India, using hierarchical cluster analysis and multiple regression analysis. Large extent of water bodies, low land and agricultural land played a significant role on the incidence of chikungunya and malaria. High population density, built-up area and agricultural area favoured dengue fever. Vector-borne diseases were found to be the lowest in places where there is no low land and with higher forest area. Inappropriate disposal of wastes generated in the built-up area might be the reason for the spread of dengue fever. Freshwater in drains of these areas is polluted and form breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Hence much attention is to be paid to provide appropriate treatment and disposal of wastes generated in the built-up area of the State In an evolving urban policy, priority is to be given to the installation of safe treatment and disposal facility of wastes especially, sewage, sullage, and solid waste. The protection of forest land also plays an important role. Economic policy instruments such as Payment for Environment Services (PES) schemes, may constitute a useful tool to encourage an improved land use management through appropriate price signals, such as, for instance, for the preservation of forested areas especially in proximity of highly populated urban environments.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper presents data on the impact of biotic pressure in terms of grazing by livestock and wood cutting by humans on the plant community in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve of India. Grass, and herbaceous plant biomass, number of cattle dung piles, number of woody stems available and damaged by human activities and weed biomass were assessed at different proximity along transects radiating from village-forest boundary to forest interior to measure the ecological impact of livestock grazing and fire wood collection. The grass biomass was positively correlated to overgrazing indicating the adverse effect on natural vegetation by cattle. Woodcutting was intense along the forest boundary and significantly declined as distance increased. Similarly, weed biomass and number of thorny species declined positively with proximity from village-forest boundary and the weed biomass was significantly higher in the pastoral sites compared to residential sites. The results suggest that human impact adversely affects natural vegetation and promotes weed proliferation in forest areas adjoining human settlements in the ecologically important Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Continued anthropogenic pressure could cause reduction in fodder availability to large herbivores like elephants, which in turn leads to an increase in human\xe2\x80\x93elephant conflict.'

Title: 'Harvesting techniques, hemiparasites and fruit production in two non-timber forest tree species in south India'
Author: 'Aditi'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112701007472
Abstract: 'AbstractIncreasing demands for non-timber forest products and their commercial extractions can result in harvesting methods that maximize short term economic gains with little attention to long term ecological consequences. We assessed the ecological impacts of harvesting techniques used by an indigenous group, the Soligas, on the non-timber forest products they extract from the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills, south India. Specifically, we examined patterns of resource availability of two non-timber tree species, Phyllanthus emblica and P. indofischeri, and how the current fruit harvesting techniques influence fruit yields, and susceptibility of trees to infestations by hemiparasitic plants of the Loranthaceae family. We also assessed how hemiparasite infestations affect fruit production and growth rates of Phyllanthus trees. There was considerable variation in fruit production in both species of Phyllanthus from one fruiting season to the next. The Soligas harvest an average of 86% (\xc2\xb117.72%) of the fruit yield on a per tree basis in P. emblica and 94.17% (\xc2\xb16.9%) in the case of P. indofischeri. At the population level, 64.75 and 86.6% of the fruit productivity is harvested in P. emblica and P. indofischeri, respectively. However, not all individuals or populations are harvested. Harvesting techniques used resulted in cutting of 15% of P. indofischeri trees and 5% of P. emblica trees. The current harvesting techniques used by the Soligas reduce fruit production in P. emblica in the following year (R2=0.27,p=0.03). Furthermore, the Soligas selectively harvest fruits from trees that have larger fruit crop sizes in both species. Individual trees that carried a greater load of hemiparasites produced significantly lower fruit yields (P. emblica: r=\xe2\x88\x920.32,p<0.013; P. indofischeri: r=\xe2\x88\x920.73,p<0.001). The presence of hemiparasites significantly affected the growth rates of trees.Current harvesting techniques used by the Soligas have negative impacts on trees of Phyllanthus spp., as do infestations by hemiparasites. Current fruit harvesting strategies and techniques used by the Soligas focus on maximizing the economic returns by adopting methods of extraction such as lopping of branches and cutting of trees. Such practices can ultimately decrease the rates at which the populations grow, thereby making the extraction of Phyllanthus fruits unsustainable. Adopting more sustainable methods of harvesting appears to be one viable solution to the current ecological problem facing the conservation of Phyllanthus trees in the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The characterization of atmospheric Black Carbon (BC) aerosol has been reported over Vijayawada for the first time.\xe2\x80\xa2A significant diurnal and seasonal variation in BC and BB (%) is observed.\xe2\x80\xa2Occurrence of fire events in and around the region during winter and summer seasons reveals the dominance of local BB.\xe2\x80\xa2Higher values of annual mean \xce\xb1 indicates the observation site is dominated by biomass burning aerosols.\xe2\x80\xa2CWT analysis reveals that airmasses arriving from north and central India also influence the observed BC properties.AbstractContinuous measurements of Black Carbon (BC) mass concentration using an advanced multi wavelength Aethalometer (AE-33) during January\xe2\x80\x93December 2016 were carrried out, for the first time, at the premises of KL University, Vijayawada (16.44\xc2\xb0N, 80.62\xc2\xb0E, 30\xe2\x80\xafm amsl), a semi-urban site in the southeast India. The estimates of the percentage contribution of Biomass Burning (BB%) aerosols to total BC concentration is utilised to understand the contribution of anthropogenic activities over the observational site. In this context, the diurnal and seasonal variation of BC mass concentrations and BB (%) contributions have been investigated and the possible sources are examined. A significant diurnal variation in BC concentration is observed with two prominent peaks, one occuring in the morning hours (around 0800\xe2\x80\x930900 IST) and the other occuring in the evening hours (around 2000 IST). Annually, the maximum BC concentration is observed during November (6.88\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf1.56\xe2\x80\xaf\xce\xbcg\xe2\x80\xafm\xe2\x88\x923) and minimum during August (1.7\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.52\xe2\x80\xaf\xce\xbcg\xe2\x80\xafm\xe2\x88\x923) over this location. On a seasonal scale, mean BC mass concentration is highest during winter (DJF, 4.68\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf1.32\xe2\x80\xaf\xce\xbcg\xe2\x80\xafm\xe2\x88\x923) followed by post-monsoon (SON, 4.52\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf2.36\xe2\x80\xaf\xce\xbcg\xe2\x80\xafm\xe2\x88\x923), summer (MAM, 2.44\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.8\xe2\x80\xaf\xce\xbcg\xe2\x80\xafm\xe2\x88\x923) and lowest during monsoon (JJA, 1.83\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.61\xe2\x80\xaf\xce\xbcg\xe2\x80\xafm\xe2\x88\x923). The higher BB (%) contribution is observed during summer (25.21\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf7.02%), while the contribution is minimum in monsoon season (16.83\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf4.15%). Examination of the spectral properties of aerosol absorption in terms of \xc3\x85ngstr\xc3\xb6m exponent (\xce\xb1) indicates that the major contributor of BC over this location is biomass burning (\xce\xb1 ~ 1.66\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.06). This is supported by the higher number of fire counts (obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-MODIS onboard Terra satellite) in and around the study region during winter and summer revealing the higher contribution of BB aerosols. The concentration weighted trajectories (CWT) analysis (based on 5-day airmass back trajectories arriving the receptor site at an altitude of 500\xe2\x80\xafm AGL) reveals that synoptic airmasses arriving from the continental regions located northeast of the observational sites mainly influence the BC properties over Vijayawada.'

Abstract: 'AbstractFine litterfall and nutrient return patterns were studied in three subtropical humid forest stands (7-, 13- and 16-year old), regrowing after selective tree cutting in north-eastern India. The seasonality of fine litterfall was unimodal, with a peak during spring and a trough during rainy season in the forest regrowths of three different ages. The rate of fine litterfall increased with increasing basal area of the woody vegetation during forest regrowth. Leaf litter accounted for 83% of the total litterfall. N concentration was maximum during autumn and minimum during rainy season; nutrient concentrations were highest in the leaf litter. Seasonal variation in P concentration was small. Maximum and minimum input of N and P to the forest floor through fine litter coincided with the respective periods of litter production.'

This has contributed to the current knowledge of the landscape in association with the flora and megalith culture that prevailed in South India during the Early Historic time at 540\xe2\x80\x93410\xc2\xa0cal BCE. Evidence shows that Early Historic megalith people engaged less in pastoral activities on the open landscape, dominated by herbs e.g., Cyperaceae and Poaceae, and also by Palmae species in semi-arid environment. The presence of strong mode of settled-paddy and millet farming cultures, cereal-processing activities and grazing in association with the burial practices were significant as early as 6th century BCE. Seeds, leaves and sheath from domesticated rice, millet and some materials from sedges and Palmae species were deliberately deposited indicating variable burial rituals in each grave. Burial tradition indicates that Iron Age and Early Historic megalithic people of southern India may have carried out burial rituals with more rice than millets. Evidence for the early appearance of Brahmi writing as part of the \xe2\x80\x98complex\xe2\x80\x99 megalith social life marks the beginning of Early Historic Period, previously not reported in southern Asia. Phytolith evidence also provides new insight into the transformation of urban-fringe landscapes with possible irrigated agriculture in those broad ecological and cultural contexts.'

Abstract: 'AbstractFrom the ancient time, the Northeast part of India is rich in biodiversity because of its diverse topographic, climatic features. Different varieties of mammalian, avian, and herpetofauna are endemic to this region. Unfortunately, life of this diverse flora and fauna is in jeopardy due to serious anthropogenic pressure. Once a large number of globally important species sustained in the Barak Valley. However, with the increasing population and subsequent demand on natural resources and developing activities, many of the species are no more found in the valley. If the conservation action is not initiated, the remaining species will also vanish with time. This article highlights the distribution and conservation problems of four endangered species in the Barak Valley of Assam, India and recommended conservation tactics.'

Decision-making documents in the Supreme Court and in one specific case of a bauxite mining conflict involving Vedanta in the Niyamgiri hills are studied to come to conclusions about how economic valuation of forests has moved through the political process. We argue that establishing NPV for forests is neither conducive to conservation nor to environmental justice for the following three reasons. The technical and political process of setting prices deepens and reproduces structural inequalities with negative distributive effects. NPV encourages economistic decision-making procedures that exclude participation. Finally NPV does not recognize or take into account cultural difference or plural values. We thus conclude that economic valuation of forest products and services has not managed to \xe2\x80\x9csave\xe2\x80\x9d forests in India and is not an effective or viable strategy for expressing the value of forests or for environmental conservation and environmental justice activism.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThousands of human lives are lost every year around the globe, apart from significant damage on property, animal life, etc., due to natural disasters (e.g., earthquake, flood, tsunami, hurricane and other storms, landslides, cloudburst, heat wave, forest fire). In this paper, we focus on reviewing the application of data mining and analytical techniques designed so far for (i) prediction, (ii) detection, and (iii) development of appropriate disaster management strategy based on the collected data from disasters. A detailed description of availability of data from geological observatories (seismological, hydrological), satellites, remote sensing and newer sources like social networking sites as twitter is presented. An extensive and in-depth literature study on current techniques for disaster prediction, detection and management has been done and the results are summarized according to various types of disasters. Finally a framework for building a disaster management database for India hosted on open source Big Data platform like Hadoop in a phased manner has been proposed. The study has special focus on India which ranks among top five counties in terms of absolute number of the loss of human life.'

Abstract: 'AbstractInterspecific variation in water-induced fluctuations in stem girth demonstrates the mechanisms promoting coexistence in seasonally dry tropical forest. In addition, these fluctuations are a potential, but unevaluated, source of bias in measurements of annual tree growth rates. To examine diurnal and seasonal patterns of stem diameter change, tree girth was measured over 2 years (1997\xe2\x80\x931999), using dendrometer bands, for three species (Celtis mildbraedii, C. zenkeri and Strombosia glaucescens) in semi-deciduous forest in Ghana. Soil matric potential was measured concurrently at 15\xc2\xa0cm depth. In addition, measurements of all trees >20\xc2\xa0cm dbh on three, 1\xc2\xa0ha plots were made at the beginning and middle of the 1998/1999 dry season. During the severe 1997/1998 dry season, soil matric potential declined below \xe2\x88\x921.5\xc2\xa0MPa and two species showed significant stem shrinkage. For the evergreen species, C. mildbraedii, there was a significant positive effect of tree diameter on stem shrinkage, and shrinkage was greater in the second, compared to the first, half of the dry season. For the deciduous species, C. zenkeri, shrinkage was reduced during the second half of the dry season, following leaf fall. During 1998/1999, soil matric potential, did not decline below \xe2\x88\x921.5\xc2\xa0MPa, and rates of girth change remained positive for all species. There were no significant effects of size or phenology on the rate of girth change in the plot-based study. Deviations in annual increment calculated over successive monthly intervals indicate that a 10-fold difference in soil water availability between measurement occasions can lead to a 4% bias in estimates of annual growth. Measurements of forest plots should be made when inter-annual variation in soil water availability is low. In this forest, measurements should, therefore, be made during the wet season, contrary to published recommendations.'

Title: 'PaperConserved to death: Are tropical forests being overprotected from people?'
Author: 'David'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/026483779400003I
Abstract: 'AbstractThere are plans to double the area of strictly protected tropical forest. This article suggests that the siting and management of such reserves are based on models of conservation inappropriate to developing countries, and that an ignorance of past and present tropical land use will prevent reserves achieving their major objective of conserving useful biodiversity. Strict preservation could also destroy the indigenous knowledge needed for ecosystem management. Multipurpose management and continued human use of tropical forests is a more effective and sustainable conservation policy for tropical developing countries. Rural communities should be actively and physically involved in the future productive management of tropical forests, rather than being induced or pressured into abandoning their forest heritage.'

Title: 'Do community-conserved areas effectively conserve biological diversity? Global insights and the Indian context'
Author: 'Ghazala'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320710001862
Abstract: 'AbstractThe view that biodiversity-rich areas partially or largely managed by local residents, sometimes referred to as community-conserved areas (CCAs), can be effective in biological conservation has gained considerable ground over the past decade. In this paper, we review available scientific information on the conservation effectiveness of such areas globally. We compiled studies undertaken during the last 5\xc2\xa0years (2004\xe2\x80\x932009) that use quantifiable ecological attributes to: (1) compare CCAs with strictly protected areas (SPAs); (2) compare CCAs with open-access ecosystems and (3) study trends in biological attributes of CCAs over time. We found that there were few consistent differences in diversity/species richness of flora or fauna protected under the two types of management or in deforestation rates. However, CCAs tend to harbour a species complement distinct from that of SPAs and show lowered abundances of monitored taxa that are of conservation importance. CCAs conserve biological values more effectively than open-access areas. Also, biological values tend to decline in CCAs over time. We conclude that CCAs could represent a significant improvement over open-access areas in terms of conservation effectiveness, yet fall short of the needs of comprehensive biological conservation. While extremely few studies have been undertaken in India, the trends seen largely concur with global ones. This review, based on a limited sample size, is only a beginning, and is expected to serve as an invitation for further research to address both the question of biological effectiveness of diverse forest governance regimes as well as the socio-economic, demographic and institutional reasons underlying these differences.'

Title: 'Conservation-induced resettlement as a driver of land cover change in India: An object-based trend analysis'
Author: 'Rutherford V.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622816300157
Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2OBIA and trend analysis were used to study resettlement from Rajaji National Park, India.\xe2\x80\xa2People were relocated from riparian/mixed forest areas to grass/brush areas.\xe2\x80\xa2Changes in NDVI were associated with new agricultural land and increased disturbances.\xe2\x80\xa2Resettlement has shifted pressure to less ecologically valuable land cover types outside the park.AbstractLocated in the foothills of the Indian Himalaya, Rajaji National Park was established to protect and enhance the habitat of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and tiger (Panthera tigris). In 2002 the Van Gujjars, indigenous forest pastoralists, were voluntarily resettled from the Chilla Range (an administrative unit of Rajaji National Park) to Gaindikhata, a nearby area where they were granted land for agriculture. In this study we used a variety of remote sensing approaches to identify changes in land cover associated with the resettlement. The methods comprise two main approaches. First, we used object-based image analysis (OBIA) to identify the pre-resettlement land cover classes of use areas (representing agricultural expansion and adjacent areas of grazing, and collection of fuelwood and fodder) and recovery areas (representing areas where settlements were removed, and the adjacent areas of resource use). Secondly, we used trend analysis to assess the gradual and abrupt changes in vegetation that took place in use and recovery areas. To conduct the trend analysis we used BFAST (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend), which separates seasonal variation from long-term trends, and identifies breaks that can be linked back to disturbances or land cover changes. We found that the OBIA classification yielded high average class accuracies, and we were able to make class distinctions that would have been difficult to make using a traditional pixel-based approach. Pre-resettlement, the recovery areas were classified as mixed forest and riparian vegetation. In contrast, the use areas were classified primarily as grass dominated, brush dominated, and plantation forest, and were located relatively far away from riparian areas. Following the resettlement, the trend analysis showed a sudden change in the seasonal variation of NDVI in areas converted to agriculture. Areas neighboring the new agricultural land experienced sudden decreases in NDVI, suggestive of disturbances, at a higher rate than the same land cover types elsewhere. At the same time, these neighboring areas experienced a gradual overall increase in NDVI which could be caused by an expansion of leafy invasive shrubs such as Lantana camara in areas heavily used for biomass collection. The recovery areas also experienced a gradual increase in NDVI as well as sudden breaks to this trend, but we lacked evidence to connect these changes to the resettlement. Our findings support the claim that the resettlement has shifted pressure from more ecologically valuable to less ecologically valuable land cover types, and suggest that to some degree resource use pressure has increased outside the park. The study employs a novel synthesis of OBIA and trend analysis that could be applied to land change studies more broadly.'

Parthenium hysterophorous, Lantana camara, Saccharum spontaneum, Ageratum conyzoides are the weeds that spread all over the world. There are various management practices employed for the control of this weeds. But all of these practices have some drawbacks those are neither environment friendly nor economical. In this paper a review has been done to evaluate various alternative management practices for these terrestrial weeds and to analyze their feasibility.

Title: 'Mangrove vegetation responses to Holocene climate change along Konkan coast of south-western India'
Author: 'Ruta B.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618212000559
Abstract: 'AbstractThe pollen signatures preserved in the mangrove sediments provided records of species variation over a period of time with past climate and sea level changes. The Airoli profile has a Late Pleistocene sequence, and all the other studied profiles and intervals cover the Holocene only. The absence of mangrove signatures during the Late Pleistocene interval is attributed to a relatively low sea level. The ideal conditions for mangrove development along Konkan prevailed during Middle Holocene, when the first extensive mangrove swamps appeared in Sindhudurg (Dhamapur\xe2\x80\x93Hadi) area particularly between 7220 and 4770 yrs BP. This period coincides with the Holocene Climate Optimum (HCO) when Monsoon Asia witnessed much higher precipitation. However, the mangroves responded to environmental changes due to relative abundance of fresh water leading to change in species composition. Two different scenarios of mangrove response during the Late Holocene, one in Dhamapur and the other in Palm Beach, are found to be significant. The Rhizophora\xe2\x80\x93Sonneratia transition from Early Mid-Holocene to Late Holocene is considered to be the most distinctive feature. The decline of mangroves since 3500 yrs BP and further degradation has been attributed to the prevailing arid climate and weakening trends of the monsoon until 1500 yrs BP. However, there seems to be a positive trend in emergence of mangroves in the least disturbed areas of south Konkan, attributed to strengthening of summer monsoon in the recent past.'

Abstract: 'AbstractScholars and advocates increasingly favor rights-based approaches over traditional exclusionary policies in conservation. Yet, national and international conservation policies and programs have often led to the exclusion of forest-dependent peoples. This article proposes and tests the hypothesis that the failures of rights-based approaches in conservation can be attributed in significant measure to the political economic interest of the state in the tropics. To this end, the article presents findings from the empirical analysis of the Forest Rights Act of 2006 in India. Two key recommendations emerge from this analysis. One, the proposals for operationalizing rights-based approaches will likely be far more effective if they protect the inalienability of a minimal set of rights critical to the subsistence and well-being of forest people, as opposed to promising the protection of an expansive set of rights subject to the instrumentality of conservation. Two, the proponents of rights-based approaches in conservation need to guard against their actions reinforcing the institutional status quo of the state control of forests. This, in turn, requires international conservation groups to join hands with national forest rights movements.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Political economic analysis of the proposals for rights-based approaches in conservation. \xe2\x96\xba Identifies state control of natural resources as the key barrier. \xe2\x96\xba Recommends an emphasis on a minimal set of inalienable forest rights. \xe2\x96\xba Recommends conservation groups to join hands with forest rights movements to demand state accountability.'

Title: 'Shifting cultivators in South Asia: Expansion, marginalisation and specialisation over the long term'
Author: 'Eleanor'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618211002989
Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper will consider alternative perspectives on the long-term history of shifting cultivation in India and Sri Lanka. Ethnographic and historical accounts of shifting cultivation, often by groups marginal to centres of urbanism and agrarian civilisation, are reviewed. Shifting cultivation persists in hill regions which are more marginal for sedentary, high intensity agriculture and state procurement of taxation. This can be considered as a strategy both to exploit more marginal lands and to avoid state domination. The origins of this historical equilibrium are hypothesized to lie with the expansion of later Neolithic agriculture (4000\xe2\x80\x933000 BP) and the development of hierarchical polities in the Indian plains in the Iron Age (mainly after 3000 BP). The archaeological record of early agriculture indicates that cultivation precedes sedentary villages, suggesting that shifting cultivation may have been a widespread economic system in the Neolithic, in both the Ganges Valley and the Deccan Plateau of South India. These areas are more suited to sedentary cultivation that could support higher population densities. Therefore, as populations grew in the Neolithic the economic system shifted to sedentary agriculture. The expansion of trade networks, hierarchical societies and demographic density pushed shifting cultivation practices into increasingly marginal settings, where this became an interdependent strategy. Specialist hunter\xe2\x80\x93gatherers trading in forest products became an increasingly important aspect of forest exploitation as did cultivation of \xe2\x80\x98cash crop trees\xe2\x80\x99. The potential to detect the effect of some of these processes in archaeological and palynological evidence is explored.'

A prominent smoke/dust layer is observed between 2 and 4\xc2\xa0km altitude, whereas the CALIPSO observations of the vertical profile of aerosols are in qualitative agreement with the values of MODIS-AOD550\xc2\xa0nm. During the smoke/dust event, a drastic increase (~0.9) in Terra/Aqua MODIS AOD550\xc2\xa0nm is observed. Satellite data indicate a long-range transport of aerosol particles from Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) over large regions. The observed short-wave solar flux at the bottom of the atmosphere (BOA) is found to decrease due to aerosol extinction and was found to be \xe2\x88\x9225 and \xe2\x88\x9216\xc2\xa0Wm\xe2\x88\x922 for the aerosol-laden days and normal days, respectively. In addition, the transport of a widespread forest fire plume is observed across the country as evidenced by the MODIS imagery and HYSPLIT back trajectories.

Abstract: 'AbstractThe term \xe2\x80\x98degraded land\xe2\x80\x99 is subjective and depends on the perspective of the observer. Foresters may view land as degraded when, in the view of the people who \xe2\x80\x98degraded\xe2\x80\x99 it, it has, for the first time, a value. While, for most people the term \xe2\x80\x98degraded land\xe2\x80\x99 unarguably includes land, possibly previously covered in trees, that has been mined and left devoid of all topsoil, all vegetation and any hope of regeneration in the medium term. The term is also held to include land that historically carried trees but which was cleared in the past and having no current alternative use, and has become apparently stable under some form of heath vegetation. In that state it may be valued for other reasons. Degraded land is sometimes held to include previously forested land that is in the process of being changed to other uses but may, currently, still contain remnants of forest. The purpose of this paper is to pose the question as to whether putting trees back on all types of degraded land is always the best decision when factors such as the economics of the operation; the social desirability of the operation and the ecological sustainability of it are considered and to highlight some of the issues a forester needs to consider before embarking on reafforestation of such land. Two examples are used\xe2\x80\x94one from the North Auckland region of New Zealand, the other from the Western Ghats region of India. The New Zealand example shows that both the direct and maintenance costs of afforesting degraded land can be greater than those for afforesting better land and when the private sector is the major player in afforestation, degraded land will not be taken up for planting, however desirable that might be for other reasons. The Indian example demonstrates that land which appears to be degraded might, in fact, be important to someone\xe2\x80\x99s livelihood and the political support for afforestation can be lost unless that implicit right is recognised.'

Abstract: 'AbstractAs a part of the campaign conducted for the spatial characterization of aerosols over peninsular India measurements of aerosol mass loading, optical depth and chemical composition have been carried out during the winter month of February 2004. The aerosol characteristics showed significant variation with locations. The aerosol mass loading as well as the optical depth showed high values along the western coastal regions compared to inland locations. Ions of SO4 and NO3 are observed to be the major anions present over the entire region with higher mass concentrations at the coastal and close-to-forest regions. The mass fraction of non-sea-salt sulphate was larger at the interior locations. Compared to that in the inland/close-to-forest locations the concentration of Cl and Na are found to be 2\xe2\x80\x933 times larger in the coastal region. The mass fraction of non-sea-salt K was largest at locations close to forests. Among the metallic components, Fe, Cu, Ca, Zn, Pb etc, which are of continental origin, are found to dominate over inland locations. These measurements over the land are compared with those observed over the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean during the Indian Ocean Experiment.'

Abstract: 'AbstractAttappady is a rural area in Kerala, South India, that has suffered from severe land degradation and which is inhabited by a poor and predominantly tribal population. The combination of severe land degradation, poverty and a tribal population make Attappady hydrologically and socially unique. Ecological degradation and deforestation followed the gradual building up of land pressure resulting from immigration by more wealthy outsiders. The hills of Attappady were once the forest land of Kerala. Recently it was on the verge of complete degradation.This paper explains how an ecorestoration project involving soil and water conservation interventions, the introduction of agro-forestry, nutritional diversification, income generation activities and training was implemented in a participatory manner. The project had positive impacts on both the environment and the livelihoods of the people living in the watershed, but it also suffered from drawbacks.

Abstract: 'AbstractAs a result of extensive field reconnaissance in southern India, a geographical traverse across the planation surface of the Karnataka uplands, which lie in the rainshadow of the Western Ghats, was selected to assess the consequences of a steep rainfall gradient on soil and landform patterns. The study of the traverse, described in detail, reveals a characteristic progression of soil type and wash divide form from the high-rainfall to the semi-arid end of the continuum and invites a critical reappraisal of classical notions in climatic geomorphology and the soil sciences. The assumption that alternations of wet and dry climates are necessary to achieve planation is given special consideration, and the often held belief that kaolinite minerals are diagnostic of humid palaeoclimates when found in a semi-arid climate is challenged. The findings for the Indian traverse are set against the better known data for West Africa, where the rainfall range between the Gulf of Guinea and the Sahel is comparable with that observed in the south-western Deccan. Differences outweighing similarities, attention is drawn to the possibility that tectonic regime, which also controls the degree of landscape stripping, is a major key to understanding the climatic geography of soils, the tread of planation surfaces and the shape of hillslopes from one region of the Tropics to another.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Biomarker data of Early Eocene petroleum source facies from NE India.\xe2\x80\xa2Oleanane index across section varies due to changes in the extent of diagenesis.\xe2\x80\xa2The tropical rain forest element in eastern India evolved in Early Eocene, similar to the pattern found in western India.AbstractThe biomarkers, molecular fossils of paleobiota, have been studied in detail from a coal-bearing sequence of Early Eocene Lakadong sandstone member of Sylhet Formation of Upper Assam Basin, NE India, using gas chromatography\xe2\x80\x93mass spectrometry. Corresponding hydrocarbon source potential of the same unit has been studied using Rock-Eval pyrolysis. The Rock-Eval data suggest dominant terrestrial land plant contribution, i.e., Type III kerogen and the sediments of the section had entered the early stage of catagenesis. The alkane and isoprenoid distributions are characterized by odd over even preference (OEP) (1.1\xe2\x80\x931.2) of n-alkanes and high pristane/phytane ratio (2.9\xe2\x80\x937.6) which corroborate the Rock-Eval data. The distribution of aliphatic biomarkers is characterized by dominance of C24 tetracyclics over C23 tricyclics, high concentration of des-E hopane, moderate to high C29/C30 hopane ratio, extremely low oleanane index and low C35 homohopane index. The extremely low oleanane index is correlated with a high degree of aromatization of oleanane skeleton, favoured by acidic swampy depositional environment. The presence of diterpanes at the base of the Early Eocene section indicates contribution from gymnosperms (Coniferales order of land plants) whereas angiospermous biomarkers with oleanoid skeleton are also preserved. This pattern subsequently evolved to angiosperm dominated towards the top of the section with no gymnosperm signature indicating possible climatic variation during the Early Eocene. Towards the top of the section presence of bicadinanes indicates contribution of Dipterocarpaceae family of trees and advent of the evergreen tropical rain forest element in eastern India in Early Eocene, similar to the pattern found in western India, e.g., Cambay and Kutch basins.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThere are several contentious issues related to forestry mitigation projects. The special report of the IPCC and literature published so far have shown that permanence, leakage, baseline establishment, measurement, monitoring, etc., could be addressed satisfactorily using existing scientific methods and accounting rules. To understand the methodological issues of developing community forestry projects, a case study was conducted in Mancherial forest division of Adilabad district in Andhra Pradesh, India. This paper addresses: the setting of project boundaries, baseline selection, establishment of additionality and the calculation of carbon sequestration as a result of the project, prior to project implementation. The steps involved in development of the project and the different methods used for establishing baseline, estimating leakage and transaction cost of developing a community forestry project are presented.

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We describe the experiences of ATREE, a non-government environment think tank in India, in implementing its sustainability science programme.\xe2\x80\xa2During its 20 year history, the organization has achieved considerable success in generating interdisciplinary knowledge.\xe2\x80\xa2Despite success, a number of hurdles remain in fostering integration of concepts and approaches across disciplines.\xe2\x80\xa2ATREE's experience offers important insights to the conceptualization and implementation of sustainability science for other organizations.Rapidly accelerating local and global environmental change threatens societal well-being now and in the future in a variety of ways, especially in developing countries. A necessary condition for responding adequately to this environmental crisis is the generation of knowledge that speaks to policy and action, and is holistic, not fragmented along disciplinary lines. The idea of interdisciplinary applied research on the environment has been around since the early 1970s and has taken different institutional forms and labels. In developing countries such as India, the academic community has generally \xe2\x80\x98disciplined\xe2\x80\x99 environmental pedagogy into environmental \xe2\x80\x98science\xe2\x80\x99 programs, and academic research also continues largely on disciplinary lines. We review the experience of the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bangalore, India, that was set up almost two decades ago as an effort to institutionalize an interdisciplinary and problem-oriented research and teaching paradigm. One key element of this effort has been an explicitly normative but broad set of concerns, including equity and democratic governance as integral aspects of conservation and sustainability. Another has been an emphasis on balancing academic rigor with social relevance, the latter achieved not just by speaking to policy makers, but by building collaborations with local communities and activist groups in a number of field sites. Finally, building an explicitly interdisciplinary PhD programme in spite of significant resource and other constraints has built a common perspective. In our analysis, we highlight factors that influence success, including clarity and a common understanding of the mission, human resources, resolution of perennial tensions between disciplinary and interdisciplinary work, commitment to the program structure, program and institutional leadership, and the framework for rewards and incentives. Availability of resources, political support, and the willingness of the state to accept and recognize the work of non-state actors are other major factors. ATREE's experience offers important insights to the conceptualization and implementation of sustainability studies programs elsewhere."

Title: 'Dry season clouds and rainfall in northern Central America: Implications for the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor'
Author: 'Deepak K.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818106001159
Abstract: "AbstractThe proposed Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC) is an ambitious effort to stem the erosion of biodiversity in one of the world's biologically richest regions. The intent is to connect large existing parks and reserves with new protected areas by means of an extensive network of biological corridors within Mesoamerica/Central America to create an environment which provides better prospects for the long-term survival of native species while also addressing the region's socioeconomic needs. While the forest types in northern Central America generally receive some dry season rainfall, in the proposed protected regions, however, it is unclear whether current rainfall has been altered by regional land-use change.Based upon climatological rainfall records at 266 stations in Guatemala and adjacent areas, dry season rainfall in March is markedly lower in deforested areas than in forested areas of the same life zone for each of the widespread life zones. In general, dry season deforested habitats have higher daytime temperatures, are less cloudy, have lower estimated soil moisture and lower values of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) than do forested habitats in the same life zone. The result is hotter and drier air over deforested regions, with lower values of cloud formation and precipitation. Rainfall is predicted from the correlation of raingauge measurements and observed cloud cover; moreover, March rainfall deficiencies >\xc2\xa025\xc2\xa0mm are found for several Holdridge life zones. The data suggest that deforestation is locally intensifying the dry season, increasing the risk of fire, especially for the long corridor connecting regions. In addition, forest regeneration in some parts of the MBC may not result in second-growth forest that is characteristic of that life zone but rather in forest regeneration more typical of drier conditions. The extent to which this would influence the conservation utility of any given corridor depends upon the ecological requirements of the organisms concerned."

Abstract: 'AbstractDetrital dynamics and microbial nutrient flux due to disturbances such as treefall and tree cutting were studied in a subtropical Pinus kesiya Royle Ex. Gordon forest in north-east India. Disturbance has substantially altered community structure, and therefore soil nutrient status. Natural gap formation has not resulted in significant changes in dry matter, C and N accumulation in litter and fine roots, or in microbial nutrient concentrations. However, there was a significant reduction in all functional parameters in the selectively logged site and soil heap. Soil microbial C, N and P were maximum in the understorey and minimun in the heap. Fine roots and microbial biomass contributed more to nutrient recycling in the ecosystem. N-mineralization was generally higher in the disturbed sites.'

Title: 'Opposite trends in response for the Shannon and Simpson indices of landscape diversity'
Author: 'Harini'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622802000024
Abstract: 'AbstractAmong the most popular of metrics used to quantify landscape composition are Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s index, believed to emphasize the richness component of diversity, and Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s index, emphasizing the evenness component. These indices can show considerable variation in response to changes in landscape richness and evenness. However, the possibility of encountering opposite trends in the responses of these indices to assemblages that differ in only a single component of diversity has not been sufficiently acknowledged. An opposite response of these indices was observed for two Indian landscapes with the same richness, differing only in evenness. Using a numerical simulation, the likelihood of encountering landscapes with an opposite response was demonstrated to increase with increasing richness, from about 4% for landscapes consisting of three cover types, to about 6% for ten types. This emphasizes the need for caution when choosing an index of landscape diversity. Rare cover types provide habitats for sensitive species and facilitate critical ecological processes. The Shannon index, sensitive to their presence, is therefore recommended for landscape management within an ecological framework. Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s index, more responsive to the dominant cover type, can be used for specific situations where the dominant cover type is of interest, such as single-species reserve design.'

Title: "Moisture and nutrients determine the distribution and richness of India's large herbivore species assemblage"
Author: 'Farshid S.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179111001046
Abstract: "AbstractThe goal of this study was to test whether body-mass based foraging principles, guided by plant available moisture (PAM) and plant available nutrients (PAN), could explain large mammalian herbivore species distribution and richness in India. We tested (1) whether the occurrence of larger-bodied herbivore species increases with PAM, but is independent of PAN, (2) whether the occurrence of smaller-bodied herbivore species decreases with PAM, but increases with PAN, and (3) whether herbivore species richness is highest in areas with intermediate PAM and high PAN. We analyzed the distribution and richness of the 16 large (>10\xc2\xa0kg) herbivore species found in sub-Himalayan mainland India. Since the distributions of large herbivores in India have been altered by historic human activity, we only used India's largest 76 protected areas as data points, with respect to PAM (log10(rainfall/potential evapotranspiration)), PAN (soil cation exchange capacity), elevation, tree cover, and fire frequency. Using regression and null models to analyze the data, we found positive relations between PAM and the occurrences of the larger-bodied species (elephant and gaur), and negative relations between PAM and the occurrences of smaller-bodied species (chinkara, four-horned antelope and blackbuck). We also found positive relations between the occurrence of the smaller-bodied species and PAN. Large herbivore species richness in India is highest in Kanha and Indravati, areas with high PAN and intermediate PAM. We found that elevation, tree cover and fire frequency were insignificant predictors of herbivore species richness, although elevation and tree cover explained the distribution of a few species. Based on our null model analyses results, we conclude that moisture and soil nutrients are important in determining large herbivore species distribution and richness in sub-Himalayan India.ZusammenfassungDas Ziel dieser Untersuchung war es zu pr\xc3\xbcfen, ob K\xc3\xb6rpergewicht-basierte Prinzipien der Futtersuche, gesteuert durch pflanzenverf\xc3\xbcgbare Feuchtigkeit (PAM) und N\xc3\xa4hrstoffverf\xc3\xbcgbarkeit (PAN), die Verbreitung und den Artenreichtum herbivorer Gro\xc3\x9fs\xc3\xa4uger in Indien erkl\xc3\xa4ren k\xc3\xb6nnen.

Wir analysierten die Verbreitung und den Artenreichtum der 16 gro\xc3\x9fen (>10\xc2\xa0kg) Herbivorenarten, die in der Sub-Himalaya-Region Indiens gefunden werden. Da die Verbreitung der gro\xc3\x9fen Herbivoren in Indien anthropogen beeinflusst wurde, nutzten wir nur die 76 gr\xc3\xb6\xc3\x9ften Schutzgebiete Indiens als Datenpunkte und ber\xc3\xbccksichtigten PAM (log (Niederschlag/potentielle Evapotranspiration)), PAN (Kationenaustauschkapazit\xc3\xa4t des Bodens), H\xc3\xb6he, Kronenbedeckung, und die H\xc3\xa4ufigkeit von Feuern.

The north-east to north-west arc including the foothills of the Himalayas is the primary seats of lightning occurrences. The correlations of lightning activity with each of aerosol loading, vegetation cover, convective instability and convective precipitation helps us in understanding the definite entity that is responsible for changing the lightning activity in different parts of this tropical region. Lightning flash rate (LFR) has significant positive correlations (r ~\xc2\xa00.5\xe2\x80\x930.7) with AOD, CAPE and surface convective precipitation but significant negative correlation (r ~\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa00.4) with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Using global circulation models from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), time-series of observed and projected upper tropospheric water vapor, surface convective precipitation and aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the historical simulations (1996\xe2\x80\x932005) and RCP8.5 emission scenario (2036\xe2\x80\x932045) are analyzed over the Indian region that are vulnerable to climate change in terms of occurrence of convective events and associated hazardous lightning phenomena. This study indicates that upper tropospheric water vapor (300\xc2\xa0hPa) has a significant linkage with the lightning occurrences associated with convective activities and strong updraft. During the mid- 21st century, AOD, surface convective precipitation and specific humidity are projected to increase by 1.42%, 2.01% and 1.40%, respectively which may result in regional changes in lightning activity over the Indian sub-continent.'

Title: 'Interactions between protected areas and their surroundings in human-dominated tropical landscapes'
Author: 'Ruth'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320710000492
Abstract: 'AbstractProtected areas (PAs) often depend on landscapes surrounding them to maintain flows of organisms, water, nutrients, and energy. Park managers have little authority over the surrounding landscape although land use change and infrastructure development can have major impacts on the integrity of a PA. The need for scientifically-based regional-scale land use planning around protected areas is acute in human-dominated landscapes to balance conservation goals with livelihood needs for fuelwood, fodder, and other ecosystem services. As a first step, we propose the designation of a \xe2\x80\x9czone of interaction\xe2\x80\x9d (ZOI) around PAs that encompasses hydrologic, ecological, and socioeconomic interactions between a PA and the surrounding landscape. We illustrate the concept by delineating the ZOI in three Indian PAs \xe2\x80\x93 Kanha, Ranthambore, and Nagarahole \xe2\x80\x93 using remote sensing, population census, and field data. The ZOI in Ranthambore is three times the size of the park and is largely defined by the socioeconomic interactions with surrounding villages. Ranthambore is located in headwaters and wildlife corridors are largely severed. In Nagarahole, the ZOI is more than seven times larger than the park and includes upstream watershed and elephant corridors. Kanha\xe2\x80\x99s ZOI is approximately four times larger than the park and is mostly defined by contiguous surrounding forest. The three examples highlight the differing extents of ZOIs when applying equivalent criteria, even though all are located in densely-populated landscapes. Quantitative understanding of which activities (e.g. collection of forest products, grazing, road construction, tourism development) and which locations within the ZOI are most crucial to conservation goals will enable improved land use planning around PAs in human-dominated landscapes.'

We hypothesize that the lack of trees in grasslands is due to the scarcity of gaps suitable for tree seedling establishment in the grass root layer. We assessed which demographic bottlenecks, seedling recruitment or sapling release, were limiting large tree populations of Acacia species in 229 sites on a gradient from lowland savannas to upland grasslands in eastern South Africa. We explored the frequency of \xe2\x80\x98root gaps\xe2\x80\x99 by quantifying grass root biomass in grids of 18 points at six sites distributed from lowland savannas to upland grasslands.Across the altitudinal gradient, sapling release was the most common bottleneck at low elevation sites switching to seedling recruitment in upland savannas and adjacent grasslands. Root studies showed grass root biomass at upland sites to be double than that of lowland sites. When grass root biomass of all 108 sample points was ranked, lowland savanna sites had the most frequent \xe2\x80\x98gaps\xe2\x80\x99 defined as the lowest percentiles of values (5, 15, 25, 35, 45). The number of \xe2\x80\x98gaps\xe2\x80\x99 decreased along the elevation gradient with none in the grassland site. Dense grass roots may prevent seedling establishment and \xe2\x80\x98root gaps\xe2\x80\x99 may be safe sites with reduced competition where seedlings can establish. We suggest that a lack of root gaps could explain the treeless nature of many upland grasslands.'

They store more than 80% of their produce in their households for consumption. The present study examines the grain storage practices followed by Soligas and the extent of losses incurred by them, in a traditional agricultural setup. In all, 13 different storage structures used by Soligas were recorded. These included both traditional and modern structures. Among these, plastic oven sac was being used most widely, while Thenemane used for storing maize cobs was the least used structure by the Soligas. An evaluation of these storage structures for safe storage of grains revealed that, none of the traditional storage structures were found to be suitable for grain storage, as they had one or the other disadvantages like, not being moisture or insect or rodent proof. However, the modern structures like, the plastic bins were moisture and rodent proof, but they failed to provide protection against insects. Soligas adopted 10 different grain protection methods for safe storage of grains. Despite their use, the presence of insect infestation ranged from 32.14 to 56.41%. Callosobruchus theobromae was the most common stored grain insect found infesting fieldbean (Dolichos bean) that was stored in most of the settlements, while Tribolium castaneum was the rarest, found infesting only split pigeon pea (Cajanus cajana). The extent of grain damage ranged from 10 to 100% in the samples collected.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (211KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Social-ecological and regional adaptation of agrobiodiversity management across a global set of research regions'
Author: 'L.E.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378012000568
Abstract: 'AbstractTo examine management options for biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, eight research regions were classified into social-ecological domains, using a dataset of indicators of livelihood resources, i.e., capital assets. Potential interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture were then compared among landscapes and domains. The approach combined literature review with expert judgment by researchers working in each landscape. Each landscape was described for land use, rural livelihoods and attitudes of social actors toward biodiversity and intensification of agriculture. Principal components analysis of 40 indicators of natural, human, social, financial and physical capital for the eight landscapes showed a loss of biodiversity associated with high-input agricultural intensification. High levels of natural capital (e.g. indicators of wildland biodiversity conservation and agrobiodiversity for human needs) were positively associated with indicators of human capital, including knowledge of the flora and fauna and knowledge sharing among farmers. Three social-ecological domains were identified across the eight landscapes (Tropical Agriculture-Forest Matrix, Tropical Degrading Agroecosystem, and Temperate High-Input Commodity Agriculture) using hierarchical clustering of the indicator values. Each domain shared a set of interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture and ecological intensification that could also increase food security in the impoverished landscapes. Implementation of interventions differed greatly among the landscapes, e.g. financial capital for new farming practices in the Intensive Agriculture domain vs. developing market value chains in the other domains. This exploratory study suggests that indicators of knowledge systems should receive greater emphasis in the monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and that inventories of assets at the landscape level can inform adaptive management of agrobiodiversity-based interventions.Graphical abstractDownload full-size imageHighlights\xe2\x96\xba Biodiversity supports the ecological intensification of agriculture. \xe2\x96\xba Agricultural landscapes can be monitored in terms of livelihood resources (capital assets). \xe2\x96\xba Natural capital is associated with local knowledge systems, not financial capital. \xe2\x96\xba Biodiversity-based interventions can be targeted for different social-ecological domains. \xe2\x96\xba Ecological intensification is knowledge-intensive and context-specific.'

Abstract: 'AbstractLandscape ecology has brought spatial analysis and geospatial modeling to the forefront of ecological research. In this study, we investigated changes in landscape structure and the ecological consequences of urbanization in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area using spatial indices, change analysis, and geospatial modeling. Major land transformation patterns from 1975 to 2006 were mapped using multi-temporal classification maps. Landscape metrics for 1975, 1986, 1998, and 2006 were calculated and analyzed using Patch Analyst. The deforestation process due to urbanization in the future was modeled using GEOMOD within the framework of 2030 regional land use planning. Results reveal urban area expanded 82% from 1975 to 2006, mainly by displacing forest and agricultural lands by in-filling gaps within the urban area or near its periphery. Leap-frog development was noticeably absent. Many small patches of forest and agriculture located within or near the urban and suburban areas were replaced directly by urban land uses. Urbanization has become ecologically complicated but geometrically simpler whereas the rural landscape became less abundant and diverse. We predict: (1) forest cover will continue to decrease consistently due to on-going urbanization process; and (2) the pattern of deforestation will occur within the urban area due to in-filling and along its periphery as the urban area expands outward into undeveloped areas.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Landscape structure and dynamics were evaluated using landscape indices and GEOMOD. \xe2\x96\xba Large amount of agriculture and forest land were converted to urban land uses since 1975. \xe2\x96\xba Urban in-filling pattern rather than leap-frog development was revealed. \xe2\x96\xba Urban expansion resulted in a geometrically simpler but more complicated urban landscape. \xe2\x96\xba Rural landscape is becoming less abundant with a decrease in the extended ecotones.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe relocation and resettlement of people from nature reserves is a controversial issue in the conservation community. The perceived poor success rate of resettlement efforts, combined with availability of few well-documented studies, warrants a detailed examination of this issue. I have analyzed a relocation and resettlement project in India\xe2\x80\x99s Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary. I examine the relocation experience of 419 households who moved to two villages located outside the reserve. I interviewed 61% of relocated households in 2002 and 55% relocated households in 2006. In 2002, 71% of households were satisfied with the relocation effort and their quality of life. In 2006, 52% of households were satisfied with their quality of life. Four years after relocation, all households have access to electricity, water, schools, health care, transportation, and communication facilities. Many households have increased their income and assets. Yet, there were differences between the two different-resettlement villages, with one of them faring better in terms of economics, hardships, and uncertainty.

Abstract: 'AbstractSaraca asoca (Fabaceae) is a prime ingredient in Asokarishta, a well-known Ayurvedic preparation for gynecological ailments. Due to scarcity, adulteration or substitution of related raw drugs is a common practice in its preparation. The bark of Kingiodendron pinnatum (Roxb. ex DC.) Harms, morphologically similar to S.\xc2\xa0asoca (Asoka) is a widely used substitute. The present study aimed to evaluate the pharmacological effectiveness of K.\xc2\xa0pinnatum as an alternative for S.\xc2\xa0asoca in Asokarishta by determining the inhibitory effect of estrogen induced uterus endometrial thickening in immature female rats. Arishta was prepared using S.\xc2\xa0asoca and with the substitute, K.\xc2\xa0pinnatum as per Ayurvedic Pharmacopeia. Uterus endometrial thickening was induced by the administration of estradiol (20\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/kg b. wt, i.p) to 8-day-old rats for 5 alternate days. On day 16, following estradiol administration, the serum estrogen level was found elevated to 156.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa08\xc2\xa0pg/ml from the normal value 32.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0pg/ml and consequently increased the thickness of uterus endometrium from 16.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.4 to 75.2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa015.3\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm. Upon oral administration of 400\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcl/kg b. wt Asokarishta (ASA) and Arishta made with K.\xc2\xa0pinnatum (AKP), the thickening was reduced to 42.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa012.7 and 47.1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa010.5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm and the estrogen level diminished to 102.6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa010 and 97.3\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa08\xc2\xa0pg/ml, respectively. Arishta also reduced the chronic/acute inflammations in mice and improved the antioxidant status of rats. No toxic symptom was observed in the animals by the treatment of Arishta. The study supports the use of K.\xc2\xa0pinnatum as an alternative to S.\xc2\xa0asoca in Asokarishta and gives a scientific validation for Asokarishta in gynecological ailments.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (343KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'In searching for different patterns of practice, lifestyle, and environment supportive of optimal health, we look to our elders around the world, who in the wisdom that has sustained them, we learn from with careful attention. Thirty-seven elders who live by their traditions participated in the present study. They assisted in the refinement of the methodology and collections and preparation of these data. These participants are well-respected, representative elders and traditional healers of their regions. These data, from study sites of the Eastern Afromontane and Albertine Rift region of Ethiopia, Africa; the Maya Mountains region of Belize, Central America; the Western Ghats region of India; and the Appalachian Mountains region of the United States, were grouped into three major categories: (1) philosophy, attitudes, and outlook, (2) lifestyle practices, and (3) dietary and nutritional practices. These elders demonstrate a relatively comprehensive but simple set of practices that can enhance our vitality and promote longevity sustainably. In essence, these practices, or practice wisdom, of our longest living elders, promote propagation of healthful lifestyles by following traditional ways and taking care of body, mind, spirit and our environment. Further field research among a larger cohort is required to fully generalize the findings of this study, but much of it is consistent with what we already know should be done. These data begin illustration of practice wisdom for implementation and serve to engage our universities, our hospitals, our industries, and our students, who we must position toward social change.'

Abstract: 'SummaryThis study in the Hariyali sacred landscape (Garhwal Himalaya, India) was undertaken to evaluate the impact of ecosystem type, quality of organic inputs and water management on diversity and abundance of earthworms. A total of seven species viz., moniligastrid Drawida nepalensis (Michaelsen), lumbricid Allolobophora parva (Eisen), megascolecid Eutyphoeus sp. (near Eutyphoeus pharpingianus), octochaetid Octochaetona beatrix (Beddard), megascolecid Periyonx sp., octochaetid Lennogaster pusillus (Stephenson) and megascolecid Amynthas corticis (Baird), belonging to four families were found in the landscape. D. nepalensis had the widest distribution. Eutyphoeus sp., A. parva and Periyonx sp. were found only in forest ecosystems and L. pusillus and A. corticis only in agroecosystems. Total density of earthworms was highest under pine forest and species richness was greatest under the broad-leaved forest. Density and biomass of D. nepalensis and L. pusillus varied significantly between different years of cropping under rainfed agriculture receiving oak based or pine based organic inputs. Forest ecosystems had a mixed population of endemic and exotic species, whereas in agroecosystems endemics dominated. Epigeic species were the dominant functional group under broad-leaved forest and pine \xe2\x80\x93 broad-leaved mixed forests, whilst endogeic species were dominant under the pine forest. Irrigated agroecosystems receiving oak-based as well as pine-based organic inputs supported only endogeics, whereas both endogeic and epi-anecic species were observed in rainfed agroecosystems. This suggests that distribution of functional groups is determined by land use practices. Eutyphoeus sp. was the only species that showed a significant positive correlation with moisture and a negative correlation with pH and organic carbon. D. nepalensis and A. parva occurred under forest ecosystems and showed a significant positive correlation with lignin and C/N ratio, and a negative correlation with litter polyphenol concentration. Soil parameters and FYM-characteristics did not show any significant correlation with species occurring under agroecosystems. D. nepalensis, which is an endogeic but with a wide ecological amplitude, and the epigeic A. parva, present in large numbers in pine forest, are the two species which could be promoted for inoculation into litter-FYM based organic residue management pits.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2To conserve the tiger it is critical to enable the persistence of the species across larger landscapes.\xe2\x80\xa2Establishing protected areas for tiger recovery remains one of the means of landscape approach.\xe2\x80\xa2While the gazetting of protected areas is necessary to enable this, it is not sufficient.\xe2\x80\xa2It is essential to benchmark and monitor the process that enable the recovery of tigers.AbstractTo conserve a large, wide-ranging carnivore like the tiger, it is critical not only to maintain populations at key habitat sites, but also to enable the persistence of the species across much larger landscapes. To do this, it is important to establish well-linked habitat networks where sites for survival and reproduction of tigers are complemented by opportunities for dispersal and colonization. On the ground, expanding protection to areas with a potential for tiger recovery still remains the means of operationalizing the landscape approach. Yet, while the gazetting of protected areas is necessary to enable this, it is not sufficient. It is essential to benchmark and monitor the process by which establishment of protected areas must necessarily be followed by management changes that enable a recovery of tigers, their prey and their habitats. In this paper, we report a case study from the Cauvery and Malai Mahadeshwara Hills Wildlife Sanctuaries of southern India, where we document the infrastructural and institutional changes that ensued after an unprecedented expansion of protected areas in this landscape. Further, we establish ecological benchmarks of the abundance and distribution of tigers, the relative abundance of their prey, and the status of their habitats, against which the recovery of tigers in this area of vast conservation potential may be assessed over time.'

Abstract: 'AbstractBackgroundKodagu is one of the tiniest districts in the Southern part of Karnataka (India). It is a habitat for more than ten different types of ethnic groups commonly called \xe2\x80\x98Girijana\xe2\x80\x99. An ethnomedicinal survey was undertaken in the tribal areas of the district to collect information from the traditional herbal healers on the use of medicinal plants in order to evaluate the potential medicinal uses of local plants used in curing various ailments.MethodsThe information was collected through conducting interviews, discussion and field observation with herbal healers and knowledgeable elder people of the study area using semi-structured questionnaire.ResultsThe survey reveals that the tribal people even today rely on traditional practice-knowledge inherited from generation to generation. It is evident that about 126 plant species belonging to 60 families are being used as ethnic drugs to cure various ailments viz., diabetes (32), skin disorder (22), diarrhoea (6), wound healing (17), intestinal worm (14), antidote for snake bite (13), jaundice (8) etc., respectively.ConclusionRecent trend shows a decline in the number of traditional herbal healers in the tribal areas since the younger generation is not interested to continue this tradition. Hence, there is an urgent need to record and preserve all information on plants used by different ethnic/tribal communities for various purposes before it is completely lost. In addition, several wild medicinal plants are declining in number due to deforestation and forest fires. There is need for phytochemical analysis and pharmacological investigations of these important disappearing plants to strengthen the documentation of ethnic drugs. It would help in developing novel drug(s) to treat chronic diseases.'

Observations of CCN spectra during clean, polluted and highly polluted conditions indicated significant differences between airborne and ground observations. Vertical variation of CCN concentration is illustrated from airborne observations in the clean, polluted and highly polluted conditions with different air mass characteristics. The cloud base CCN number concentrations are three times less than that of the surface measurements at different supersaturations. Diurnal variations of the ground based CCN number concentration and activation diameter showed bimodality. Atmospheric mixing in the wet conditions is mainly through mechanical mixing. The dry conditions favored convective mixing and were dominated by more CCN than the wet conditions. New particle formation and growth events have been observed and were found more often on days with convective mixing. The average critical activation diameter (at 0.6% SS) observed at the ground is approximately 60\xc2\xa0nm and availability of a large number of particles below this limit was due to the new particle formation. Observations give convincing evidence that the precipitable water and liquid water path is inversely proportional to surface CCN number concentration, and this relationship is largely dictated by the meteorological conditions.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe conservation challenges facing mega-biodiverse South and Southeast Asia in the 21st century are enormous. For millennia, much of the habitat of these regions was only lightly modified by human endeavour, yet now it is experiencing rampant deforestation, logging, biofuel cropping, invasive species expansion, and the synergies of climate change, drought, fire and sea-level rise. Although small-scale conservation management might assist some species and habitats, the broader sweep of problems requires big thinking and some radical solutions. Given the long expected lead times between progressive economic development and stabilization of human population size and consumption rates, we argue that \xe2\x80\x98technological fixes\xe2\x80\x99 cannot be ignored if we are to address social and fiscal drivers of environmental degradation and associated species extinctions in rapidly developing regions like southern Asia.

Abstract: 'AbstractEthnopharmacological relevanceMore than 15,000 angiosperm species are dioecious, i.e., having distinct male and female individual plants. The allocation of resources between male and female plants is different, and also variation in secondary metabolites and sex-biased herbivory is reported among dioecious plants. However, little is known about the ethnobotany of dioecious species and whether preferences exist for a specific gender, e.g., in food, medicine or timber.Aim of the studyThe aim of this study was: 1) to study whether Indian folk healers have preference for plant genders, and to document their knowledge and use of dioecious species; 2) to understand the concept of plant gender in Indian systems of medicine and folk medicine, and whether Ayurvedic literature includes any references to gender preference.Materials and methodsLists of dioecious plants used in Indian systems of medicine and folk medicine were compiled. Ethnobotanical data was collected on perceptions and awareness of dioecious plants, and preferences of use for specific genders of dioecious species using semi-structured interviews with folk healers in Tamil Nadu, India. In addition, twenty Ayurvedic doctors were interviewed to gain insight into the concept of plant gender in Ayurveda.ResultsIndian systems of medicine contain 5\xe2\x80\x937% dioecious species, and this estimate is congruent with the number of dioecious species in flowering plants in general. Informants recognized the phenomenon of dioecy in 31 out of 40 species, and reported gender preferences for 13 species with respect to uses as timber, food and medicine. Among informants different plant traits such as plant size, fruit size, and visibility of fruits determines the perception of a plant being a male or female. Ayurvedic classical literature provides no straightforward evidence on gender preferences in preparation of medicines or treatment of illness, however it contains details about reproductive morphology and sexual differentiation of plants.ConclusionsA knowledge gap exists in ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological literature on traditional knowledge of dioecious plants. From this explorative study it is evident that people have traditional knowledge on plant gender and preferential usages towards one gender. Based on this, we propose that researchers conducting ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological studies should consider documenting traditional knowledge on sexual systems of plants, and test the existence of gender specific usages in their conceptual framework and hypothesis testing. Incorporating such concepts could provide new dimensions of scientific knowledge with potential implications to conservation biology, chemical ecology, ethnoecology and drug discovery.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (250KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Research paperModelling the chemical weathering fluxes at the watershed scale in the Tropics (Mule Hole, South India): Relative contribution of the smectite/kaolinite assemblage versus primary minerals'
Author: 'Aur\xc3\xa9lie'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254110002597
Abstract: 'AbstractWe investigate the chemical weathering processes and fluxes in a small experimental watershed (SEW) through a modelling approach. The study site is the Mule Hole SEW developed on a gneissic basement located in the climatic gradient of the Western Ghats, South India. The model couples a lumped hydrological model simulating the water budget at the watershed scale to the WITCH model estimating the dissolution/precipitation rates of minerals using laboratory kinetic laws. Forcing functions and parameters of the simulation are defined by the field data. The coupled model is calibrated with stream and groundwater compositions through the testing of a large range of smectite solubility and abundance in the soil horizons. We found that, despite the low abundance of smectite in the dominant soil type of the watershed (4\xc2\xa0vol.%), their net dissolution provides 75% of the export of dissolved silica, while primary silicate mineral dissolution releases only 15% of this flux. Overall, smectites (modelled as montmorillonites) are not stable under the present day climatic conditions. Furthermore, the dissolution of trace carbonates in the saprolitic horizon provides 50% of the calcium export at the watershed scale. Modelling results show the contrasted behavior of the two main soil types of the watershed: red soils (88% of the surface) are provider of calcium, while black soils (smectite-rich and characterized by a lower drainage) consumes calcium through overall carbonate precipitation. Our model results stress the key role played by minor/accessory minerals and by the thermodynamic properties of smectite minerals, and by the drainage of the weathering profiles on the weathering budget of a tropical watershed.Research Highlights\xe2\x96\xba The weathering mass balance at the watershed scale is very sensitive to the chosen solubility of smectite. \xe2\x96\xba Smectites (4\xc2\xa0vol.%) and calcite (trace) are not stable under present day climatic conditions and control the weathering budget of the watershed. \xe2\x96\xba Soil drainage appears to be a critical parameter controlling the net budget of chemical weathering. \xe2\x96\xba The weathering processes appear to be out of steady state.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We model the interaction between habitat loss and climate.\xe2\x80\xa2We quantify the implications for biodiversity loss and conservation priorities.\xe2\x80\xa2We show that the interaction increases impacts on birds and mammals by up to 43%.\xe2\x80\xa2The ranking of biodiversity hotspots by threat depends critically on the interaction.AbstractClimate change and land-cover change will have major impacts on biodiversity persistence worldwide. These two stressors are likely to interact, but how climate change will mediate the effects of land-cover change remains poorly understood. Here we use an empirically-derived model of the interaction between habitat loss and climate to predict the implications of this for biodiversity loss and conservation priorities at a global scale. Risk analysis was used to estimate the risk of biodiversity loss due to alternative future land-cover change scenarios and to quantify how climate change mediates this risk. We demonstrate that the interaction of climate change with land-cover change could increase the impact of land-cover change on birds and mammals by up to 43% and 24% respectively and alter the spatial distribution of threats. Additionally, we show that the ranking of global biodiversity hotspots by threat depends critically on the interaction between climate change and habitat loss. Our study suggests that the investment of conservation resources will likely change once the interaction between climate change and land-cover change is taken into account. We argue that global conservation efforts must take this into account if we are to develop cost-effective conservation policies and strategies under global change.'

Author: 'Krithi K.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320710000509
Abstract: 'AbstractGlobal and regional species conservation efforts are hindered by poor distribution data and range maps. Many Indian primates face extinction, but assessments of population status are hindered by lack of reliable distribution data. We estimated the current occurrence and distribution of 15 Indian primates by applying occupancy models to field data from a country-wide survey of local experts. We modeled species occurrence in relation to ecological and social covariates (protected areas, landscape characteristics, and human influences), which we believe are critical to determining species occurrence in India. We found evidence that protected areas positively influence occurrence of seven species and for some species are their only refuge. We found evergreen forests to be more critical for some primates along with temperate and deciduous forests. Elevation negatively influenced occurrence of three species. Lower human population density was positively associated with occurrence of five species, and higher cultural tolerance was positively associated with occurrence of three species. We find that 11 primates occupy less than 15% of the total land area of India. Vulnerable primates with restricted ranges are Golden langur, Arunachal macaque, Pig-tailed macaque, stump-tailed macaque, Phayre\xe2\x80\x99s leaf monkey, Nilgiri langur and Lion-tailed macaque. Only Hanuman langur and rhesus macaque are widely distributed. We find occupancy modeling to be useful in determining species ranges, and in agreement with current species ranking and IUCN status. In landscapes where monitoring efforts require optimizing cost, effort and time, we used ecological and social covariates to reliably estimate species occurrence and focus species conservation efforts.'

Title: 'Validation of Geospatial model for Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level\xe2\x80\x94a study in Andaman & Nicobar Islands, India'

Abstract: "AbstractThe present paper deals with Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level, preparing thematic maps for spatial representation of landscape parameters and then validation of the geospatial model using a three-tier approach, viz., landscape analysis, field data extrapolation and geospatial analysis, for two groups of islands in Indian subcontinent. On-screen visual interpretation approach based on IRS LISS-III and Landsat TM data sets was used to delineate the vegetation communities. Field survey attributes on species diversity, economical/medicinal uses and endemism were suitably linked with satellite image-derived landscape attributes in a geospatial domain. The landscape parameters, viz., fragmentation and disturbance index, clearly indicate that Nicobar Islands are less disturbed compared to Andaman. The phytosociological data of different vegetation types collected from 544 stratified sample points was recorded with ground coordinates. The plant communities of Andaman show high plant diversity in terms of number of species (523 species) and more heterogeneity compared to those of Nicobar (347 species). Biological richness was estimated as a function of six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical and ecological) to stratify forest vegetation in two phytogeographically distinct groups of tropical islands, viz., Andaman and Nicobar, using a customized software, SPLAM.Validation of ecological indices had always been a major challenge for ecologist. Here, we discuss a validation technique using field-driven species regression equations for fragmentation (FR), disturbance (DI) and biological richness (BR) indices and propose improvements in the biological richness methodology. The research question of establishment of linkages between expressions of diversity at different scales is sought and thereby validating the existing model outputs has been proposed. The sensitivity of in-field measurements with landscape parameters has been explicitly analyzed. During validation, the species richness, diversity and mean basal area have shown slow decrease with sudden rise in intermediate levels followed by a steep decline at increasing levels of fragmentation and disturbance. The empirically derived regression coefficient has significant correspondence (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) in terms of community response in both island's groups. The vegetation communities in the forested landscape possess significant linkages with landscape scale processes, viz., FR and DI, as evident by the degree of correlation. The heterogeneity measured as diversity in habit group shows community dimensions in different spatial zones. The generation of baseline data on community ecology allows prioritization of planning process and evolves specific management practices. It may be concluded that the improved biodiversity assessment model and the designed validation techniques have enhanced the reliability of model thus widened the scope for its application in the rapid biodiversity assessment."

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper presents the results of a sustainability analysis carried out for the evaluation of two participatory watershed projects in Kerala, South India. For a watershed project to be sustainable, four groups of criteria should be considered related to natural resources, technology, institutions and economics, respectively. Poor performance in each of these groups can jeopardise sustainability. The process is as strong as the weakest shackle in the chain. For a watershed project to be sustainable, all these groups should perform above a minimum standard. In both projects studied, the weakest shackle in the sustainability chain appears to be the economic sustainability of the projects. If one element fails, sustainability cannot be achieved.'

Abstract: 'AbstractBiodiversity surveys were conducted in 13, 10\xc3\x9750 m2 plots located between 1400 to 3700 m above mean sea level in a range of habitats in temperate mixed Oak and Coniferous forests through sub-alpine to the alpine grasslands in Chamoli district of Uttaranchal state in the Indian Garhwal Himalaya. Cross-taxon congruence in biodiversity (\xce\xb1-diversity and \xce\xb2-diversity) across macrolichens, mosses, liverworts, woody plants (shrubs and trees) and ants was investigated, so as to examine the extent to which these groups of organisms can function as surrogates for each other. Although woody plants provided a major substrate for macrolichens and mosses, there was no species-specific association between them. Woody plant species richness was highly positively correlated with mosses (r2=0.63, P<0.001), but the relationship was not particularly very strong with lichens and liverworts. While there was a significant correlation in the species turnover (\xce\xb2-diversity) of macrolichens with mosses (r2=0.21, P<0.005), the relationship was relatively poor with the woody plants. On the other hand, negative correlations emerged in the species richness of ants with those of macrolichens, mosses and woody plants (r2=\xe2\x88\x920.44, P<0.05), but most of the complementarity (turnover) relationships among them were positive. Since diversity between taxonomic hierarchies within the group was consistently significantly positively correlated in all these taxa, the higher taxonomic categories such as genus and family may be employed as surrogates for rapid assessment and monitoring of species diversity. Although no single group other than macrolichens has emerged as a good indicator of changes in species richness in all other groups, some concordant relationships between them conform to the hypothesis that species assemblages of certain taxonomic groups could still be used as surrogates for efficient monitoring of species diversity in other groups whose distribution may further predict the importance of conserving overall biodiversity in landscapes such as the Garhwal Himalaya.'

Title: 'Mineral magnetic and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy characteristics of the Deccan volcanic bole beds: Implications to genesis and transformations of iron oxides'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The iron oxide characteristics of different color (i.e. red, brown and green) interflow sediments/boles of DVP are studied.\xe2\x80\xa2The magnetic and DRS study show variable concentration of hematite, goethite and maghemite in different color bole beds.\xe2\x80\xa2The variable concentration of iron oxides in various color boles is due to differential heating and pedogenic environment.\xe2\x80\xa2Iron oxide transformation pathways in boles speculate a great scope of study as analogue to heated Martian soil/sediments.AbstractDeccan volcanic bole beds are important indicators of paleoenvironmental conditions during Cretaceous\xe2\x80\x93Tertiary volcanism. However, little attention has been paid to iron oxide characteristics of these lava flow hosted sediments. Therefore, in order to understand the genesis and transformation of various iron oxides in different colored bole beds, we studied the mineral magnetism and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) characteristics of red, brown and green boles that are extensively exposed in the Deccan volcanic province (DVP) of Western India. Mineral magnetism and DRS characteristics indicate hematite (\xce\xb1-Fe2O3) as the major iron oxide in all the bole beds with traces of goethite (\xce\xb1-FeOOH) in many. Maghemite (\xce\xb3-Fe2O3) was also present in red boles as well as in few brown and green boles. The higher concentration of magnetic minerals in red boles is due to the neo-formation of fine magnetic minerals produced from heating of the weathered sediments by the overlying lava flow. The increasing concentration of superparamagnetic (SP) fraction (indicated by frequency dependent susceptibility, \xcf\x87fd) with increased reddening of the bole beds (mean \xcf\x87fd for green, brown and red boles\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0~\xc2\xa02.5, 11.1 and 19.3\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa010\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa08\xc2\xa0m3\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01, respectively) facilitates the use of \xcf\x87fd as first order estimate for degree of heating in red boles. The paragenesis of ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic minerals in green and brown boles is indicated by good correlation (R2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.78) between hard isothermal remanent magnetization (HIRM) and \xcf\x87fd suggests that green and brown boles have undergone some pedogenesis. The overall distribution of iron oxides in these bole beds indicate their genesis from incipient weathering of Fe\xe2\x80\x93Mg minerals (e.g. olivine and pyroxenes) under humid conditions leading to the formation of ferrihydrite and goethite as precursors. Partial to complete heating resulted into oxidation of precursors and titanomagnetite to maghemite as the intermediate transformation phase and hematite as end product. The green, brown and red boles thus represent the transitional baking environments under various hydrous\xe2\x80\x93anhydrous conditions and pedogenic processes. The genesis and transformation of various iron oxides in DVP bole beds may have significant implications for the characterization of such interflow sediments/paleosols from other igneous provinces (e.g. Israel, Karoo Flood Basalt, South Africa and Columbia River Basalt, USA). Further, complex genesis of the iron oxides in the DVP bole beds also envisages a great scope to study them as Martian analogues apart from their significance to paleoenvironment and demands more advanced rock magnetic and spectroscopic approaches.'

The parameters considered for characterization are: liquid water content (LWC), cloud vertical motion (updraft, downdraft: w), cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) and effective radius (Re). The results are based on 15 research flights which were conducted from the base station Hyderabad during summer monsoon season. The clouds studied were developing congestus. The clouds have low CDNC and low updraft values resembling the oceanic convective clouds. The super-saturation in clouds is found to be low (\xe2\x89\xa40.2%) due to low updrafts. The land surface behaves like ocean surface during monsoon as deduced from Bowen ratio. Microphysically the clouds showed oceanic characteristics. However, these clouds yield low rainfall due to their low efficiency (mean 14%). The cloud parameters showed a large variability; hence their characteristic values are reported in terms of median values. These values will serve the numerical models for rainfall simulations over the region and also will be useful as a scientific basis for cloud seeding operations to increase the rainfall efficiency. The study revealed that monsoon convective clouds over the rain-shadow region are of oceanic type over the gray land, and therefore we christen them as \xe2\x80\x9cGray Ocean\xe2\x80\x9d clouds.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Aerosol vertical and spatial distribution in monsoon environment over Indian sub continent.\xe2\x80\xa2Dominance of fine and coarse mode aerosol and strong vertical gradient during monsoon.\xe2\x80\xa2Surface level concentration and height of ABL influence the aerosol optical depth.AbstractThe variability in aerosol vertical and spatial distribution over the continental Indian region is studied using the airborne observations during the Cloud Aerosol Interactions and Precipitation Enhancement EXperiment (CAIPEEX) from May to September, 2009. The fine mode (0.1\xe2\x80\x933.0\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm) aerosol vertical profiles up to 6\xc2\xa0km at different regions showed different vertical structures mostly influenced by the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) depth as well as the origin of air mass trajectories and the presence of clouds. Elevated aerosol layers are observed during pre-monsoon and during monsoon at some locations but comparatively lower than the one observed in the boundary layer. During monsoon, aerosol number concentration showed strong vertical gradient and a transition is observed between the boundary layer and the free troposphere. The coarse mode (>3\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm) aerosol vertical profiles also showed elevated layers at higher altitudes due to the incursion of dry air laddened with dust. The spatial distribution shows significant variation at the elevated layers as compared to that in the boundary layer during pre-monsoon, while high variability is observed in the boundary layer during monsoon. The frequency distribution of different aerosol types from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) showed dominating contributions from dust, polluted dust and smoke during pre-monsoon. During monsoon also traces of these pollutants were found to be high as the year 2009 is a drought year with rainfall deficiency of 22%. The surface level number concentration and the height of ABL are found to influence the aerosol optical depths significantly.'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Monsoon was stronger during 3100\xe2\x80\x932500\xc2\xa0cal.\xc2\xa0years\xc2\xa0B.P. compared to the present.\xe2\x80\xa2Monsoon was weaker during 2500\xe2\x80\x931000\xc2\xa0cal.\xc2\xa0years\xc2\xa0B.P., which strengthened thereafter.\xe2\x80\xa2Rainfall was high during the Medieval Warm Period and low during the Little Ice Age.\xe2\x80\xa2The monsoon in the region is influenced by solar activity.\xe2\x80\xa2Regional trends in monsoon during the Late Holocene are broadly similar.AbstractSediments from Pookot Lake (PK) in southern India have provided a record of local environmental changes and catchment processes during the past 3100\xc2\xa0cal.\xc2\xa0years\xc2\xa0B.P. Variations in the rock magnetic parameters (\xcf\x87lf, \xcf\x87fd, \xcf\x87ARM and IRM's at different field strengths) of sediments from two AMS 14C-dated cores reflect climate-induced changes in the catchment of Pookot Lake. Assuming that rainfall is most likely the dominant driving mechanism behind the rock magnetic variations of PK sediments, the environmental history of the site has been reconstructed. Rock magnetic parameters exhibit significant variations during the past 3100\xc2\xa0years. The palaeoenvironmental history of the Pookot Lake region may be divided into three phases. During the first phase (~\xc2\xa03100 to 2500\xc2\xa0cal.\xc2\xa0years\xc2\xa0B.P.), catchment erosion and detrital influx were high, indicating a strong monsoon. The second phase, which lasted from 2500 to 1000\xc2\xa0cal.\xc2\xa0years\xc2\xa0B.P., was characterised by low and steady rainfall, resulting in a low and uniform catchment erosion and detrital influx. Phase 2 was interspersed with brief intervals of strong monsoon and characterised by frequent drying up of the lake. During Phase 3 (~\xc2\xa01000\xc2\xa0cal.\xc2\xa0years\xc2\xa0B.P. to the present), catchment erosion was high, indicating a shift to strong monsoonal conditions. It appears that monsoonal rainfall in the region is influenced by solar activity, with periods of high total solar irradiance being characterised by high rainfall and vice versa; it was relatively low during the Little Ice Age and high during the Medieval Warm Period. The magnetic susceptibility (\xcf\x87lf) data exhibit a number of periodicities which might have a solar origin. The \xcf\x87lf record exhibits similarities with other continental and marine palaeoclimatic records from the region, indicating that regional trends in the monsoon during the Late Holocene are broadly similar."

Title: 'History of vegetation and habitat change in the Austral-Asian region'

Abstract: 'AbstractOver 1000 marine and terrestrial pollen diagrams and some hundreds of vertebrate faunal sequences have been studied in the Austral-Asian region bisected by the PEPII transect, from the Russian arctic extending south through east Asia, Indochina, southern Asia, insular Southeast Asia (Sunda), Melanesia, Australasia (Sahul) and the western south Pacific. The majority of these records are Holocene but sufficient data exist to allow the reconstruction of the changing biomes over at least the past 200,000 years. The PEPII transect is free of the effects of large northern ice caps yet exhibits vegetational change in glacial cycles of a similar scale to North America. Major processes that can be discerned are the response of tropical forests in both lowlands and uplands to glacial cycles, the expansion of humid vegetation at the Pleistocene\xe2\x80\x93Holocene transition and the change in faunal and vegetational controls as humans occupy the region. There is evidence for major changes in the intensity of monsoon and El Nino-Southern oscillation variability both on glacial\xe2\x80\x93interglacial and longer time scales with much of the region experiencing a long-term trend towards more variable and/or drier climatic conditions. Temperature variation is most marked in high latitudes and high altitudes with precipitation providing the major climate control in lower latitude, lowland areas. At least some boundary shifts may be the response of vegetation to changing CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Numerous questions of detail remain, however, and current resolution is too coarse to examine the degree of synchroneity of millennial scale change along the transect.'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Macrofauna varies with organic matter quality and soil depth in mountain agroecosystems.\xe2\x80\xa2Macrofauna contributes to higher decomposition of leaf litter than defaunated control plots.\xe2\x80\xa2Macrofauna excluded soil has low available nutrients than defaunated control plots.AbstractIn agroecosystems, rich soil biodiversity performs a variety of ecological services and contributes to sustainability of agriculture. In spite of the vast knowledge on this subject globally, the Himalayan mountain agroecosystems remain almost unexplored, and the agriculture is practiced on a subsistence level in the desire of suitable soil fertility management practices. This study was conducted on the soil macrofauna community and its influence on litter decomposition, nutrient release and soil quality in rainfed wheat-paddy cropping systems in two major agroecosystems in the central Himalayan mountains. Following local farmers' practice, Oak leaf litter (agroecosystem-I) and Pine forests leaf litter (agroecosystem-II) were used for farm yard manure (FYM) preparation for soil fertility restoration. Control (traditional cropfields) and treatment (macrofauna excluded plots) were maintained in this study. In both the agroecosystems, 11 soil macrofauna groups were recorded across 0\xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xa0cm soil depths over an annual crop cycle. Total macrofauna density in the rhizosphere zone of agroecosystem-I was significantly greater (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01) than in agroecosystem-II (2477 vs. 2241\xc2\xa0ind\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922), and it was particularly significantly greater (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01) in the top soil (0\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0cm depth) of agroecosystem-I (2321 vs. 1877\xc2\xa0ind\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922). With regards to macrofauna taxonomic groups and population density our study area falls in the middle range reported for the world (taxonomic groups\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa011-22; population density\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01637\xe2\x80\x939500\xc2\xa0ind\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922). Decomposition of the Oak and Pine leaf litter was significantly lower (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01) in macrofauna-excluded litter bags in agroecosystem-I (63.4 vs. 49.4%) than in agroecosystem-II (44.4 vs. 29.2%). Levels of available nutrients (NO3-N,NH4-N, PO4-P and available K) were significantly higher in the soil of control plots than in treatment plots. This study concludes that soil macrofauna plays an important role in litter decomposition and soil quality maintenance, and recommends that nutrient rich Oak leaf litter should be preferred over Pine leaf litter to promote macrofauna diversity and abundance and soil quality enhancement in the rainfed farming of Central Himalaya."

Recent phytoplankton increments followed, once Fe-, P-, and N-nutrient limitations of commensal diazotrophs and dinoflagellates were also eliminated by respective human desertification, deforestation, and eutrophication during climate changes. Si-limitation of diatoms instead ensued during these last anthropogenic perturbations of agricultural effluents and sewage loadings. Consequently, ~\xc2\xa015% of total world-wide annual asthma trigger responses, i.e. amounting to ~\xc2\xa045 million adjacent humans during 2004, resulted from brevetoxin and palytoxin poisons in aerosol forms of western boundary current origins. They were denoted by greater global harmful algal bloom [HAB] abundances and breathing attacks among sea-side children during prior decadal surveys of asthma prevalence, compiled here in ten paired shelf ecosystems of western and eutrophied boundary currents. Since 1965, such inferred onshore fluxes of aerosolized DOC poisons of HABs may have served as additional wind-borne organic carriers of toxic marine MeHg, phthalate, and DDT/DDE vectors, traced by radio-iodine isotopes to potentially elicit carcinomas. During these exchanges, as much as 40% of mercury poisonings may instead have been effected by inhalation of collateral HAB-carried marine neurotoxic aerosols of MeHg, not just from eating marine fish. Health impacts in some areas were additional asthma and pneumonia episodes, as well as endocrine disruptions among the same adjacent humans, with known large local rates of thyroid cancers, physician-diagnosed pulmonary problems, and ubiquitous high indices of mercury in hair, pesticides in breast milk, and phthalates in urine.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe altitudes of the ecotones between the main vegetation-zones up mountains of the humid tropics are reviewed, with emphasis on floristics and those areas with which the author is personally familiar. A detailed comparison is made of the zonation on Mt Kinabalu (c. 6\xc2\xb0N) and the Himalaya of Bhutan (c. 27\xc2\xb0N), and is supported by information from other parts of SE Asia, and to a decreasing extent South America and Africa. The relationship between forest-types based on structure and physiognomy and forest-types based on floristics is complicated. In SE Asia lower montane forests may be dominated by dipterocarps or an \xe2\x80\x98oak-laurel\xe2\x80\x99 assemblage. The dominant leaf size in both is notophyll, but the oak-laurel assemblage shifts to the microphyll size-class in China where the transition from tropical lower montane to warm temperate lowland forest begins. The opposite trend is seen where the lower montane flora of Papua New Guinea corresponds to the lowland flora in NE Australia. There are only modest changes between the Equator and the Tropic in the altitudes at which major transitions occur. It is concluded that soil changes, mediated only in part by temperature and associated climatic factors, may play a more direct and diverse role than has previously been indicated. The soil factors emphasized are the increase in organic matter content in lower montane soils as opposed to lowland, accompanied by a change from termite-dominance to earthworm-dominance, and the frequent occurrence of a dense moss layer and mor humus in upper montane soils. The case is made particularly by reference to east Asian mountains, which have been the most studied.'

The findings of the present study will help the management authority to take the necessary steps in the identified area to chalk out a comprehensive strategy for control of the invasive plant species. The probable areas most likely to be invaded by the invasive plant species have to be monitored regularly, and intervention like manual uprooting needs to be scheduled during the early stage of its life cycle and before flowering. The frontline staffs of the national park need to be apprised about the ecology and impact of invasive plants for better monitoring and eradication of these detrimental plants.'

However, the expansion of biofuels crops has been either based on direct or indirect displacement of natural ecosystems or on the use of degraded or marginal lands. The former results in direct habitat loss, whereas the later results in usual agricultural impacts (e.g., soil and biotic contamination and water eutrophication). However, in some circumstances biofuels crops can result on an increase in biodiversity compared to other agricultural crops. Agricultural zoning can mitigate the impacts of land use change (LUC), either direct (dLUC) or indirect (iLUC), whereas the use of wildlife-friendly techniques can mitigate the impacts of agriculture intensification. However, in both cases long-term biodiversity monitoring programs should be established in order to help the decision making process concerning the conflict between the expansion of biofuels crops and the conservation of biodiversity.'

The data from MODIS on-board Terra satellite during 2001\xe2\x80\x932008 have been used to study the spatial and temporal variability of AOD and also to identify homogeneous aerosol regions over South India. In this study we found two distinct regions within the selected study region that are characterised by low and high coefficients of variation (COV) of AOD values. The region with low COV is characterised by high AOD and vice versa. The spatial correlation is found to be symmetric for in-land locations but skewed towards Bay of Bengal for coastal locations. The spatial correlation is found to be significant for a radial distance of 150\xc2\xa0km from the region of interest.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Study of spatial homogeneity of aerosols over a large area has been attempted for the first time. \xe2\x96\xba Study region is classified into two distinct regions based on coefficient of variation of AOD. \xe2\x96\xba Spatial homogeneity of aerosols is found to be skewed towards Bay of Bengal for coastal locations. \xe2\x96\xba AOD can be considered to be homogeneous for a radial distance of 100\xe2\x80\x93150\xc2\xa0km. \xe2\x96\xba Spatial homogeneity of aerosols is very useful in assessing quality of the satellite data at different resolutions."

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper is a case study of the contemporary changes that affect the Sanjay Gandhi National Park and its surroundings in the city of Mumbai. It cross-examines the relationships between urban nature and urban space in the case of a city of the South. We argue that the issue of equitable access to urban nature is embedded in the larger question of the Right to the City. We show how processes of urban growth that lead to a shrinking of the forested area are associated with a differentiation of the Right to the City, rather than a general consolidation of claims on space. Defence of the park is mobilised to redefine urban citizenship and leads to a form of graduated citizenship. This differentiates those who see their claims on urban space consolidated; those whose urban citizenship is degraded, and those for whom urban citizenship is denied.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba The Sanjay Gandhi National Park is located within the 20 million metropolis of Mumbai. \xe2\x96\xba No collaboration between park and city management has led to slum settlement within the park. \xe2\x96\xba We analyse the urban dwellers (\xe2\x80\x9ctribals\xe2\x80\x9d, slums, middle classes) in the park. \xe2\x96\xba The Right to the City is redefined in relation to environment. \xe2\x96\xba The urban political ecology framework is refined by our research at the local scale.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Analysis of high relief/elevation landforms has reinforced the uniqueness of mountain morphology.\xe2\x80\xa2Spatial disconnectivity characterizes all slopes and river channels.\xe2\x80\xa2Temporal intermittency of sediment flux characterizes all geomorphic process.\xe2\x80\xa2Hydroclimate change is reinforcing the uniqueness of arctic and alpine mountains.\xe2\x80\xa2The Anthropocene is reinforcing the uniqueness of inter-tropical mountains.AbstractThree themes in global mountain geomorphology have been defined and reinforced over the past decade: (a) new ways of measuring, sensing, and analyzing mountain morphology; (b) a new emphasis on disconnectivity in mountain geomorphology; and (c) the emergence of concerns about the increasing influence of anthropogenic disturbance of the mountain geomorphic environment, especially in intertropical mountains where population densities are higher than in any other mountain region. Anthropogenically induced hydroclimate change increases geomorphic hazards and risks but also provides new opportunities for mountain landscape enhancement. Each theme is considered with respect to the distinctiveness of mountain geomorphology and in relation to important advances in research over the past decade. The traditional reliance on the high energy condition to define mountain geomorphology seems less important than the presence of unique mountain landforms and landscapes and the distinctive ways in which human activity and anthropogenically induced hydroclimate change are transforming mountain landscapes.'

Title: 'Global patterns and trends in the use and management of commercial NTFPs: Implications for livelihoods and conservation'
Author: 'Brian'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X05000951
Abstract: 'SummaryUnderstanding of the role and potential of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) for livelihood improvement and conservation has been hindered by a lack of a clear theoretical framework and a functional typology of cases. To help fill this gap, we did a comparative analysis of 61 cases of commercial NTFP production in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Cases were documented using a standardized set of descriptors organized into categories describing various aspects of the production-to-consumption system. Exploratory analysis yielded useful case groupings by (a) household economic strategy and (b) NTFP production strategy. These groups and their key characteristics are used as a basis for discussing the development and conservation implications of NTFPs.'

Title: 'Carbon sequestration versus bioenergy: A case study from South India exploring the relative land-use efficiency of two options for climate change mitigation'
Author: 'J.M.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0961953409002116
Abstract: 'AbstractThis case study has been carried out as a comparison between two different land-use strategies for climate change mitigation, with possible application within the Clean Development Mechanisms. The benefits of afforestation for carbon sequestration versus for bioenergy production are compared in the context of development planning to meet increasing domestic and agricultural demand for electricity in Hosahalli village, Karnataka, India. One option is to increase the local biomass based electricity generation, requiring an increased biomass plantation area. This option is compared with fossil based electricity generation where the area is instead used for producing wood for non-energy purposes while also sequestering carbon in the soil and standing biomass. The different options have been assessed using the PRO-COMAP model. The ranking of the different options varies depending on the system boundaries and time period. Results indicate that, in the short term (30 years) perspective, the mitigation potential of the long rotation plantation is largest, followed by the short rotation plantation delivering wood for energy. The bioenergy option is however preferred if a long-term view is taken. Short rotation forests delivering wood for short-lived non-energy products have the smallest mitigation potential, unless a large share of the wood products are used for energy purposes (replacing fossil fuels) after having served their initial purpose. If managed in a sustainable manner all of these strategies can contribute to the improvement of the social and environmental situation of the local community.'

Title: 'Hot and bothered: Using trait-based approaches to assess climate change vulnerability in reptiles'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The first ever global trait-based analysis of climate change vulnerability in reptiles\xe2\x80\xa2Data were collected for a random sample of 1498 reptiles.\xe2\x80\xa280.5% of species were highly sensitive to climate change.\xe2\x80\xa2Overall, 22% of species were found to be highly vulnerable to climate change.\xe2\x80\xa2Climate change vulnerable species do not spatially overlap species listed as threatened on the IUCN Red List.AbstractOne-fifth of the world's reptiles are currently estimated as threatened with extinction, primarily due to the immediate threats of habitat loss and overexploitation. Climate change presents an emerging slow-acting threat. However, few IUCN Red List assessments for reptiles explicitly consider the potential role of climate change as a threat. Thus, climate change vulnerability assessments can complement existing Red List assessments and highlight further, emerging priorities for conservation action.Here we present the first trait-based global climate change vulnerability assessment for reptiles to estimate the climate change vulnerability of a random representative sample of 1498 species of reptiles. We collected species-specific traits relating to three dimensions of climate change, sensitivity, low adaptability, and exposure, which we combined to assess overall vulnerability.We found 80.5% of species highly sensitive to climate change, primarily due to habitat specialisation, while 48% had low adaptability and 58% had high exposure. Overall, 22% of species assessed were highly vulnerable to climate change. Hotspots of climate change vulnerability did not always overlap with hotspots of threatened species richness, with most of the vulnerable species found in northwestern South America, southwestern USA, Sri Lanka, the Himalayan Arc, Central Asia and southern India. Most families were found to be significantly more vulnerable to climate change than expected by chance.Our findings build on previous work on reptile extinction risk to provide an overview of the risk posed to reptiles by climate change. Despite significant data gaps for a number of traits, we recommend that these findings are integrated into reassessments of species' extinction risk, to monitor both immediate and slow-acting threats to reptiles."

Abstract: 'AbstractEnvironmental disasters and socio-ecological vulnerability associated with human capacity in any disaster affected region of the world is considered as a key factor in understanding the occurrence of environmental disasters, and consequently, in developing and applying adequate strategies for prevention. The identification of risks and the factors responsible for vulnerability are crucial in analysis and framing strategies for coping and adaptation to the situation. The present paper focuses on identification of potential indicators for disaster risk assessment, socio-economic and cultural vulnerability of local people while striving to cope with shocks of disaster and adaptation and coping strategies of people to mitigate the impact of disaster in Kedarnath valley of Uttarakhand. Based on the long term research and assessment of potential cost-effective bio-resources available locally, this article recommends some of the priority interventions and technology packages for the immediate implementation as well as capacity building of the community to make them economically sustainable and future-ready to respond swiftly towards such catastrophe with less negative impact. Only appropriate strategic framework and their implementation can sustain the human as well as biodiversity in the fragile Himalayan landscape.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (295KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Satellite Earth observation data to identify anthropogenic pressures in selected protected areas'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Parks experience stress from human pressures, which require mapping and monitoring.\xe2\x80\xa2Earth observation (EO) data can monitor changes in state resulting from pressure over time.\xe2\x80\xa2Impact on landscapes, habitats and species communities can be related to pressure.\xe2\x80\xa2EO data useful for monitoring pressure and changes in state are listed for parks in six countries.\xe2\x80\xa2The approach is illustrated in two contexts in Italy and The Netherlands.AbstractProtected areas are experiencing increased levels of human pressure. To enable appropriate conservation action, it is critical to map and monitor changes in the type and extent of land cover/use and habitat classes, which can be related to human pressures over time. Satellite Earth observation (EO) data and techniques offer the opportunity to detect such changes. Yet association with field information and expert interpretation by ecologists is required to interpret, qualify and link these changes to human pressure. There is thus an urgent need to harmonize the technical background of experts in the field of EO data analysis with the terminology of ecologists, protected area management authorities and policy makers in order to provide meaningful, context-specific value-added EO products. This paper builds on the DPSIR framework, providing a terminology to relate the concepts of state, pressures, and drivers with the application of EO analysis. The type of pressure can be inferred through the detection of changes in state (i.e. changes in land cover and/or habitat type and/or condition). Four broad categories of changes in state are identified, i.e. land cover/habitat conversion, land cover/habitat modification, habitat fragmentation and changes in landscape connectivity, and changes in plant community structure. These categories of change in state can be mapped through EO analyses, with the goal of using expert judgement to relate changes in state to causal direct anthropogenic pressures. Drawing on expert knowledge, a set of protected areas located in diverse socio-ecological contexts and subject to a variety of pressures are analysed to (a) link the four categories of changes in state of land cover/habitats to the drivers (anthropogenic pressure), as relevant to specific target land cover and habitat classes; (b) identify (for pressure mapping) the most appropriate spatial and temporal EO data sources as well as interpretations from ecologists and field data useful in connection with EO data analysis. We provide detailed examples for two protected areas, demonstrating the use of EO data for detection of land cover/habitat change, coupled with expert interpretation to relate such change to specific anthropogenic pressures. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations and feasibility of using EO data and techniques to identify anthropogenic pressures, suggesting additional research efforts required in this direction.'

Title: 'Rapid assessment of biological richness in a part of Eastern Himalaya: an integrated three-tier approach'
Author: 'M.D.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112704008187
Abstract: "AbstractBiodiversity conservation necessitates not only preservation of single or multiple species but also the habitat as a whole along with its environment. Biological richness (BR) is a cumulative property of an ecological habitat and its surrounding environment, which has emerging implications in terms of management and planning. Six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical and ecological) were linked together based on their relative importance to qualitatively stratify biological richness of forest vegetation in Subansiri district of Eastern Himalaya using customized software, Bio_CAP. Higher biological richness was assigned to the habitats with (i) high species diversity, (ii) high degree of ecosystem uniqueness (EU), (iii) high economical value, (iv) complex terrain and (v) low disturbance level. This simple idea of integrated \xe2\x80\x98three-tier modeling approach\xe2\x80\x99 of (i) utilization of geospatial tools, (ii) limited field survey and (iii) landscape analysis; formed the basis of rapid assessment of biological richness.Satellite image interpretation using hybrid classification approach provided spatial distribution of vegetation types (corresponding to ecological habitats), with 89% accuracy. Landscape analysis was done using various quantitative indices that measured the heterogeneity and evaluated the patch characteristics. A methodology was developed for deriving relative adjacency weights from field data for calculation of juxtaposition of vegetation types. Biotic disturbance buffers (i.e., proximity zones around roads and human settlements) along with landscape parameters were combined to calculate disturbance index (DI), which in turn became an intermediate surrogate for BR assessment. Species diversity patterns along fragmentation and biotic disturbance gradients were adjudged to derive relative weights for DI computation. Species diversity (Shannon's index), ecosystem uniqueness (endemism status) and biodiversity value (BV) (total importance value (TIV)) were enumerated quantitatively that provided relative weights for BR computation. Terrain complexity (TC) was generated by calculating variance of the elevation image. Fifty-nine of total 764 species were found endemic to Eastern Himalaya with over all species endemism of 13 per ha. Shannon's index increased with decrease in fragmentation levels and increase of distance from sources of disturbance. BR index of the district was presented in five qualitative levels. Subtropical forests claim highest degree of biological richness as well as high disturbance index. This methodology has implications for rapid biodiversity assessment. Forest managers can use the DI and BR maps for gap analysis and prioritization of conservation activities viz., introduction of locale-specific species, thus protecting the forest habitats in situ."

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Non-edible vegetable oil based lubricants are sustainable alternatives to mineral oil.\xe2\x80\xa2Non-edible oil shows better properties like lubricity, viscosity, anti-wear.\xe2\x80\xa2The use of eco-friendly lubricants would result in less degradation of the environment.AbstractLubricants act as anti-friction media and help in reducing wear of the components in contact during motion of the machine parts. Around the globe, petroleum based reserves are going to deplete which could result in price hike and create concern about environmental pollution. The researchers are focusing on developing and using an eco-friendly lubricant derived from renewable resources. Non-edible vegetable oil based bio-lubricants are eco-friendly lubricants due to their biodegradability, non-toxicity and zero greenhouse gas emission. This study presents the potential use of non-edible vegetable oil for the production of bio-lubricants. In this study, resources, properties, benefits, and application of non-edible vegetable oil based bio-lubricants as alternatives were discussed. It also includes the description of the global lubricant market and future scope. Non-edible vegetable oil based bio-lubricants have enhanced lubricity, high viscosity, good anti-wear property, high viscosity index, increases equipment service life, high load carrying ability, low evaporation rate, low emission of metal traces into the atmosphere.'

Abstract: 'AbstractEthnopharmacological relevanceClerodendrum serratum (L.) Moon. (Verbenaceae) is an important medicinal plant growing in the tropical and warm temperate regions like Africa, Southern Asia; Malaysia and distributed throughout in forests of India and Sri Lanka. It is traditionally valued and reported for treating pain, inflammation, rheumatism, respiratory disorders, fever and malarial fever in India with a long history. To provide a comprehensive overview of the traditional and ethno medicinal uses, phytochemistry and biological activities of C. serratum with clinical and toxicity data and possibly make recommendations for further research.Materials and methodsAll relevant worldwide accepted databases were searched for the terms \xe2\x80\x9cClerodendrum\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cClerodendrum serratum\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cBharangi\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCheruthekku\xe2\x80\x9d along with the other literature from Indian classical texts and pharmacopoeias. There was no specific timeline set for the search. The accessible literatures available on C. serratum were collected via electronic search using Pubmed, Scopus, Science Direct and traditional books reports on ethnopharmacology and traditional medicines.ResultsC. serratum has played an important role in Indian system of medicine. In addition to the common local use in respiratory diseases, other ethnomedicinal uses include treatment of pain, inflammation, rheumatism and fever especially malarial fever. Scientific studies on extracts and formulations revealed anti-asthmatic, mast cell stabilization and anti-allergic effects of roots of C. serratum. Reported data on pharmacological activities also includes hepatoprotective, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer potential of the drug. Saponins (terpenoids and steroids), flavonoids and phenolics isolated from roots have been the focus of phytochemical investigations as the biological activity has been ascribed to the saponins, which are known to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activity. Isolated bioactives from roots like icosahydropicenic acid and ursolic acid have been claimed to offer anti-allergic and hepatoprotective activity.ConclusionsTherapeutic potential of roots and leaves of C. serratum has been demonstrated in the conditions like asthma, allergy, fever, inflammation and liver disorders attributed to the presence of various flavonoids, phenolics and saponins present in the drug. Many ethnobotanical claims have been confirmed through modern in-vitro and in-vivo pharmacological studies of different extracts and isolates from plant; however, additional studies on the biomarkers are needed to establish mechanism of action and to validate the traditional use of this drug in clinical practices after proper safety assessment.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (226KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe status and trends of global biodiversity are often measured with a bias towards datasets limited to terrestrial vertebrates. The first global assessment of an insect order (Odonata) provides new context to the ongoing discussion of current biodiversity loss. A randomly selected sample of 1500 (26.4%) of the 5680 described dragonflies and damselflies was assessed using IUCN\xe2\x80\x99s Red List criteria. Distribution maps for each species were created and species were assigned to habitat types. These data were analysed in respect to threat level for regions and habitat types. We have found that one in 10 species of dragonflies and damselflies is threatened with extinction. This threat level is among the lowest of groups that have been assessed to date, suggesting that previous estimates of extinction risk for insects might be misleading. However, Odonata only comprise a small invertebrate order, with above-average dispersal ability and relatively wide distribution ranges. For conservation science and policy to be truly representative of global biodiversity a representative cross-section of invertebrates needs to be included.'

Abstract: "AbstractThe present urbanized world is on a vogue to remold its impression and character into someone else's. The new impressions often carries a complete disconnect from its roots which gradually loses its self and identity and never has a sustenance. In this context Form Based Coding(FBC) as a tool in Urban Design Process aids to come up with solutions whichstrongly holds the people to their community and closelyassociated with culture through the physical spaces they areassociated with. The paper has made an effort to analyze theprocess of FBC as a genuine tool to establish the association ofphysical form and spaces with the public realm to uphold thecontext and culture by taking a case in the heritage rich centralcommercial core of Thiruvananthapuram city, Chalai. Chalai isundergoing a tremendous transformation in its physical formdisregarding its strong culture and context and this can influencethe inherent native character of the bazaar activity and looses itsidentity in form and function. In this regard form Based Codingwill be a suitable tool to strengthen it as a native bazaar for thecity.A detailed documentation of form in relation with the existing layers of street pattern, activity, building types, and function is analysed and its influences to variations in form is studied. The existing codes of the built form of different uses were decoded. The comparison of existing codes with the theoretical parameters from literature and case studies lead to the formulation of codes with FBC as a tool suitable for the context."

Experimental tests were investigated to study the performance, combustion and emission on computerized single cylinder CI diesel engine fueled with diesel and B20 (20% (vol.) of MME biodiesel\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa080% (vol.) of diesel) along with each of the three nozzles has 3 injection holes, with the aperture of \xc3\x98\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.20\xc2\xa0mm (modified), \xc3\x98\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.28\xc2\xa0mm (base), and \xc3\x98\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.31\xc2\xa0mm (modified). The engine performance, combustion and emission is examined by measuring BSFC, BTE, In-cylinder pressure, MGT, HRR, CO, HC, NOx and smoke opacity. The authentic results were observed by using B20 and smaller orifice NHD. It is observed that smaller orifice NHD improves the air-fuel mixing, atomization, and vaporization which leads to shorter combustion duration. The B20 fuel showed better results such as performance at lower side of partial loads, combustion and emissions than the baseline diesel. The combination of B20 with smaller orifice NHD has shown appreciable results in performance, combustion and emissions. But, the only drawback was NOx is found to be increased."

Abstract: 'TrendsConservation requires methods to identify species and to identify, locate, and track individual plants and animals. These methods have become better, faster, less intrusive, and cheaper. So, too, has remote sensing that now allows detailed and frequent assessments of species\xe2\x80\x99 habitats and how human actions are changing them.Even the best technologies to mark individuals may pose unacceptable hazards for endangered species. Creative approaches find new, non-invasive alternatives.Crowdsourced data are becoming the dominant source of information on species\xe2\x80\x99 distributions and new approaches are solving the problems of reliability.The most important trends are progress in technologies that are appropriate to the often remote and low-technology environments in which frontline conservation actions unfold and the inclusion of previously unused communities who might contribute essential data.Technologies to identify individual animals, follow their movements, identify and locate animal and plant species, and assess the status of their habitats remotely have become better, faster, and cheaper as threats to the survival of species are increasing. New technologies alone do not save species, and new data create new problems. For example, improving technologies alone cannot prevent poaching: solutions require providing appropriate tools to the right people. Habitat loss is another driver: the challenge here is to connect existing sophisticated remote sensing with species occurrence data to predict where species remain. Other challenges include assembling a wider public to crowdsource data, managing the massive quantities of data generated, and developing solutions to rapidly emerging threats.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Table 1 provides the most comprehensive literature review to date: 100 conflict cases.\xe2\x80\xa2Mining conflicts are on the rise in India over the past 20 years.\xe2\x80\xa2Small-scale sand mining, often illegal, generated the largest number of conflicts.\xe2\x80\xa2Conflicts over metal extraction pit local populations against large corporations.\xe2\x80\xa2The causes were often environmental, especially related to water and livelihoods.AbstractMineral extraction is growing worldwide, generating serious social and environmental impacts, and in the process, sparking significant resistance. The present article provides the first overview of non-fuel mining conflicts in India. The analysis is based on 100 cases of conflicts that occurred between 1992 and 2014, which constitutes the most exhaustive database compiled to date. In each case, location, mineral extracted, actors involved, cited causes of protest, conflict duration and outcomes were recorded. We found that the commodity responsible for the most conflicts is sand, the extraction of which is widespread and often carried out illegally by small-scale actors near rivers. Resistance against metallic ore mining, in contrast, typically pits local populations against larger corporations. Most resistance movements are composed of subaltern rural and/or indigenous populations; very few national and international NGOs were found to be involved in local movements. The causes of such conflicts have largely been ecological and responsible for an undermining of local livelihoods. Mineral extraction is expected to increase in India over the next decade, and with it, the number of associated conflicts.'

Title: 'Assessing the mitigation potential of forestry activities in a changing climate: A case study for Karnataka'
Author: 'Kaysara'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389934109002032
Abstract: "AbstractThe Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol allows Afforestation and Reforestation (A/R) projects as mitigation activities to offset the CO2 in the atmosphere whilst simultaneously seeking to ensure sustainable development for the host country. The Kyoto Protocol was ratified by the Government of India in August 2002 and one of India's objectives in acceding to the Protocol was to fulfil the prerequisites for implementation of projects under the CDM in accordance with national sustainable priorities. The objective of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of using large-scale forestry projects under the CDM in achieving its twin goals using Karnataka State as a case study. The Generalized Comprehensive Mitigation Assessment Process (GCOMAP) Model is used to observe the effect of varying carbon prices on the land available for A/R projects. The model is coupled with outputs from the Lund\xe2\x80\x93Potsdam\xe2\x80\x93Jena (LPJ) Dynamic Global Vegetation Model to incorporate the impacts of temperature rise due to climate change under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2, A1B and B1. With rising temperatures and CO2, vegetation productivity is increased under A2 and A1B scenarios and reduced under B1. Results indicate that higher carbon price paths produce higher gains in carbon credits and accelerate the rate at which available land hits maximum capacity thus acting as either an incentive or disincentive for landowners to commit their lands to forestry mitigation projects."

Title: 'A multi-locus plastid phylogenetic analysis of the pantropical genus Diospyros (Ebenaceae), with an emphasis on the radiation and biogeographic origins of the New Caledonian endemic species'
Author: 'Sutee'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790309001377
Abstract: 'AbstractWe aimed to clarify phylogenetic relationships within the pantropical genus Diospyros (Ebenaceae sensulato), and ascertain biogeographical patterns in the New Caledonian endemic species. We used DNA sequences from eight plastid regions (rbcL, atpB, matK, ndhF, trnK intron, trnL intron, trnL-trnF spacer, and trnS-trnG spacer) and included 149 accessions representing 119 Diospyros species in our analysis. Results from this study confirmed the monophyly of Diospyros with good support and provided a clearer picture of the relationships within the genus than in previous studies. Evidence from phylogenetic analyses suggests that Diospyros colonized New Caledonia multiple times. The four lineages of Diospyros in New Caledonia also differ in their degree of diversification. The molecular data indicate that one lineage is paleoendemic and derived from an ancient Australian species. The other three lineages are more closely related to several Southeast Asian species; two of them are neoendemics, and one has radiated rapidly and recently.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe high elevational areas in the Himalayas of India are dominated by forests and alpine pastures. There are many protected areas in the region, including Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) and Valley of Flowers (VOF) where natural resource management plan (NRMP) has been implemented for the conservation of biodiversity. This has affected the traditional animal husbandry system, as well as the vegetation dynamics of alpine pastures. An integrated approach to studying the impact of NRMP in the region has been applied by us. First, a survey was conducted regarding livestock management, data pertaining the livestock husbandry, the role of animal husbandry in economics of rural household, and socioeconomics. Second, field based study on phytosociology of some important alpine herbs was done to enumerate the density and species richness in different land mark of the region. Thereafter, satellite data and Geographic Information System (GIS) were used to develop a land cover map of the area and to note changes in the landscape over time after implementation of NRMP. From an economic point of view the implementation of such plan is a setback to the rural economy. However, the ecological perspective of such models is a threat to the diversity of alpine pastures. The invasion of bushes/thorny bushes/shrubs and weeds with their luxuriant growth is changing the vegetation index and dynamics. Consequently, the diversity of herbs in alpine pastures of the Himalayan Mountains is in jeopardy. Overall, the situation is leading to landscape change in the region. This study is helpful for generating useful outcomes and strategies considering the question or debate \xe2\x80\x9cis grazing good or bad for pasture ecosystems in the Himalayas?\xe2\x80\x9d.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Electric field and Maxwell current data show that 10 out of 32 thunderstorms were having inverted polarity charge structure.\xe2\x80\xa2All thunderstorms with inverted polarity occurred on days with higher AOD compared to normal polarity thunderstorms.\xe2\x80\xa2Observations suggest high ice nuclei concentration can produce inverted polarity charge structure in ordinary thunderstorms.AbstractThe electric field and Maxwell current density measured below 32 small isolated thunderstorms over Pune (India) have been analyzed here. These data clearly show the presence of 10 out of 32 thunderstorms with inverted polarity charge structure. Values of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) on thunderstorm days taken from MODIS show that all the thunderstorms with inverted polarity occurred on days with significantly higher AOD compared to normal polarity thunderstorms. The peak flash rate did not show significant difference between normal polarity thunderstorms and inverted polarity thunderstorms. The dew point depression (DPD) during pre-monsoon thunderstorms shows good correlation with inverted polarity charge structure. Observations suggest that aerosol concentration plays an important role in the formation of inverted polarity charge structure in these thunderclouds. In presence of high aerosol concentration with adequate ice nuclei non-inductive charging mechanism can produce strong and wide spread positive charge region in the lower portion of cloud. However, observed good correlation of DPD with inverted polarity charge structure in the pre-monsoon period suggest that the effect of high cloud base height on inverted polarity charge structure as suggested by Williams et al. (2005) cannot be ruled out.'

Commensurate with the present day aversion to the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides; there is an overt emphasis on use of organic inputs and microbial inoculants which play an important role in sustainable agriculture. Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are an important group of microbial inoculants that have been studied extensively for their ability to promote plant growth and improve productivity. PGPR operate through either direct or indirect mechanisms or a combination of both, and there by minimize the environmental impact of chemical intensive farming practices. Direct mechanisms of plant growth promotion include the secretion of plant growth promoting metabolites like indole acetic acid (IAA), cytokinins, gibberellins, etc., and facilitating the uptake of essential nutrients (N, P, Fe, Zn, etc.) from the atmospheric air and soil. Indirect promotion of the plant growth occurs when PGPR lessen or prevent the deleterious effect of phytopathogenic organisms by the production of antibiotics, siderophores, hydrogen cyanide (HCN), etc. Well known PGPRs that have reached the stage of commercial success, include Azospirillium, Azotobacter, Bacillus Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, and Serratia. But there are several novel PGPR on which considerable information is available, but such organisms have not attained commercial scales of production unlike their better known predecessors. PGPRs like Azoarcus, Exiguobacterium, Methylobacterium, Paenibacillus and Pantoea etc., fall in this category. The information available on these novel PGPRs with regard to their biology and utility are discussed in this review.'

Title: 'Present and prospective role of bioenergy in regional energy system'
Author: 'T.V'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032100000022
Abstract: 'AbstractBioenergy is the energy released from the reaction of organic carbon material with oxygen. The organic material derived from plants and animals is also referred to as biomass. Biomass is a flexible feedstock capable of conversion into solid, liquid and gaseous fuels by chemical and biological processes. These intermediate biofuels (such as methane gas, ethanol, charcoal) can be substituted for fossil based fuels. Wood and charcoal are important as household fuels and for small scale industries such as brick making, cashew processing etc. The scarcity of biofuels has far reaching implications on the environment. Hence, expansion of bioenergy systems could be influential in bettering both the socio-economic condition and the environment of the region. This paper examines the present role of biomass in the region\xe2\x80\x99s (Uttara Kannada District, Karnataka State, India) energy supply and calculates the potential for future biomass provision and scope for conversion to both modern and traditional fuels. Based on the detailed investigation of biomass resource availability and demand, we can categorise the Uttara Kannada District into two zones (a) Biomass surplus zone consisting of Taluks mainly from hilly area (b) Biomass deficit zone, consisting of thickly populated coastal Taluks such as Bhatkal, Kumta, Ankola, Honnavar and Karwar. Fuel wood is mainly used for cooking and horticulture residues from coconut, arecanut trees are used for water heating purposes. Most of the households in this region still use traditional stoves where efficiency is less than 10%. The present inefficient fuel consumption could be brought down by the usage of fuel efficient stoves (a saving of the order of 27%). Availability of animal residues for biogas generation in Sirsi, Siddapur, Yellapur Taluks gives a viable alternative for cooking, lighting fuel and a useful fertiliser. However to support the present livestock population, fodder from agricultural residues is insufficient in these Taluks. There is a need to supplement the fodder availability with fodder crops as successfully tried in Banavasi village by some progressive farmers.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2This study deals with arsenic hydrochemistry in the aquifer system of Puducherry region.\xe2\x80\xa2Marine and fluvial sediments composed of As and Fe bearing minerals are found to be the major source for arsenic.\xe2\x80\xa2Reductive Dissolution is the dominant mechanism contributing As into groundwater.\xe2\x80\xa2Groundwater in northern and southern part of study area is contaminated by Arsenic.\xe2\x80\xa2Arsenic in groundwater is of geogenic origin.AbstractTo understand occurrence, distribution and source of arsenic, 175 groundwater samples from coastal aquifers of the Puducherry region were collected and analyzed for major ions and trace metals. The concentration of As in groundwater of study area ranges from not detectable \xe2\x80\x94 28.88\xe2\x80\xaf\xce\xbcg/L during the post-monsoon and not detectable \xe2\x80\x94 36.88\xe2\x80\xaf\xce\xbcg/L in the pre-monsoon. The desirable limit for As in groundwater is 10\xe2\x80\xaf\xce\xbcg/L as per World Health Organization and Bureau of Indian standard. About 13.64 and 11.50% of groundwater samples shows arsenic concentration higher than recommended limit. Hydrochemical facies which dominate during pre and post monsoon are Na-K-Cl-SO4, Ca-Cl and Ca-Mg-Cl-SO4type and Na-K-Cl-SO4, mixedCa-Na-HCO3, Ca-HCO3 and mixed Ca-Mg-Cl type respectively. The Gibbs diagram suggested that rock-water interaction is major process controlling hydrochemistry of groundwater. From the Pourbaix diagram, it is inferred that H3AsO3 is the principal As species in groundwater. The PHREEQC modelling indicates supersaturation of ferric oxides and hydroxide mineral phases in aquifer system which on reductive dissolution releases arsenic into groundwater. Statistical analysis (Spearman Correlation and Principal Component Analysis) showed that reductive dissolution of As-bearing minerals and Fe-oxyhydroxides in the presence of organic matter is the major process contributing arsenic into groundwater. The relationship between As, K+ and HCO\xe2\x88\x923 indicates agricultural and competitive exchange process which is an additional contributor of arsenic in groundwater. The sources which act as a sink and responsible for the release of As into the groundwater are marine sediments enriched in As and Fe-bearing minerals and organic matter.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (102KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'PEDOSPHERELeaf and Ecosystem Gas Exchange Responses of Buffel Grass-Dominated Grassland to Summer Precipitation'
Author: 'Mir Zaman'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1002016014600813
Abstract: 'ABSTRACTSporadic rain events that occur during summer play an important role in the initiation of biological activity of semi-arid grasslands. To understand how ecosystem processes of a buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.)-dominated grassland respond to summer rain events, an LI 6 400 gas exchange system was used to measure the leaf gas exchange and plant canopy chambers were used to measure net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and ecosystem respiration (Reco), which were made sequentially during periods before rain (dry) and after rain (wet). Gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) was estimated from NEE and Reco fluxes, and light use efficiency parameters were estimated using a rectangular hyperbola model. Prior to the monsoon rain, grassland biomass was non-green and dry exhibiting positive NEE (carbon source) and low GEP values during which the soil water became increasingly scarce. An initial rain pulse (60 mm) increased the NEE from pre-monsoon levels to negative NEE (carbon gain) with markedly higher GEP and increased green biomass. The leaf photosynthesis and leaf stomatal conductance were also improved substantially. The maximum net CO2 uptake (i.e., negative NEE) was sustained in the subsequent period due to multiple rain events. As a result, the grassland acted as a net carbon sink for 20 d after first rain. With cessation of rain (drying cycle), net CO2 uptake was reduced to lower values. High sensitivity of this grassland to rain suggests that any decrease in precipitation in summer may likely affect the carbon sequestration of the semiarid ecosystem.'

This knowledge has contributed to our understanding of how the climate change-related pedogenic processes during the Holocene altered soil properties in the presence or absence of soil modifiers (Ca-zeolites and gypsum), calcium carbonate and palygorskite minerals. These state-of-the-art methods have established an organic link between pedogenic processes and bulk soil properties; the review also considers the need to modify the classification of vertisols at the subgroup level.

Abstract: "AbstractEmpirical research provides contradictory evidence of the loss of traditional ecological knowledge across societies. Researchers have argued that culture, methodological differences, and site-specific conditions are responsible for such contradictory evidences. We advance and test a third explanation: the adaptive nature of traditional ecological knowledge systems. Specifically, we test whether different domains of traditional ecological knowledge experience different secular changes and analyze trends in the context of other changes in livelihoods. We use data collected among 651 Tsimane' men (Bolivian Amazon). Our findings indicate that different domains of knowledge follow different secular trends. Among the domains of knowledge analyzed, medicinal knowledge and wild edible knowledge appear as the most vulnerable; canoe building knowledge and firewood knowledge seem to remain constant across generations; whereas house building knowledge seems to experience a slight secular increase. Our analysis reflects on the adaptive nature of traditional ecological knowledge, highlighting how changes in this knowledge system respond to the particular needs of a society in a given point of time.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Different domains of traditional plant knowledge follow different secular changes. \xe2\x96\xba The most vulnerable knowledge for Tsimane' men relates to medicinal and wild edibles. \xe2\x96\xba Knowledge of firewood and canoe building seems stable among Tsimane' men. \xe2\x96\xba Knowledge related to house building experience a secular increase. \xe2\x96\xba Secular changes in traditional plant knowledge are associated to changes in livelihood."

Abstract: 'AbstractSacred natural sites are considered an additional pillar for biodiversity conservation, next to the protected areas network. However, sacred landscapes are not primarily conservation areas, but exist for cultural and social reasons. To evaluate their strengths and weaknesses as community-based conservation areas, a thorough understanding of the underlying values, institutional arrangements, and outcomes is required. Here, I use institutional economics for a meta-analysis of publications on sacred natural sites to identify potential conflicts in their maintenance, and to analyze institutional arrangements to solve these conflicts. I show that most sacred natural sites resemble common-pool resources and that many design principles that are linked to common-pool resources are also found in traditional institutions managing sacred places. Design principles are no blue-print solution but they may guide future research to identify locally robust institutional arrangements that are linked to the ecological integrity of sacred natural sites.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Sacred natural sites exist for spiritual, cultural, social, economic, and ecological values. \xe2\x96\xba Biodiversity conservation is a concomitant value of sacred natural sites. \xe2\x96\xba Several conflicts of resource management may affect biodiversity negatively. \xe2\x96\xba Interdisciplinary research is required to improve conservation plans of SNS.'

Abstract: 'AbstractKerala coast in southwest India is endowed with an interlacing network of wetlands evolved during the Late Quaternary. The wetlands in the southern part of Kerala, especially around Kollam district, show antecedent characteristics and are incised on the Neogene sediments. These wetlands include 20.0\xe2\x80\x9335.0\xc2\xa0m thick deposits of Holocene sediments containing good archives of landform evolution and climate changes. Holocene sedimentation was initiated at about 8920\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa0110\xc2\xa0BP and is represented mainly by sub-fossil wood/peat or carbonaceous clays. Subsequent deposition of brackish water to marine sediments occurred in the Middle Holocene. The proposed evolutionary model reveals that many wetland bodies including Sasthamkotta Lake, Chelupola Lake, Chittumalachira Lake and Kotta Lake were evolved from the proto-estuarine basins. The upper arms of the pre-Holocene Ashtamudi and Paravur estuaries were cut off due to progradation of alluvial sediments during the Holocene Climatic Optimum.'

Author: 'U.M.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112796037991
Abstract: 'AbstractA study was undertaken to assess the contribution of bamboo to the vegetation structure, biomass productivity and nutrient cycling pattern in 15- and 20-year-old teak plantations in the Kariem-muriem Forest Range, Kerala, India. Based on the distribution pattern of bamboo colonised in these plantations, three types of site were recognised: site type A (bamboo-rich area), site type B (moderately bamboo-rich area) and site type C (bamboo-poor area). Density, basal area, number of culms per hectare, biomass, litter and net primary production of bamboo were greater in site type A than in site types B and C. While the soils of site types A and B were rich in potassium, those of site type C were rich in calcium. In addition to this, a negative correlation between above-ground biomass of bamboo and teak was recorded in site type A. In the case of teak, the rate of accumulation and the enrichment ratio of calcium were more than those of other elements. However, in bamboo, the enrichment ratio and accumulation rate of potassium were higher than in teak. The values for these parameters in bamboo were higher for potassium than for other elements. These results show that even from the nutrient conservation and cycling point of view, bamboo is a suitable species for site type A and teak is suitable for site types B and C. It is recommended that interplanting of bamboo in teak plantation, especially in areas like site types B and C, is not advisable. Instead, patch-planting may be more appropriate both to get better yield and to maintain ecosystem stability. It was also concluded that management of key elements of the ecosystem, such as potassium, is crucial for the stability of the ecosystem after disturbance or the conversion of natural forests into plantations.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The study deals with quantitative characteristics of AOD within different air-mass types over Pune.\xe2\x80\xa2In winter, lower altitude trajectories arriving from SE/E and N sectors favor transport of anthropogenic aerosols over Pune.\xe2\x80\xa2During pre-monsoon, air-masses reaching Pune from NW/W and SW/S produce larger average AOD with lower AE.\xe2\x80\xa2Based on AOD500\xc2\xa0nm and AE values, five aerosol types viz., CA, MCA, UI/B, DD and MT have been identified.AbstractColumnar aerosol properties retrieved from MICROTOPS II Sun Photometer measurements during 2010\xe2\x80\x932013 over Pune (18\xc2\xb032\xe2\x80\xb2N; 73\xc2\xb049\xe2\x80\xb2E, 559\xc2\xa0m amsl), a tropical urban station in India, are analyzed to identify aerosol types in the atmospheric column. Identification/classification is carried out on the basis of dominant airflow patterns, and the method of discrimination of aerosol types on the basis of relation between aerosol optical depth (AOD500\xc2\xa0nm) and \xc3\x85ngstr\xc3\xb6m exponent (AE, \xce\xb1). Five potential advection pathways viz., NW/N, SW/S, N, SE/E and L have been identified over the observing site by employing the NOAA-HYSPLIT air mass back trajectory analysis. Based on AE against AOD500\xc2\xa0nm scatter plot and advection pathways followed five major aerosol types viz., continental average (CA), marine continental average (MCA), urban/industrial and biomass burning (UB), desert dust (DD) and indeterminate or mixed type (MT) have been identified. In winter, sector SE/E, a representative of air masses traversed over Bay of Bengal and Eastern continental Indian region has relatively small AOD (\xcf\x84p\xce\xbb\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.43\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.13) and high AE (\xce\xb1\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01.19\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.15). These values imply the presence of accumulation/sub-micron size anthropogenic aerosols. During pre-monsoon, aerosols from the NW/N sector have high AOD (\xcf\x84p\xce\xbb\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.61\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.21), and low AE (\xce\xb1\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.54\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.14) indicating an increase in the loading of coarse-mode particles over Pune. Dominance of UB type in winter season for all the years (i.e. 2010\xe2\x80\x932013) may be attributed to both local/transported aerosols. During pre-monsoon seasons, MT is the dominant aerosol type followed by UB and DD, while the background aerosols are insignificant.'

Samples of dust were collected from two suburban areas (Thokkottu and Pumpwell located respectively ~\xc2\xa010\xc2\xa0km and 3\xc2\xa0km from the city center), the city center itself (Milagres) and industrial/port areas (Panambur and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL)). Low-frequency magnetic susceptibility (\xcf\x87lf), frequency-dependent susceptibility (\xcf\x87fd), susceptibility of anhysteretic remanent magnetization (\xcf\x87ARM) and isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM 20 to 1000\xc2\xa0mT) were determined on 23 dust samples and inter-parametric ratios calculated. Results show that samples from suburban areas (particularly Thokkottu) are characterized by low \xcf\x87lf (<\xc2\xa0314.1\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa010\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa08\xc2\xa0m3\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01) and up to 6% \xcf\x87fd, suggesting low levels of pollution and the presence of pedogenic magnetite possibly derived from soils by wind erosion. However, the average \xcf\x87lf of Milagres, Panambur and MRPL dust samples is high by factors of 9.2, 3.3 and 2.6 compared to that of the Thokkottu sample. The Milagres sample contains magnetically \xe2\x80\x9csoft\xe2\x80\x9d minerals like magnetite, possibly indicating its derivation from motor vehicle exhaust. In contrast, the Panambur dust sample is characterized by magnetically \xe2\x80\x9chard\xe2\x80\x9d minerals such as hematite and goethite as it has an 8-fold higher HIRM value compared to the Thokkottu sample. This magnetic signature is perhaps the result of dust particles derived from the grinding of hematite-rich iron ore by the Kudremukh Iron Ore Company Limited (KIOCL) at Panambur and its storage and export through the nearby New Mangalore Port. However, the dust sample from MRPL has magnetically \xe2\x80\x9csoft\xe2\x80\x9d minerals like magnetite. This magnetic mineral may have originated from petroleum refining processes at MRPL. Particulate pollution from industrial activities and motor vehicle exhaust is a threat to human health and is known to cause cardiovascular and respiratory ailments. Therefore, the pollution levels brought out by this study warrant a comprehensive epidemiological study in the area of study.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe off grid electrification by utilizing Integrated Renewable Energy System (IRES) is proposed to satisfy the electrical and cooking needs of the seven-uneletrified villages in the Almora district of Uttarakhand state, India. Four different scenarios are considered during modeling and optimization of IRES to ensure reliability parameters such as energy index ratio (EIR) and expected energy not supplied (EENS). The optimum system reliability, total system cost and cost of energy (COE) have also been worked out by introducing the customer interruption cost (CIC). The four different renewable energy scenarios have been compared for the considered study area using the LINGO software version 10. The fourth renewable energy scenario accounting 44.99% micro hydropower (MHP), 30.07% biomass, 5.19% biogas and 4.16% solar energy along with the additional resources of wind (1.27%) and energy plantation (12.33%) has been found to be the best among the different options considered. Furthermore, the optimal reliability for the fourth IRES system has been found to be 0.95 EIR at the optimized cost of Rs 19.44 lacs with estimated COE of Rs 3.36\xc2\xa0per kWh. The COE obtained using LINGO software and HOMER software has also been compared and briefly discussed for all the four scenarios. In order to verify feasibility and cost of system for different biomass fuel prices, a sensitivity analysis has also been carried out and it has been found that the fourth scenario is more sustainable than the other considered options.'

Abstract: 'AbstractCoastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification was issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forest of Government of India in February 1991 as a part of the Environmental Protection Act of 1986 to protect the coast from eroding and to preserve its natural resources. The initial notification did not distinguish the variability and diversity of various coastal states before enforcing it on the various states and Union Territories. Impact assessments were not carried out to assess its impact on socio-economic life of the coastal population. For the very same reason, it was unnoticed or rather ignored till 1994 when the Supreme Court of India made a land mark judgment on the fate of the coastal aquaculture which by then had established as an economically successful industry in many South Indian States. Coastal aquaculture in its modern form was a prohibited activity within CRZ. Lately, only various stakeholders of the coast realized the real impact of the CRZ rules on their property rights and business. To overcome the initial drawbacks several amendments were made in the regulation to suit regional needs.In 1995, another great transformation took place in the State of Kerala as a part of the re-organization of the local self government institutions into a decentralized three tier system called \xe2\x80\x9cPanchayathi Raj System\xe2\x80\x9d. In 1997, the state government also decided to transfer the power with the required budget outlay to the grass root level panchayats (villages) and municipalities to plan and implement the various projects in their localities with the full participation of the local people by constituting Grama Sabhas (Peoples\xe2\x80\x99 Forum). It is called the \xe2\x80\x9cPeoples\xe2\x80\x99 Planning Campaign\xe2\x80\x9d(Peoples\xe2\x80\x99 Participatory Programme\xe2\x80\x94PPP for Local Level Self-Governance). The management of all the resources including the local natural resources was largely decentralized to the level of local communities and villages. Integrated, sustainable coastal zone management has become the concern of the local population.The paper assesses the socio-economic impact of the centrally enforced CRZ and the state sponsored PPP on the coastal community in Kerala and suggests measures to improve the system and living standards of the coastal people within the framework of CRZ.'

Abstract: 'AbstractWorld\xe2\x80\x99s human population is increasing rapidly day by day and has been reached to 7.324 billion by 2015. This rapid increase in the population is expanding energy demands and led to an energy crisis throughout the world, leading to the search for alternative sources of energy. Biofuels are an attractive solution for offsetting fossil fuels for a number of different reasons. There are various potential feed stocks for biodiesel production. From an economic and social perspective edible seed oil should be substituted by non-edible, lower cost and reliable seed oil for biodiesel production. We reviewed in this paper previously declared potential plant sources of biodiesel reported in Pakistan. Various related aspects of these feed stocks has been reviewed from numerous current publications, including oil extraction techniques, fatty acid composition profile (FAC) of non-edible seed oils, biodiesel standards and characterizations. We concluded from our review that the easy availability of non-edible plant resources in various parts of the world pave ways for its use in biodiesel production. It can supplant the dependency on edible plant seed oil resources and to tackle with the devastating crises of energy in Pakistan and worldwide.'

Title: 'The use of MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index to study spatio-temporal variation in vegetation phenology over India'
Author: 'J.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIndia has a diverse set of vegetation types ranging from tropical evergreen to dry deciduous. The phenology of these natural vegetation types is often controlled by climatic condition. Estimating phenological variables will help in understanding the response of tropical and subtropical vegetation to climate change. The study investigated the annual and inter-annual variation in vegetation phenology in India using satellite remote sensing. The study used time-series data of the only available satellite measured index of terrestrial chlorophyll content (MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index) from 2003 to 2007 at 4.6\xc2\xa0km spatial resolution. A strong coincidence was observed with expected phenological pattern, in particular, in inter-annual and latitudinal variability of key phenological variables. For major natural vegetation type the onset of greenness had greater latitudinal variation compared to the end of senescence and there was a small or no leafless period. In the 2003\xe2\x80\x9304 growing season a late start for the onset of greenness was detected at low-to-mid latitudes and it was attributed to the extreme cold weather during the early part of 2003. The length of growing season varied from east to west for the major cropping areas in the Indo-Gangetic plain, for both the first and second crops. For the first time, this study attempted to establish a broad regional phenological pattern for India using remotely sensed estimation of canopy chlorophyll content using five years of data. The overall patterns of phenological variables detected from this study broadly coincide with the pattern of natural vegetation phenology revealed in earlier community level studies. The results of this study suggest the need for an organised network combining ground and space observation which is at presently missing in India.'

Title: 'Type-segregated aerosol effects on regional monsoon activity: A study using ground-based experiments and model simulations'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Influence of different types of aerosols on regional monsoon activity examined.\xe2\x80\xa2More biomass burning aerosols in pre-monsoon and dust desert in monsoon seasons.\xe2\x80\xa2Absence of maritime and carbonaceous aerosols led to less rainfall in 2009.\xe2\x80\xa2Good agreement in AOD estimations between MACC reanalysis and AERONET data.\xe2\x80\xa2DREAM simulations corroborate AERONET-observed dust concentrations.AbstractClassification of observed aerosols into key types [e.g., clean-maritime (CM), desert-dust (DD), urban-industrial/biomass-burning (UI/BB), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC) and mixed-type aerosols (MA)] would facilitate to infer aerosol sources, effects, and feedback mechanisms, not only to improve the accuracy of satellite retrievals but also to quantify the assessment of aerosol radiative impacts on climate. In this paper, we report the results of a study conducted in this direction, employing a Cimel Sun-sky radiometer at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, India during 2008 and 2009, which represent two successive contrasting monsoon years. The study provided an observational evidence to show that the local sources are subject to heavy loading of absorbing aerosols (dust and black carbon), with strong seasonality closely linked to the monsoon annual rainfall cycle over Pune, a tropical urban station in India. The results revealed the absence of CM aerosols in the pre-monsoon as well as in the monsoon seasons of 2009 as opposed to 2008. Higher loading of dust aerosols is observed in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons of 2009; majority may be coated with fine BC aerosols from local emissions, leading to reduction in regional rainfall. Further, significant decrease in coarse-mode AOD and presence of carbonaceous aerosols, affecting the aerosol\xe2\x80\x93cloud interaction and monsoon-rain processes via microphysics and dynamics, is considered responsible for the reduction in rainfall during 2009. Additionally, we discuss how optical depth, contributed by different types of aerosols, influences the distribution of monsoon rainfall over an urban region using the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) aerosol reanalysis. Furthermore, predictions of the Dust REgional Atmospheric Model (DREAM) simulations combined with HYSPLIT (HYbrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) cluster model are also discussed in support of the observed features.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The inherent vulnerability assessment has been carried out for twelve villages.\xe2\x80\xa2Hazard generic framework considers using socio-economic indicators.\xe2\x80\xa2Inherent vulnerability was captured using eight sub-components and 16 indicators.\xe2\x80\xa2Inherent Vulnerability Score (IVS) was computed for each of the twelve villages.\xe2\x80\xa2Access to water was found to be an important determinant through IVS.AbstractThe study focuses on the assessment of inherent vulnerability of rural communities in Kimsar region to environmental hazards. A new conceptual framework was developed and hazard generic socio-economic indicators were identified in the assessment of inherent vulnerability of the communities to future harm. All the households from the selected villages were surveyed to collect information on the identified indicators. These indicators captured eight sub-components of inherent vulnerability, which includes lack of access to water, shelter, information, and connectivity, economic capacity, dependence on environmental resources, marginalised communities and gender. An Inherent Vulnerability Score (IVS) was computed, for each of the twelve villages by aggregating the data into a composite score. Sensitivity analysis was conducted for the composite score. The results obtained from a cluster analysis on the same village-level data were consistent with the IVS. Based on the results of cluster analysis, the villages were classified into three vulnerability groups \xe2\x94\x80 high, moderate and low. Access to water, dependence on environmental resources and shelter were found to be the most important determinants of inherent vulnerability in the region. Knowledge of inherent vulnerability will aid decision-makers to formulate policies, which will reduce vulnerability and help in rational distribution of resources among various communities.'

Title: 'Human impacts to mountain streams'
Author: 'Ellen'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X06002522
Abstract: 'AbstractMountain streams are here defined as channel networks within mountainous regions of the world. This definition encompasses tremendous diversity of physical and biological conditions, as well as history of land use. Human effects on mountain streams may result from activities undertaken within the stream channel that directly alter channel geometry, the dynamics of water and sediment movement, contaminants in the stream, or aquatic and riparian communities. Examples include channelization, construction of grade-control structures or check dams, removal of beavers, and placer mining. Human effects can also result from activities within the watershed that indirectly affect streams by altering the movement of water, sediment, and contaminants into the channel. Deforestation, cropping, grazing, land drainage, and urbanization are among the land uses that indirectly alter stream processes. An overview of the relative intensity of human impacts to mountain streams is provided by a table summarizing human effects on each of the major mountainous regions with respect to five categories: flow regulation, biotic integrity, water pollution, channel alteration, and land use. This table indicates that very few mountains have streams not at least moderately affected by land use. The least affected mountainous regions are those at very high or very low latitudes, although our scientific ignorance of conditions in low-latitude mountains in particular means that streams in these mountains might be more altered than is widely recognized. Four case studies from northern Sweden (arctic region), Colorado Front Range (semiarid temperate region), Swiss Alps (humid temperate region), and Papua New Guinea (humid tropics) are also used to explore in detail the history and effects on rivers of human activities in mountainous regions. The overview and case studies indicate that mountain streams must be managed with particular attention to upstream/downstream connections, hillslope/channel connections, process domains, physical and ecological roles of disturbance, and stream resilience.'

Title: 'Seasonal variation of black carbon aerosols over a tropical urban city of Pune, India'
Author: 'P.D.'

Abstract: 'AbstractBlack carbon (BC) aerosols were monitored continuously at Pune, a tropical urban location in southwest India, using aethalometer AE-42 model. Results of the data for the 1-year period (January to December 2005) have been discussed here. Seasonal and diurnal variations of BC in relation to changes in the regional meteorological conditions and local boundary layer characteristics have been studied along with the mass fraction of BC to the total suspended particulates (TSP) in different months. Also, using the Hysplit model, back-trajectories are studied to assess the sources for transported BC particles. The data collected during January to December 2005 indicated that annual average BC concentration (4.1\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x923) at Pune was comparable to that reported for other urban locations in southern Indian region. During winter season, BC concentrations were maximum (about 80% more than annual mean), mainly due to prevailing meteorological conditions like low wind speeds and low ventilation coefficients; as well as due to the transport from northeast regions. Minimum BC concentrations were observed during monsoon season (about 68% less than annual mean), which could be attributed to the wash-out effects due to precipitation as well as due to southwesterly winds coming from marine areas. Diurnal variation of BC showed two peaks, one in morning and another in the evening, which are mostly related to the daily changes in the local boundary layer. However, the intensity of local traffic emissions could have some impact on the magnitude of these peaks. BC aerosols formed about 2.3% of the total aerosol mass fraction at Pune.'

Abstract: "AbstractEquality between economic progress and environmental sustainability is essential for a developing country like India. In the present time, the economy of India is growing rapidly in a vibrant mode and an efficient way, which in turn demands huge uninterrupted energy supplies. The country's energy needs are met mostly by the usage of fossil fuels and nearly 70% of electricity is generated from coal based power plants. In India, nearly 840 million people depend on traditional biomass to satisfy their energy necessities. Approximately 74 million rural people do not have access to modern lighting systems and around 81 million households do not have access to electricity, which is a major challenge to India's energy security. In order to achieve stable sustainable energy in the long-run, significant progress in renewable energy sectors is needed. Favorably, due to India's geographic location, the country is blessed with abundant renewable energy resources, which has not yet been exploited completely. So the central and state governments of the country have framed various policies and are providing subsidies to encourage the utilization of solar photovoltaic systems. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the potential, current developmental status and prospects of solar energy of India is briefed. The various applications of solar energy such as water heaters, desalination units, pasteurizers, food drying units, water purifier, space heating systems, air-conditioning units, cookers, water pumps, aerators, solar-wind hybrid systems and grid connected photovoltaic systems are explained. The study also mentions the current renewable energy policies, the barriers blocking the progress of the solar manufacturing units and some possible future recommendations that might speed up renewable energy developments in India."

Abstract: 'AbstractBangladesh has been facing a power crisis for about a decade, mainly because of inadequate power generation capacity compared with demand and the ageing infrastructure of many existing power generation facilities. Only 20% of the total population are connected to grid electricity\xe2\x80\x9425% in urban areas and a mere 10% in rural areas where 80% of the total population resides. Currently, most power plants in Bangladesh (representing 84.5% of the total installed capacity) use natural gas\xe2\x80\x94the main commercial primary energy source, with limited national reserves\xe2\x80\x94as a fuel. Electricity supply to low-load rural and remote areas is characterised by high transmission and distribution costs and transmission losses, and heavily subsidised pricing.Renewable energy sources in Bangladesh, particularly biomass, can play a major role to meet electricity demands in the rural and remote areas of the country. The current study indicates that in 2003, the national total generation and recovery rates of biomass in Bangladesh were 148.983 and 86.276\xc2\xa0Mtonne, respectively. In energy term, the national annual amount of the recoverable biomass is equivalent to 312.613\xc2\xa0TWh. Considering the present national consumption of biomass, total available biomass resources potential for electricity generation vary from 183.865 to 223.794\xc2\xa0TWh. Biomass energy potential in the individual districts of the country has been estimated for the planning small- to medium-scale biomass-to-electricity plants.'

Abstract: 'AbstractCharacteristics of sea breeze circulations over a tropical Indian station have been studied, based on one year of observations, by Doppler Sound Detection and Ranging (SODAR) system at National Atmospheric Research Laboratory, Gadanki (13.5\xc2\xb0N, 79.2\xc2\xb0E), India. The effect of sea breeze circulations on the dynamics of low level flow patterns in atmospheric boundary layer over complex terrain in tropics is investigated. The study reveals that a sea-breeze front develops well along the eastern coastal plain of southern peninsular India and propagates over inland up to the distance about 80\xc2\xa0km. It is found that the sea-breeze signal is well recognized during the months of February, March and April due to the presence of tropical easterlies. In these three months, SODAR observations indicate a late afternoon intensification of sea-breeze flow in the height range 0.2\xe2\x80\x930.6\xc2\xa0km during 1400 and 2000 local time (LT). The decrease in temperature of 2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C and increase in relative humidity of 20% at surface level are observed on a sea breeze day as compared to a non-sea breeze day. Sea-breeze inland propagation is absent for the rest of the months due to the opposing meso-flow direction.

Title: 'Occurrence of sombric-like subsurface A horizons in some andic soils of the Nilgiri Hills (Southern India) and their palaeoecological significance'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper deals with four pedons (three Fulvudands and one Andic Haplorthox) located at high elevations (2000\xe2\x80\x932400 m a.s.l.) in the Nilgiri Hills on an old laterized surface of South India, and characterized by thick (50\xe2\x80\x93100 cm) epipedons whose colour tends to darken with depth. In two of them, the colour contrast between the top and the bottom A horizons was so well expressed that they were morphologically very similar to the African Oxisols reported to have sombric subsurface horizons. Soil organic matter (SOM) of the different selected A horizons was characterized by its mean residence time (MRT) and its \xce\xb413C value, whereas their humic acids (HAs) were examined by techniques that made it possible to determine their chemical composition and their chromatic properties. It was found that the darker colour of the subsurface A horizons of these soils was related to three joined characteristics: a SOM \xce\xb413C signature indicating a C4-type vegetation (i.e. a grassland-type) origin, the presence of humic acids belonging to the A-type (i.e. melanic) category of Kumada (Kumada, K., 1987. Chemistry of soil organic matter. Developments in Soil Science, Elsevier, Tokyo), and large mean residence time values. In contrast, the top A horizons had a more recent SOM, mainly inherited from a C3-type vegetation, and humic acids (HAs) that were less condensed than the A-type HAs. It was also found that where the presence of sombric-like subsurface A horizons was the most evident, the vegetation change recorded by the soils (i.e. the change from a grassland-type vegetation towards a C3-type vegetation) was expressed on the thickest part of their epipedon.These observations led us to propose that the occurrence of sombric-like subsurface A horizons resulted from the following sequence of events: (i) an exceptionally thick accumulation of organic matter deriving from grassland followed by (ii) its progressive replacement by less dark organic matter derived from a C3-type vegetation. This proposal was found to be in reasonable agreement with the history of the vegetation changes experienced by the Nilgiri Hills since the end of the Pleistocene. On the other hand, it is also very similar to one of the hypotheses proposed by Van Wambeke (Van Wambeke, A., 1992. Soils of the Tropics\xe2\x80\x94Properties and Appraisal. McGraw-Hill, New York) to explain the frequent occurrence of sombric horizons in the Oxisols and Ultisols of the high-altitude areas of Central Africa.'

It also argues that, while the value of the earth's ecosystems and natural capital may be large, at the margin, undiscovered pharmaceutical values of biodiversity and existence values are small. The challenge of biodiversity research is to make a stronger case for sacrificing economic development benefits for increased protection of biodiversity."

Abstract: "Sustainable development is an equitable, empowering, environmentally sound, economically viable process of growth. Energy is the key indicator of sustainable development. About 74% of the population of India live in rural areas. 80% of their energy needs are derived from biomass. About 92% of this energy is consumed in cooking activity. Women play a major role in biofuel management. Rural women's perspective in sustainable development is therefore critical.Declining biofuel resources, poor quality of the available biofuels and inefficient devices have pushed women into greater hardships. This paper examines the role of rural women in biomass management. The energy resources that rural women use, the strategy that the government and other organisations have adopted to alleviate rural energy problems and how these strategies have benefited women and improved their quality of life, the importance of incorporating the concept of \xe2\x80\x9cgender and development\xe2\x80\x9d in alternative energy strategies to achieve the objectives of sustainable development are discussed in this paper."

Abstract: 'AbstractAbove ground biomass production and nutrient distribution in growing Bamboo (Bambusa bambos (L.) Voss) from two days old (0.12 m height) to maturity (28.5 m height) were studied over five months. The average daily increase in height was 30 cm and independent of rain. There was a linear increase in the total above ground biomass for all components with the percentage contribution of culm maximum followed by branches, and leaves. Culm recruitment was monsoon dependent. The percentage distribution of N, P, K, Ca and Mg between components varied. Biomass equations were derived to estimate the green weight of the whole bamboo culm, the weights of the branches, leaves, and rhizomes and the relationships between the oven dry weights of various tree components as dependent variables and diameter (D), height (H), diameter and height (DH), square of diameter and height (D2H), square of diameter (D2), basal area (B), basal area diameter and height (BH) were determined. Of these, diameter and height (DH) was found to be most closely correlated with total above ground biomass. This was therefore used for the prediction of total biomass.'

Abstract: 'AbstractA land campaign, as a part of the Indian Space Research Organization-Geosphere Biosphere Program (ISRO-GBP), has been organized using a suit of instruments like AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) Sun/Sky sunphotometer, Microtops-II (MICROprocessor-controlled Total Ozone Portable Spectrometer), short-wave pyranometer from December 1, 2006 to April 30, 2007, over five locations (Ahmedabad, Pune, Sinhgad, Trivandrum and Gadanki) representing different environments. The dominance of different aerosol types such as biomass burning, urban/industrial pollution, marine origin and desert-dust particles is expected at these five sites. In all locations, significant day-to-day variability in AOD and \xc3\x85ngstr\xc3\xb6m exponent is observed. The \xc3\x85ngstr\xc3\xb6m exponent exhibits its lowest values over semi-arid region (Ahmedabad) 0.4\xe2\x80\x930.7, while it is around 1.8 at rural site (Gadanki). The retrieved volume size distributions for Pune, Ahmedabad and Trivandrum are found to be bimodal with varying concentration of each mode. Interesting feature of this observation is, very low coarse-mode volume concentration observed at Trivandrum even though observations were made about 300\xc2\xa0m from the coast. The synergy of results from these complementary measurements is reflected in the computed regional aerosol radiative forcing and heating rates. We have used a radiative transfer model (SBDART) to examine the variations of aerosol direct radiative effect (ADRE) and heating rates to give an overall estimation of the effect on climate. The ADRE, over different measurement sites, at short wavelength is found to be negative at the surface in the range of \xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa018 to \xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa059\xc2\xa0W\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa02, and TOA forcing values varied from +\xc2\xa00.9 to \xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa08\xc2\xa0W\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa02.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Measurements made over five different locations, representing different environments, reported. \xe2\x96\xba Significant spatial and temporal variability in AOD, SSA etc. observed. \xe2\x96\xba Very low coarse-mode volume concentration at Trivandrum, coastal site, observed. \xe2\x96\xba Model and measured fluxes showed good agreement. \xe2\x96\xba Large differences in surface as well as atmospheric forcing values found at all sites.'

Title: 'Renewable energy resources and technologies practice in Bangladesh'
Author: 'M.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032106000992
Abstract: 'AbstractBangladesh has very limited nonrenewable energy resources of its own. She is facing energy crisis and serious desertification problem in rural areas. These issues could be removed if renewable energy is used as a primary source of energy in rural areas. It is essential for scientists and researchers to find out the renewable energy resources and effective technologies. Bangladesh is endowed with vast renewable energy resources such as biomass and solar insolation. Besides, hydro and wind power can be considered as potential renewable energy resources. Harnessing these resources appears to be a promising solution for improving the quality of life of rural villagers. The government and many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have tried to comprehend and have strived to address the problem of energy. This paper reviews the renewable energy resources and renewable energy technologies (RETs) practicing in Bangladesh in terms of its implementation, research and development activities. The development and trial of systems are mostly funded so far by donor agencies in collaboration with government and NGOs.Biomass energy sources are traditionally used for domestic cooking and in small rural industries. Approximately 60% of total energy demand of the country is supplied by indigenous biomass based fuels. Activities on the development and promotion of biomass technologies have been going on for one decade. Some national and international funds have been available for biogas technology, improved biomass cookers and production of biomass briquettes. At the time, around 25,000 biogas plants exist all over the country in rural areas and educational institutes, etc. More than 0.20 million improve stoves have been installed to save biomass fuel. Over 900 briquetting machines have been operating in the country on commercial basis.The annual solar radiation availability in Bangladesh is as high as 1700\xc2\xa0kWh/m2. Research and demonstration activities carried out for one decade have led to a start of large-scale utilization of PV (solar photovoltaic) by various organizations and by NGOs. More than 61,500 solar PV systems of a total capacity around 3\xc2\xa0MW and 260 hot box cookers have been installed all over the country mainly in off-grid rural, hill tracks and coastal Bangladesh.Kaptai hydroelectric power plant is the only one renewable energy power generation plant of the country that is generating 3.28% of total 3651.20\xc2\xa0MW. The first micro hydropower unit of 10\xc2\xa0kW has been installed in a village of Bandarban through private initiatives. The project is providing electricity to 140 families in the village and to a Buddhist Temple.The annual wind speed at a height of 25\xc2\xa0m at some coastal locations is above 4\xc2\xa0m/s and much higher in the pre-monsoon and monsoon periods. The sites are suitable for power generation, particularly using PV or diesel hybrid technique for winter months.'

Abstract: 'AbstractSix years of spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements have been analyzed from a tropical coastal site, Trivandrum (8.55\xc2\xb0N, 76.9\xc2\xb0E, 3\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0msl) to infer on the seasonal changes in the microphysical properties of columnar aerosols, by examining the derivatives of the Angstrom wavelength exponent (\xce\xb1) in the wavelength domain (\xce\xb1\xe2\x80\xb2\xce\xbb) as well as in AOD domain (\xce\xb1\xe2\x80\xb2\xcf\x84) and by retrieving the columnar size distribution by numerical inversion of the AODs. The inference of the changes in the aerosol microphysics drawn from the features of the derivatives \xce\xb1\xe2\x80\xb2\xce\xbb and \xce\xb1\xe2\x80\xb2\xcf\x84 is consistent with the pattern revealed by the aerosol properties obtained from the columnar size distributions retrieved from the AOD spectra as well as from the surface measurements of mass-size distributions, which are supported by the back-trajectory cluster analysis and the results of chemical species analysis.'

Author: 'John A'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049964403000549
Abstract: 'AbstractLygodium microphyllum, Old World climbing fern, is native to the wet tropics and subtropics of the Old World and an invasive weed in southern Florida. Exploration for natural enemies of this weed was conducted between 1997 and 2002 in Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Caledonia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Two species of mites and 20 insect species were collected. The eriophyid mite, Floracarus perrepae Knihinicki and Boczek, was the most widely distributed and appeared to cause significant damage to the plant over time. Several unique geographical genotypes of F. perrepae were identified. Other promising candidates for further research are the musotimine pyralid species, Neomusotima conspurcatalis Warren, Cataclysta camptozonale Hampson, Cataclysta sp. 2, and Musotima sp., all leaf-feeders, as well as the stem-borer Ambia sp. All of the herbivores collected, except the eriophyid, typically occurred at low field densities. The pyralid species may reach high densities and cause great damage in Florida in the absence of their co-evolved natural enemies. The mite F. perrepae shows the greatest potential for biological control based on field surveys and initial laboratory observations; however, future studies must identify mite genotypes that are best adapted to the invasive Florida form of the fern.'

Author: 'H.I.J.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139396001539
Abstract: 'AbstractIn natural ecosystems, termites are typical ecosystem engineers and, in semi-arid ecosystems, often keystone species. It is thus likely that termites play a major beneficial role through promotion of essential ecological processes in agroecosystems in conflict with their well-established role as pests. This paper reviews the impacts of land clearing and preparation, cropping systems and management practices on termite diversity and activity. Current knowledge of the role of termites in agroecosystem function is discussed with reference to soil processes, vegetation cover, atmospheric gas exchanges and agricultural intensification. Methods for assessing termite diversity and function are outlined and priority research areas are suggested.'

Title: 'The taxonomic distribution of invasive angiosperm plants: Ecological insights and comparison to agricultural weeds'
Author: 'Curtis C.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320797000967
Abstract: "AbstractGlobal data sets of serious agricultural weeds (1348 species), widespread agricultural weeds (1041 species), and threatening natural area invaders (381 species) were assembled, and taxonomic patterns among these data sets were compared to gain insights into how these groups differ ecologically. Angiosperm taxonomic groups (families, orders and subclasses) were tested for over- and under-representation using resampling tests, and ecological characteristics of plant families were correlated with the prominence of each family in the data sets. As predicted by Baker's previously proposed attributes of \xe2\x80\x98ideal\xe2\x80\x99 weeds, many over-represented families among agricultural weeds contained primarily herbaceous, rapidly reproducing, abiotically dispersed species. The natural area invaders, in contrast, were represented by a more ecologically diverse range of families and were over-represented by more largely woody families. Families with at least some abiotically pollinated species averaged significantly higher proportions of natural area invaders (p = 0\xc2\xb7001) and agricultural weeds (p < 0\xc2\xb7001) than biotically pollinated families. Families containing climbing species were more highly represented among natural area invaders than families without climbers (p < 0\xc2\xb7009). While all non-native plants may carry some risk of becoming natural area invaders, this taxonomic analysis suggests that plants with amongst the highest risk of becoming natural area invaders worldwide include: species that are primarily aquatic or semi-aquatic, grasses, nitrogen-fixers, climbers, and clonal trees. Only 25% of natural area invaders were serious agricultural weeds, so quarantine legislation aimed at curbing the introduction of new agricultural weeds will be unlikely to prevent the introduction of most natural area invaders."

Title: 'River patterns and their meaning'
Author: 'C.R.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825204000212
Abstract: "AbstractRivers are largely responsible for shaping the Earth's continental landscapes. River patterns, the spatial arrangements of channels in the landscape, are determined by slope and structure. At site and sector scale, channel morphology varies spatially and in time, but river patterns and drainage texture, or the frequency of stream lines per unit area, together determine the intricacy, or otherwise, of topography. Most river patterns evolve through natural selection. Slope induces the formation of such patterns as parallel, radial and distributary, while structure produces straight, angular, trellis and annular arrangements. Once established, patterns tend to persist. Nevertheless, at many sites the usual patterns have been disturbed and patterns that are anomalous in terms of slope and structure have been produced by diversion, tectonism, volcanism, glaciation, mass movements, and human activities; by antecedence, superimposition, inheritance or underprinting; by the persistence of deeply eroding rivers which encounter alien structures; and by climatic change.River patterns provide clues to underlying structure and to the chronology of events. They have also proved significant in the search for minerals."

Title: 'ReviewThe Indian perspective of utilizing fly ash in phytoremediation, phytomanagement and biomass production'
Author: 'Vimal Chandra'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479709001546
Abstract: "AbstractCoal-based power generation is a principal source of electricity in India and many other countries. About 15\xe2\x80\x9330% of the total amount of residue generated during coal combustion is fly ash (FA). FA is generally alkaline in nature and contains many toxic metals like Cr, Pb, Hg, As and Cd along with many essential elements like S, B, Ca, Na, Fe, Zn, Mn and P. Dumped FA contaminates the biosphere by mobilization of its fine particles and hazardous metals. Despite the negative environmental impact of FA, coal continues to be a major source of power production in India and therefore FA disposal is a major environmental issue. To overcome this problem, FA dumping sites have been started as a potential resource for biomass production of tree species. Phytoremediation is a strategy that uses plants to degrade, stabilize, and remove contaminants from soils, water and waste FA. Phytomanagement of FA is based on the plants' root systems, high biomass, woody nature, native nature, and resistance to pH, salinity, and toxic metals. Recently Indian researchers mostly from the National Botanical Research Institute have been working on phytoremediation and revegetation of FA dykes, inoculation of bacterial strains for reducing FA stress and biomass production from FA dykes. Many international researchers have worked on reclamation, revegetation and utilization of FA. FA utilization saves resources, mainly land (topsoil), water, coal, limestone and chemical fertilizer. Safe utilization of FA is a major concern around the world and regulatory bodies are enforcing stringent rules for the proper management of FA. This article summarizes various viable avenues in India for FA utilization and environmental management."

Title: 'Ailanthus triphysa at different densities and fertiliser regimes in Kerala, India: growth, yield, nutrient use efficiency and nutrient export through harvest'
Author: 'Naveed'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112702006096
Abstract: 'AbstractA split plot trial involving Ailanthus triphysa (ailanthus) at four spacings (3m\xc3\x971\xc2\xa0m, 2m\xc3\x972\xc2\xa0m, 3m\xc3\x972\xc2\xa0m and 3m\xc3\x973\xc2\xa0m) and four fertiliser regimes (0:0:0, 50:25:25, 100:50:50 and 150:75:75\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 per year N, P2O5, K2O) was initiated in June 1991. Objectives included evaluating the growth and yield potential of ailanthus grown under differing density and fertiliser regimes and to estimate the nutrient export through harvest. Ninety-six randomly selected average-sized trees were felled at 8.8 years of age for assessment. Results show that height, diameter, stand leaf area index, biomass production and volume yield were greater in the 2m\xc3\x972\xc2\xa0m spacing. Repeated application of fertilisers at 1.2, 2.25 and 5.25 years after planting had little effect on biomass and volume yields, presumably because of weed competition (despite periodic weed control), higher pest incidence (in the heavily fertilised plots) and/or moderately adequate soil nutrient levels. Regarding partitioning of tree biomass, stem wood represented the principal component (>70%), while foliage contributed the least (<7%). Conversely, foliar N, P and K concentrations were the highest, followed by branch wood, coarse roots and stem wood. Denser stands showed greater accumulation of N, P and K with higher potential for nutrient export through harvest. However, as the bole fraction accounted for only about 56\xe2\x80\x9364% of the total nutrients removed, leaving other biomass components (foliage and branches) at the site will reduce the associated nutrient export. Wider spacings (3m\xc3\x972\xc2\xa0m and 3m\xc3\x973\xc2\xa0m) were more efficient in N and K use, but P use efficiency was higher in 2m\xc3\x972\xc2\xa0m. Likewise, trees in the no fertiliser plots exhibited greatest N, P and K use efficiencies. Available soil P, K and organic C levels declined with increasing tree density, while repeated fertilisation increased nutrient concentrations. Soil pH and available P levels declined in comparison to the pre-treatment values.'
